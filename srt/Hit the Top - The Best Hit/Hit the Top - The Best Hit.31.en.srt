1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,560
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,310
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,480
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,520
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,090
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,800
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,810
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,550
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,090
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,100
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,230
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,960
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,040
What happened?

14
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,010
I see that you woke up. Are you feeling alright?

15
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,450
Sorry? Yes.

16
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,480
But why am I here?

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,410
It looks like you lost your footing on the stairs.

18
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,630
Lost my footing?

19
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,760
You were passed out on the street in front of the building. The residents saw you and reported it.

20
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,830
The bottom of the building?

21
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,060
How long have I been like this?

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,440
You've been sleeping for quite a long time. It looks like you were very tired.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,140
You also talked in your sleep.

24
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,390
You must have been dreaming of the 1988 Olympics. You kept on saying, "Victory, Victory."
 TN: Woo Seung and victory are homonyms (우승)

25
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,530
Dreaming of victory?

26
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,280
Was I badly injured?

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,390
We need to run a few more tests,

28
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,640
but fortunately, it doesn't look like you have any serious injury.

29
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,970
- What is this for?
- You had a slight bruise on your head.

30
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,200
Anyway, tranquility is the most important, so get a good rest.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
And here ...

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,370
Mister Hyeon Jae, an autograph please.

33
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,220
- What?
- I'm really a fan, you see.

34
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,980
Why aren't you doing any activities these days?

35
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,320
Stop it, Nurse Park. Me first.

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,620
You see, my daughter is a big fan of yours.

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,670
Then everything until now was a dream?

38
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,140
Oh, Mister Yoo Hyeon Jae.

39
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,260
But you don't have any treatment today?

40
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,560
Ah, you came for the results of yesterday's checkup?

41
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,600
But you need to wait a few days for it, though.

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,690
Yesterday?

43
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,610
I came to the hospital yesterday?

44
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,230
Sorry?

45
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,010
Ah, yes. You came yesterday and got your treatment, you know.

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,630
But this is mine.

47
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,980
Hey! I told you not to touch my stuff, right?

48
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,590
What's yours?

49
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,530
That's my watch, you know it.

50
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,740
What? How is this yours? It's mine.

51
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,900
Then here as well, there is Yoo Hyeon Jae?

52
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,150
Sorry, what day is it today?

53
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,910
Today is the 17th.

54
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,220
The 17th of June?

55
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,860
Of course, of June.

56
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,850
- 1993.
- Sorry?

57
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,950
It's been a long time since 1993 has gone. It's 1994.

58
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,280
1994?

59
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,600
Hey.

60
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,420
Yoo Hyeon Jae died?

61
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,970
Yoo Hyeon Jae,

62
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:25,300
on the 17th of June 1994, at the age of 24, passed away.

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,600
The Best Hit

64
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,550
But you can't move yet.

65
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,460
- I'm a bit busy, you see.
- But!

66
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,440
Answer the phone, answer the phone.

67
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,920
Hello?

68
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,700
Gwang Jae. It's me, Yoo Hyeon Jae.

69
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,020
What's with you? Why do you keep—

70
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,980
You see, I...

71
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,770
I'm pretty sure I told you that I wasn't really that happy to have a phone call with you?

72
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,120
Hey, we already made up, you know?

73
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,480
What? I never!

74
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,410
I mean, you and I... Uh, later.

75
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,480
Anyway, I think you have to help me a bit.

76
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,890
I can't go there, so you'll have to come over here.

77
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,280
Ah really, you really know how to piss someone off, don't you?

78
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,760
Hey, Yoo Hyeon Jae! You little—

79
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,340
Gwang Jae. You're the only one who can help me now.

80
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,280
Come to Bear Coffee Shop, please. I know it's shameless, but please help me out this once.

81
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,480
Why would I go there? Really, tsk.

82
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,830
Forget it, if you've got nothing better to do then wash your feet and go to sleep. Hanging up.

83
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,200
Yoo Hyeon Jae? Are you in contact with Hyeon Jae, without us knowing?

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,120
No, what are you saying.

85
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,640
Forget it. It's fine. What were you saying?

86
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,320
What? Ah.

87
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,680
I was thinking about this while touching up the song.

88
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,440
It's not because I didn't have any idea, but from the start, we weren't really interested in dance or things like that,

89
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,660
so I was thinking about releasing a ballad album.

90
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,760
Are you listening to me?

91
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,480
Hey, Lee Gwang Jae!

92
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,150
What? Oh, yeah.

93
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,830
How come no matter if Yoo Hyeon Jae is here or not, you're not interested in me whatsoever?

94
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,470
What are you saying?

95
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,650
Hey, now our World Entertainment's figurehead is you, Park Yeong Jae.

96
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,860
You're saying this now that it all fell down.

97
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,640
Anyway, so this ballad album—

98
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,000
- I'll go out quick.
- What?

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,930
I'm in the middle of saying something important, where are you going?

100
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,140
I'll hear you out next time, okay? Next time.

101
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,290
You said I'm the figurehead.

102
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,090
You're the figurehead, you are. But later. Later.

103
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,450
I'm sure it was a call from Hyeon Jae, though.

104
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,900
These two, aren't they scheming something together?

105
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:50,130
♫  Someone is calling me. Is it you? ♫

106
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,500
♫ My heart is fluttering ♫

107
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,760
♫  I'm thinking of you again today ♫

108
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,470
When you said you were going somewhere quick, I thought you were going to some amazing place.

109
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,630
But it looks like you really just went somewhere quickly.

110
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,140
I just saw you, but I'm happy to see you again.

111
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,260
What are you saying, out of the blue?

112
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,800
When did we see each other?

113
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,860
There was something like that.

114
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,760
And you, really,

115
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,170
what's with that hair and your outfit?

116
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,110
Come on, really.

117
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,200
There was something like that, too.

118
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,840
Actually, it's good we met up. I had something to tell you anyway and was going to ask to meet up—

119
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,900
More than that, I have to find someone urgently.

120
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,990
Who? Who do you have to find quickly?

121
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,680
Yoo Hyeon Jae.

122
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,110
What?

123
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,640
I have to find me.

124
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,370
What are you saying? Are you drunk?

125
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,270
That's not it. Where should I go to meet Yoo Hyeon Jae now?

126
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,470
- I want to leave.
- Ah wait.

127
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,870
Okay, I know it's weird.

128
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,030
But you have a big network, I think you could find him right away if you look into it.

129
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,110
What nonsense is that? Finding you?

130
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,660
Found him! I found him, he's here, here.

131
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,540
That is...

132
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,040
Right! That is,

133
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,330
someone is going around impersonating me. Someone who looks exactly like me.

134
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,660
- What?
- So please look into the places where Yoo Hyeon Jae is now.

135
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,710
There will be one somewhere else, for sure. Not me, but another Yoo Hyeon Jae.

136
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,910
What are they saying? I can't hear a thing.

137
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,700
How did it go? Did you find him?

138
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,070
It looks like there really is someone who resembles you.

139
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,260
Really? Where is he, now?

140
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,620
That is, it looks like he was at the studio until not long ago.

141
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,710
He was working until this morning, and...

142
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,120
He was working, and?

143
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,850
He said he had something to do in Paju.

144
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,120
In Paju? Why there?

145
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,330
He said he had something to do with his family.

146
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,180
With his family?

147
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,130
- Let me use the car.
- What?

148
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,730
Ah really, I don't know why I have to be swayed around like this by you every time.

149
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,870
It's because you're my sole friend, you know.

150
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,970
Who is your friend, uh?

151
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,410
- Did you forget something here?
- What?

152
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,520
When did I go out from here?

153
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,990
You just went out.

154
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,780
Did I? Then what was I doing?

155
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,750
- Sorry?
- I must have been doing something, no?

156
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,380
- You said you would move your parents' grave.
- What?

157
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,090
You said you couldn't keep the grave anymore. That's what you said to me.

158
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,180
I did?

159
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,850
I did, right. Yes.

160
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,720
And I didn't say where I was going, did I?

161
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,350
No.

162
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,190
Sorry, is there a lake around here, perhaps?

163
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,560
A lake in the area? If you go a bit further, there is a lake called Water Lilies Lake.

164
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,490
Water Lilies Lake?

165
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,630
Water Lilies Lake...

166
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,990
The last whereabouts of popular singer Yoo Hyeon Jae has been found.

167
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,090
Yesterday afternoon, a month after his disappearance, on the side of a lake in Paju, Gyeonggi province,

168
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,100
a vehicle owned by Mister Yoo Hyeon Jae has been found.

169
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,010
You shouldn't go to the Water Lilies Lake.

170
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,980
Thank you.

171
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,950
It looks like I can't take care of you anymore.

172
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,020
You wished you had lived nearby here.

173
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:13,530
It looks like we'll be able to meet very soon, so don't be too saddened.

174
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,380
This is updated news on the typhoon.

175
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,550
We can say that it has completely entered the region of Seoul and Gyeonggi province, right?

176
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,890
That is how we should see it.

177
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,690
There must be a lot of people who remember last year's twin typhoon, Kaola.

178
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,400
This typhoon is also small in scale, but a similar twin typhoon—

179
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,100
Wh-What's this?

180
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,140
So there really was another Yoo Hyeon Jae!

181
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,720
Whoa, Thumbs Up!

182
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,910
What on earth? What are you?

183
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,010
Don't be too shocked.

184
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,500
Because I'm also you. That's not it, should I say that you are me?

185
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,830
What?

186
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,670
It must be difficult to believe, but I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae from 1993.

187
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,950
1993?

188
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,310
On that night in 1993 that you wanted so much to turn back,

189
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,310
because of a strange typhoon, I went to the future for a bit and ended up coming back here.

190
00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:00,670
So that is, when you experience it yourself it's a really big deal. But now that I try to say it, it does sound quite strange, right?

191
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,990
Well, so, uh.

192
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:15,600
Anyway, in the end, you came here because of Mom and Dad's ashes?

193
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,790
So this wasn't the worst-case scenario like I thought.

194
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,170
What are you saying?

195
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,250
You come out as having disappeared here, you see.

196
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,560
So I was trying to stop you from coming here at any cost, but whoa!

197
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,060
I didn't know I would end up meeting you here.

198
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,020
Really, there must actually be a fate that is impossible to change.

199
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,620
Then, you mean, you are me?

200
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,740
That's what I'm saying. At first I was confused,

201
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,820
but I figured it out when I saw the note you left at the bank.

202
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,420
What note? What are you talking about?

203
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,200
The money and the note you stored at the bank.

204
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,290
You did that to give it to Gwang Jae, right?

205
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,940
I did think about sending it to Gwang Jae. But how do you know this?

206
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,320
I am you, for one,

207
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,990
and I came from the future, I'm telling you. No.

208
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,980
That's not it. That is, originally I came from the past.

209
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,000
Anyway, that's how it is.

210
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,520
So that means you're me from 1993.

211
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,100
On that night in 1993, we received the golden cup at the Gayo Top Ten.

212
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,890
That evening you wanted so much to turn back.

213
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:44,600
Right, on that night I ended up drifting away from all of them.

214
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I thought all of it was my money. But I guess it wasn't true.

215
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,940
- So how are they living?
- What?

216
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,580
You just said you saw the future?

217
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,450
What about Bo Hee? Gwang Jae?

218
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:13,570
Th-That is, umm. It's a bit of a long story.

219
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,150
Well, I do tell stories excellently.

220
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,020
Where should I start?

221
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,300
Gwang Jae, Bo Hee and President Soon Tae, they were all living together.

222
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,170
And Yeong Jae this guy, he was really successful.

223
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,270
What's this? Who is it?

224
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,170
He looks really similar to Hyeon Jae.

225
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,600
Damn, this weather. At this rate, we might get struck by lightning.

226
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,030
Our fans are still the same, even though twenty years have passed.

227
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,840
They're as excellent as always, and amazing.

228
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,120
They still remember you, and they still give love to our songs.

229
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,950
Is that so?

230
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,820
Roar! ... Moo...

231
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,180
It looks like I don't have much time left.

232
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,930
What?

233
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,380
It's nothing.

234
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,390
About Ji Hoon. Can you tell me more?

235
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,040
What? I told you!

236
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,990
He's quite an okay guy.

237
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:37,420
Of course, he must be excellent since he's my son.

238
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,930
Right. He was really excellent.

239
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,900
Righteous to the point it's frustrating. Clever to the point of causing jealousy.

240
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,400
He also sings and dances fairly well. More than well enough to stand on stage.

241
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,480
With that, he could be full of himself, but he isn't at all, this kid.

242
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,990
And studying? Is he good at studying?

243
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,090
He went to the best university in the country.

244
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,090
He takes after me so he got smart brains.

245
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:15,660
I miss them. Gwang Jae, Bo Hee ...

246
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,390
and Ji Hoon, too.

247
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,290
Oh my! That scared me.

248
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,910
- Why is there such thunder?
- Because of the typhoon, of course!

249
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,270
Typhoon?

250
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,620
Perhaps, is this the twin typhoon?

251
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,570
I don't know!

252
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:45,340
Wait, I did kind of hear it on the radio earlier. That's right. It's the twin typhoon.

253
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,660
But why?

254
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,100
What time is it?

255
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,090
I left my watch at home.

256
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,810
If you go to World Entertainment from here as fast as possible, how long will it take?

257
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,390
- Why?
- I don't how it'll turn out, but let's go for it.

258
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,550
What are you talking about?

259
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,960
I'll tell you the details later. For now, start the car.

260
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,190
- Why is it like this?
- I brought a car. Let's take my car. Now.

261
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,720
I don't know, dammit.

262
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,020
Excellent Yoo Hyeon Jae.

263
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,840
What's this? The rain stopped.

264
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,150
There isn't much time left.

265
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,360
We have three minutes left. We have to go to the rooftop right away.

266
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,840
- So, why?
- We might have one more chance.

267
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,370
Quick!

268
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,470
You have nothing to lose, so you ride this downstairs first.

269
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,100
- What?
- Somehow, this might be able to send us to another world.

270
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,160
What are you talking about?

271
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,780
I also time traveled like this, from this rooftop.

272
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,580
There's no time. Quick.

273
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:34,750
In the future I came from, they say that they can treat your illness with medication.

274
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,410
No.

275
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,580
What do you mean, no?

276
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,890
I don't want this.

277
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,400
What?

278
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,320
Here is my time.

279
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,150
Think about it. I am the Yoo Hyeon Jae living in this world now.

280
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:09,420
If the future you talked about is the truth, there are things I need to complete here.

281
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:15,180
If there is anything I need to wrap up, I want to do it here.

282
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,550
♫ Will I be closer to my dream? ♫

283
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,740
So there was a reason why I was being like this here, I see.

284
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,990
♫  Or will I be frozen like my clock? ♫

285
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,500
♫ Light in the sky ♫

286
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,180
And if you meet Ji Hoon again...

287
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,510
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

288
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,460
Give him this for me.

289
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,200
♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

290
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,930
But you are dying.

291
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,440
♫ Fly, fly ♫

292
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,130
I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae. I won't take it just like this.

293
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,430
You said there's no time.

294
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,830
♫  Flowers that haven’t bloomed  ♫

295
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,740
Go back to the time you should be in.

296
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,440
Hey, Yoo Hyeon Jae.

297
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,470
Also...

298
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,110
♫  Will shine brightly once the sky clears ♫

299
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,450
Thank you for coming.

300
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,930
♫ Light in the sky ♫

301
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,490
You really...

302
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,810
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

303
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:34,840
♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

304
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,120
♫  Some day, fly fly fly ♫

305
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,150
♫ what makes you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful life ♫

306
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:50,810
♫ Life is still beautiful ♫

307
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,490
Lee Ji Hoon! Are you almost done?

308
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,180
Why are you going so early in the morning?

309
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,980
On public TV they usually do a lot of rehearsals, so they start at dawn.

310
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,350
Why aren't they coming?

311
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,300
It's your first time on public TV, what if you're late?

312
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,450
We were trying to get it right until the last moment.

313
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,770
Ahjumma. No, Ahjussi. That's not it.

314
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,810
Miss.

315
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,590
President. I'm sorry.

316
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,200
Are you alright? Your face seems a bit white.

317
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm alright. My heart...

318
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,800
My heart...

319
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,190
Bro. Where is my heart?

320
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,960
Here, here, here.

321
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,770
There's nothing to be nervous about, just do as you always do.

322
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,300
I'm envious, you're going on public TV.

323
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,040
President, aren't you discriminating too much? You don't even get us onto any broadcasts.

324
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,290
There is a response to these two. What do you want me to do? You two wait a bit, okay?

325
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,750
What are you doing, get on now.

326
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,070
Wait a bit.

327
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,450
Oh you're handsome, my son.

328
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,120
All good. Go now.

329
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,560
- We'll go.
- Do well.

330
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,910
Oppa, Oppa!

331
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,090
Mal Sook. Oppa is busy, what is it?

332
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,510
What is this? My first autograph is for Mal Sook?

333
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,910
No. If you meet the oppas from Heaven Boys Crew, get an autograph for me.

334
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,150
- What?
- The oppas from Heaven Boys Crew,

335
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,050
don't miss one and get all of them.

336
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,350
I got it, I got it.

337
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,390
And...

338
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,520
It's something precious to me. This will protect you.

339
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,570
And mine, Mal Sook? I'm the one who should be protected. What about mine?

340
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,520
Stop it, you have to get on now. Get on.

341
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,510
- Goodbye.
- Bye. Good luck!

342
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,050
Go well.

343
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,690
You must do well! Good luck!

344
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,050
♫ Something to tell ♫

345
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,920
I'm suddenly hungry.

346
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,670
Ahjumma, I think there's a beggar in my stomach.

347
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,290
Mal Sook.

348
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,430
I told you not to call me Ahjumma but Mom, now.

349
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,240
Ah right. Mom.

350
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,550
Should we make some delicious noodles to eat?

351
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,950
- Okay, Mom!
- Let's go!

352
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,730
♫ I’ll tell you, I love you ♫

353
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,910
It feels weird that the kids we saw every day became our juniors.

354
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,230
- Their song was really good, right?
- Yeah.

355
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,430
It even scored a fairly high rank on the music charts.

356
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,730
They need to score a proper hit for real.

357
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,200
I would be glad if they score a hit.

358
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,230
Me too. A good, proper hit.

359
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,210
Yes, Director. It's been a long time.

360
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,790
- Oh, our kids?
- Good morning.

361
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,690
Welcome!

362
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,850
- Of course, they can do entertainment programs!
- What's with "Welcome"?

363
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,870
- I'm out because of Music Top Ten, now.
- What?

364
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,790
- Good morning!
- Welcome!

365
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,730
When the broadcast ends, I'll be going up right away.

366
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,790
Yes.

367
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,550
Hey, there seems to be a lot of directors who saw you in a good light.

368
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,930
It's here!

369
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,600
Jay B!

370
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,690
Chairman really made a terrific name.

371
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,830
Music Top Ten
JayB

372
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,170
Yes, Director. Ah yes, wait a second.

373
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,890
Old student? I didn't know I would meet you here.

374
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,490
Do Hye Ri, you also have a broadcast today?

375
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,160
What are you saying? Don't you know we're nominees for first place today?

376
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,360
Really? It hasn't been long since you debuted, but so soon?

377
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:54,600
Well I heard we are in the top five girl groups, but is that of any importance? Winning first place is what matters.

378
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,170
But why is he like this?

379
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,390
He must be nervous. He has something similar to stage fright.

380
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,220
Bro. That won't do. Should I go to the bathroom once more?

381
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,190
Fierce Hye Ri, are you crazy?

382
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,850
- Dimwit. You shouldn't let yourself be eaten up. You should be the one eating others.
- What?

383
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,230
There's no place for herbivores on the stage.

384
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,520
If you get distracted, think of the smack I gave on your back. It'll probably burn until you get off stage.

385
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,840
I have to go. I'll probably see you often from now on.

386
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,410
- Old Student, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

387
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,130
How is it? Is there any effect?

388
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,010
There's none, none! Just my back hurting!

389
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,850
- JayB.
- Yes.

390
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,480
- You'll be going on stage.
- Yes.

391
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,280
Yes.

392
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,010
Bro. You're ready, right?

393
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,660
Bro. I'm putting my trust in you.

394
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,370
Let's go.

395
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,160
♫ When I still see you ♫

396
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,070
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

397
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,940
♫  I remember when we first met ♫

398
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,780
♫  You’re still so beautiful ♫

399
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,670
♫ When I still see you ♫

400
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,600
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

401
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,460
♫  I remember when we first met ♫

402
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,140
♫  You’re still so beautiful ♫

403
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,900
♫ Do you remember when we first met? ♫

404
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,890
♫  I went to see you every day. Fool! ♫

405
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,440
♫  I went to where you worked ♫

406
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,620
♫  I stole glances at you every day ♫

407
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,660
♫  Back then, I was so young ♫

408
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,350
Yes, this is World Entertainment.

409
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,460
No, the president isn't here at the moment.

410
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,140
♫  I will treat the beautiful you ♫

411
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,430
He must not be reachable because of JayB's schedule, probably.

412
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,760
Yes, I will tell him to call you.

413
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Yes.

414
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,960
Team Leader Choi!

415
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,290
You must be coming back from a workout?

416
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,600
♫ Though you can’t cook ♫

417
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,630
♫  I’ll still eat it ♫

418
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,140
Since I don't have any activity for the time being.

419
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,270
You said you're writing songs. Shouldn't you be full-on busy these days?

420
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,890
Well, I am looking into it. But I keep getting distracted, it's not working well.

421
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,850
You keep on calling me team leader when we don't even have any team members. Are you going to keep this up?

422
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,530
So what if there are no team members? They say you're the team leader.

423
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,530
There's not even one employee other than me, here.

424
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,550
You put team leader on your business card.

425
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,780
It's the president who set it up as team leader, you see?

426
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:07,800
Anyway. By the way, is there any song you wrote?

427
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,120
Me, what...

428
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,320
I know it all. I heard you're studying composition, these days?

429
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,970
If there's anything you wrote, show me a bit.

430
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:22,390
Well, if I show you ... are you going to take them for yourself?

431
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,510
Ah really! Rubbing salt in the wound.

432
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,700
I should go have lunch. I'm hungry so I can't think properly.

433
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,040
- Tell President that I came by.
- Yeah.

434
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,510
Right. You didn't get any contact from Master?

435
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,130
What?

436
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,860
No.

437
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,930
The Best Hit

438
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,270
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
