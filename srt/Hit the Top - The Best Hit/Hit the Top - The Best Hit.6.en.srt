1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,640
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,330
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,510
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,650
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,200
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,700
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,760
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,740
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,190
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,330
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,010
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,440
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,010
Hey, you are doing very well these days.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,710
I know that much from watching you on TV.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,160
Hey, but where on earth did you find people like those kids?

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,940
About me? I'm just fine.

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,080
But, you know...

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,230
The thing is that I was wondering if you have some mone—

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,190
What? What interview do you have all of a sudden? At this time?

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,340
Ah, hello? Hello?

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,830
Aish. If you dislike being asked, you could have said no. Why does he make up a sudden interview as an excuse?

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,490
You're coming back now? Where did you drink so much?

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,510
Gwang Jae.

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,680
CEO Jeong... He's dead.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,160
If it's CEO Jeong,

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,420
he used to be the CEO of Top Records?

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,620
But, he was so hale and hearty not long ago. Why all of a sudden?

28
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,570
He had a heart attack. That jerk was the last one to have a birthday since he was the youngest.

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,460
He didn't have to die so soon.

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,310
Then we'll eventually die like him, in vain, with nothing.

31
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,550
What are we here for?

32
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,810
Right. I struggled so much to survive in life, but it's not a big deal.

33
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,850
It's better to die soon. I should leave.

34
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:28,100
Without any regrets or resentments.

35
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,740
Hey! Hyeon Jae, you damned punk!

36
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,500
If you want to take me with you, come quickly to get me.

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,060
Hurry up, you damned punk!

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,150
Come on.

39
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,010
What?

40
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,810
Hyeon Jae?

41
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,500
No. It's not like that.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,860
I can't go.

43
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,510
I was just speaking nonsense, you punk.

44
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,510
Not yet. Punk, I can never go. I can't!

45
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,130
- Excuse me, President...
- Don't come near me! Don't come!

46
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,490
- You punk, stay away from me!
- No, I...

47
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,060
Don't come near me!

48
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,840
What's wrong with him?

49
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,890
Gwang Jae! Gwang Jae!

50
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,240
Hey, Gwang Jae.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,480
Ah, why are you doing this again?

52
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,280
Hey, hey! Hyeon Jae... Hyeon Jae is...

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,160
- Hyeon Jae?
- Yes.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,150
Hyeon Jae... That damned punk, Hyeon Jae...

55
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,940
What about Hyeon Jae? Did you see him or what?

56
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,400
Yes, I saw him. That person, Hyeon Jae, came here to take me with him.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,240
- I told him to not come near me!
- How much did you drink today? Ah, really!

58
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,330
I have a lot to study already.

59
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,790
Ah, I'm about to get a mood swing.

60
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,790
- Ah, really.
- Wow! So much garbage.

61
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,840
Ah? Finger flick!

62
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,150
- Why are you here?
- Me? I'm hungry.

63
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,870
How can you eat at a time like this? You don't even know who you are?

64
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,010
Then should I starve myself to death to help me remember?

65
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,910
Wow! What are all these? You had another accident?

66
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,180
Even if it's not you, there are a lot of annoying things happening to me already, so go ahead immediately. Just leave.

67
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,040
I was going to leave anyway. Don't worry.

68
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,560
Ah. When will I clean up this mess?

69
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,300
Hey, wait a moment!

70
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,680
Back, back, back, back, back.

71
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,140
- Me?
- Can you help me clean this up?

72
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,610
What is she saying now? You are talking to me right now, right?

73
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,620
- If you clean all this up...
- What if I put it away?

74
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,240
Ah, this is unbelievable. I don't know who you think you are or what do you think people are?

75
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,350
I'll give you a handphone.

76
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,210
Ah, the smell is bad.

77
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,410
There is still a lot more over there.

78
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,750
I know. I know.

79
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,980
- What are you doing over there?
- What?

80
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,880
Don't you know?

81
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,470
Don't live too diligently. It's useless.

82
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,560
If you think about it, that kid Ji Hoon and you...

83
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,290
Both of you, tend to live so diligently in vain.

84
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,390
You little!

85
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,870
Here. Pull it out like this.

86
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,630
Like this?

87
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,540
And pull out the other side like this. This is how you peel it.

88
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,310
Ah. It looks easy to do.

89
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,710
What? You saw it? I just peeled it properly.

90
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,280
That's absolutely awesome, right? Thumbs up!

91
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,310
That's a big deal. You are amazing.

92
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,740
Why do you guys eat this all the time?

93
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,860
- What? T.G?
- T.G?

94
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,900
If it's Sam Kim, then you have Kim Young Sam, Kim Dae Jeong, Kim Jong—

95
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,980
T.G stands for triangle gimbap.

96
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,360
Ah. But, can this be called a meal? It's not some kind of child's play.

97
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,710
It's cheap.

98
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,900
But you look really strange to me.

99
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,440
Even though you don't remember a thing, how can you forget how to peel a triangle kimbap?

100
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,400
This is something your body usually tends to remember.

101
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,710
Or unlike how you look, were you originally born with a silver spoon in your mouth?

102
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,340
With a silver spoon in my mouth? Why do you guys always talk about wealth and stuff like that?

103
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,400
It's because I'm resentful, why?

104
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,430
That's nothing to be resentful over. There are all kinds of things.

105
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,760
Later, I'll buy you anything you want. Just wait.

106
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,360
While we are at it... Can you buy me one more?

107
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,650
The tuna mayonnaise kimbap. I wonder what it tastes like.

108
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,380
How did you two end up coming in together?

109
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,990
Somehow it happened.

110
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,230
I ate a triangular kimbap... No. I mean...

111
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,270
I eat a T.G. And I know how to peel it.

112
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,370
World Entertainment

113
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,490
Hey, come out. Come out. Come out.

114
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,880
Where did it go? You haven't touched the drawers here, right?

115
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,650
Why would I touch them? I don't like touching others' stuff.

116
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,650
Then, where could it be?

117
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,990
What is it?

118
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,870
Bro. Haven't you found it yet? The victory bracelet.

119
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,060
No, I haven't. It's not here.

120
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,450
The victory bracelet? What's that?

121
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,920
Ah. Our Ji Hoon is a huge fan of LG Twins.

122
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,430
You know this is a fairy's bracelet that has an intuitive winning rate of 100%. The Team always wins when Ji Hoon wears it.

123
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,690
He always wears it on important occasions.

124
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,390
Aish. He should have it for our monthly evaluation.

125
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,120
Aigoo. It seems you two are putting a show. What a show.

126
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,750
Ah, I found it.

127
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm definitely sure it was that damned guy, Hyeon Jae.

128
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,030
Here. Honey water. Why did you drink so much?

129
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,550
You should think about your age now.

130
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,220
Do you really think I was mistaken because I was drunk?

131
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,930
No matter how I look at it, it's definitely Hyeon Jae.

132
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,980
Where on earth was this photo taken?

133
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,820
Hey, let's eat. Come down.

134
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,080
Sit down.

135
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,420
Ji Hoon. Eat with this for today.

136
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,550
- What?
- Your exam is today.

137
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,600
You have to pick the correct answers well.

138
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Hey. What do you mean?

139
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,020
- Here you are.
- What is it?

140
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,370
I've been saving this, but I'm giving it to you for good luck this time.

141
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,080
Hey.

142
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,460
Wait. What am I supposed to give you?

143
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,340
- Ah? Right, here you are. Make sure you do it well.
- Yes.

144
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,940
Why are you burdening your kid so unnecessarily?

145
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm not burdening him. I'm cheering for him.

146
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,470
Cheering to show your support or whatever you did will burden him in the end.

147
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,230
Just relax when you take the exam. That's it.

148
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,000
Ah. If by chance... If by any chance you don't know the answer,

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
tThink of your dad who goes around the countryside day and night to make money in the hot weather.

150
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,560
Think of this ragged old house which is about to collapse, and think of me who needs to get four implants.

151
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,630
You'll remember the answer without any trouble.

152
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,740
Ignore him, Joon.

153
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,110
Why would he ignore and elder like me says? This person.

154
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,060
- Why did you bring up the implants?
- No. I just meant...

155
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,560
Oh, why to fight over it? Please eat quietly.

156
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,630
- Okay. I got it.
- Mal Sook, eat slowly.

157
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,240
- What are you doing?
- I'll deal with you later. Aigoo.

158
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,930
My son! My son!

159
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,370
Eat these sticky rice cakes. They're for good luck.

160
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,100
- Take them out one by one when you get hungry.
- Yes. Thanks, I'll eat them well.

161
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,300
I'm sorry for not always paying much attention or caring for you.

162
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,750
Not at all. It's fine. I'll be back.

163
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,300
- Son, fighting!
- Fighting!

164
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,300
See you.

165
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,240
Hey! Wait!

166
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,190
You haven't gone yet. That's great. Here you are.

167
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,330
- I have money.
- Just keep it to yourself.

168
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,440
I wanted to give you a ride, but I have an event in Suwon at lunch.

169
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,930
- I'm fine.
- Ji Hoon, you're smart.

170
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,670
Don't burden yourself and relax while you take the exam. Okay?

171
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,530
Yes. I'll be back.

172
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,250
He won't mind if I only drink this one, right?

173
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,440
I heard you're taking an exam.

174
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,630
It's the last one. You eat it.

175
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,480
I don't think we are people who exchange the one thing we have left with each other.

176
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,510
Think of it as a token of appreciation for the handphone.

177
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,800
It's not even worth the price of the handphone, but I'll eat it well anyway.

178
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,370
Choi Woo Seung.

179
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,540
What are you doing here? Are you going to take the exam too?

180
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,970
I submitted it because of my dad, just in case. You never know what might happen.

181
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,580
That's totally the perfect crime. If you look at it carefully, you have quite a meticulous side.

182
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm here. What about you?

183
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,540
What? I'm over there.

184
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,780
- Choi Woo Seung.
What's with you?

185
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,860
Fail the exam. No matter what.

186
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,540
You too. I hope you fail.

187
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Ah, wait a moment. Wait! Give me your hand.

188
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,240
- What's this?
- I'm specially lending you my luck

189
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,840
so that you can pass no matter what.

190
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,700
What good luck? I'm going.

191
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,870
♫ On the rainbow colored street, people smile ♫

192

♫ You make me smile as well ♫

193
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,650
Now, please pass the exam papers in front of you to the back.

194
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,740
Do not look at the exam paper yet.

215
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,630
Shouldn't you say hello to your sunbae at least?

216
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,710
Is that your lunch? Are you trying to starve to death this time?

217
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,620
I do hope you don't talk to me.

218
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,700
I'm giving you a piece of advice as a sunbae.

219
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,280
Hey. Like I said, we're doing this all to make ends meet so you should eat as much as you can.

220
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,800
I know you worked harder than anyone else. I hope that you have as good results as the effort you put in. Fighting!

221
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,210
This is not like him. The handwriting is pretty though.

222
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,420
Student. If you keep moving like that, it will be considered cheating.

223
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,240
I'm sorry.

224
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,310

Are you okay?

233
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,840
Yes. I'm okay.

234
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,920
Choi Woo Seung. You can do it.

235
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,180
You have to hold it in. How? How could you overcome this?

236
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,770
Even if you die, you have to hold it in. I can't stand it.

237
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,300
- What's wrong over there?
- Bathroom. I need to go.

238
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,210
Once you leave, you can't re-enter. You know, right?

The kids in red are almost confirmed, so I think you only need to focus on them.

243
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,820
Ah, is that right?

244

Oh... Today, I'm here to watch the audition...

260
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,890
I think he could be useful for entertainment on variety shows.

261
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,580
We should send him out. He won't do.

Where did MC Drill go?

270
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,180
- Bro.
- Are you okay?

271
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,380
Yes. I'm fine.

272

This time there's no place to hide anymore.

Yo. Stereotypes are said to be solid and fixed walls. I'm a man who drills holes in solid walls.

277

This is MC Drill. I'll show you some rap.

278
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,230
So, is that why he's called MC Drill?

279

Yo.

Excuse me. I'm sorry. Can I do it one more time please?

291
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,520
I think I have heard "oh, yo" like a hundred times. Forget it, that's enough.

292
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,650
- Yes.
- Next.

We already know you this much with all those basic moves.

297
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,280
Can you show us anything else? Something with more impact.

298
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,090
If I practice anything I can do it well.

299
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,600
- What if you don't practice? You can't do anything?
- Pardon?

300
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,860
Will you talk like that even during live broadcasts or concerts? That you'll come back after practicing?

301
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,010
I see you have never done any rap parts before.

302
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,370
Let him do a freestyle rap.

303
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,770
Is it possible?

304
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,350
Rap...

305
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,120
- Rap is not my specialty.
- Then let's just hear you do it once.

306

314
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,130
♫ In the end, I’ll get it, I pray every day ♫

315
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,800
♫ I’m only looking ahead as I run ♫

316
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,410
♫ At the end of this dark tunnel ♫

317
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,180
♫ There will be a bright light ♫

318
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,170
♫ I ran endlessly, locked up in hope ♫

319
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,990
♫ Yeah, I wanted to see that bright light ♫

320
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,160
♫ I thought I just had to go a little more ♫

321
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,650
♫ It felt like I could reach if I held out my hand ♫

322
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,600
♫ But why does it feel like I’m running in place? ♫

323
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,100
♫ It’s not enough yet, right? ♫

324
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,770
♫ If I wanna run again, I need to hold it in and get up ♫

325
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,120
♫ But there are so many things that make it hard to handle my reality ♫

326
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,030
♫ As if they’re trying to make me fall ♫

327
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,720
♫ But I’m trying to endure cuz I don’t wanna lose ♫

328
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,650
♫ It’s a dream I wanna fulfill with all I am ♫

329
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,900
♫  But why does it keep making it harder for me? ♫

330
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,070
♫ Why don’t they know how earnest I am? ♫

331
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,740
♫ Why are they playing with me? ♫

332
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,530
♫  I don’t expect much, that’s the only thing ♫

333
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,430
♫ But the more time passes, the more I wanna crumble down ♫

334
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,380
♫ Why must I throw myself into the responsibilities of the world? ♫

335
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,200
♫ Why do I have to endure that pain? ♫

336
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,870
♫  The world won’t leave me alone ♫

337
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,630
♫ I try telling myself that it’s not my fault ♫

338
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,130
♫  I can only avoid it and hide ♫

339
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
♫ If there is a God, please hear me out ♫

340
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,790
♫ This is all that I can do ♫

341
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,240
♫ And I hate it ♫

342
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,300
♫  I can only walk on a path of thorns ♫

343
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,760
♫  But I’m closing my eyes and shouting in my heart ♫

344
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,500
♫ I pray for my dream ♫

345
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,620
Thank you.

346
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,240
That was pretty good, old student.

347
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,560
Hey. If I do it like this trying to find a WiFi signal,

348
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,570
I'm going to be able to get internet, right?

349
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,510
Ah. Why can't I get any signal?

350
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,030
Oh, I got it!

351
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,650
Wait a moment. This...

352
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,760
Photo music

353
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,370
To my dear Hyeon Jae

354
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:45,180
Lastly, what should we do with Ji Hoon? It seems like he has potential.

355
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,910
Isn't he too boring?

356
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,080
His academic background might work for him as an advantage.

357
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,850
Isn't that friend Kevin better?

358
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,380
He's from Berkeley School of Music, and I could see his eyes are full of craziness.

359
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,230
I found him interesting to watch.

360
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,900
Well, what's his nationality?

361
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,110
He's from the US. His father has been a consul for a long time.

362
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,870
Is that right?

363
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,370
Okay. Then he'll be the last member.

364
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,120
Why has he been doing that for a while?

365
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,210
There is just some reason for that.

366
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,770
♫ I’m dreaming again ♫

367
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,930
♫ The dream I wanted ♫

368
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:03,570
♫  I pray with my hands together ♫

369
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,970
♫  Sometimes, I stop and look at the sky ♫

370
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:16,830
♫  Because I still have a dream to fulfill ♫

371
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,110
♫ I have a dream ♫

372
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,780
♫ I have a dream ♫

373
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,390
Is today a poor-looking concept?

374
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,270
Why did you come out?

375
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,530
Why aren't you coming in?

376
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,860
Just because it's cool out here.

377
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,340
Did you do well on the exam?

378
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,510
So so.

379
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,550
Good job.

380
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,210
What about your monthly evaluation?

381
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,770
Same here, so so.

382
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,060
Good job, too.

383
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:14,170
Take a sip, though it's mine. Let's do the loyalty test.

384
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,110
♫ After a long night passes ♫

385

♫  And tomorrow comes again ♫

386
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,930
Has something happened to you?

387
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,770
Nothing.

388
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,010
♫ Will I be closer to my dream? ♫

389
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,250
♫  Or will I be frozen like my clock? ♫

390
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,050
Go see a doctor at a hospital now that the exam is over.

391
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,860
♫ Light in the sky ♫

392
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,550
I should.

393
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,910
It keeps bothering me.

♫ The sky ♫

395
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,490
How come I have this kind of thing disorder?

396
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,270
Seriously.

What are you two doing?

408
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,060
What's that? Where's that sound coming from?

409
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,660
Additional scenes

410
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,590
Ah. This hurts.

411
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,720
- Let me use the bathroom.
- Sure.

412
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:55,290
It was a dream. You must have dreamed of him. Please go to your room, now.

413
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,160
Hey, punk! It was really Hyeon Jae.

414
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,980
Why don't you believe me, you rascal?

415
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,280
I really cannot go to sleep alone tonight.

416
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,650

Do one part-time job for me.

One million won? What part-time job?

430
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,480
This isn't the feeling I'm looking for.

- The shooting schedule is a bit tight. We're in a hurry.
- Director!
