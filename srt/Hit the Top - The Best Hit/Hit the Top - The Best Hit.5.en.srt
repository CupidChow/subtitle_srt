00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
The Best Hit

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,220
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,430
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,730
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,540
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,920
Lee Se Young
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,100
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,360
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,090
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,770
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,750
I have to stay here somehow.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,410
Leave me! I'll find him howsoever.

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,100
- That's what I'm asking, how?
- Any way possible!

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,250
Excuse me!

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,930
- Oh!
- You, This...!

18
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,230
Hey! Hey!

19
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,130
Ah, really!

20
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,320
This is crazy!

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,310
Anyway, you thief! I was on my way to find you.

22
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,060
My car! Where is my car? I said, where is my baby right now?

23
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,200
You, seriously! Hey...

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,540
My stuff. Give me back my stuff! Give it back, you thief!

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,830
- Give me my baby back!
- Leave me! Why are you doing this ?!

26
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,970
Stop, stop it! Calm down!

27
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,610
- Hey!
- So that's why I...

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,770
Give me back my stuff!

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,430
- Get away, move!
- You, seriously!

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,480
Since I was hit by your car, I don't remember anything.

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,540
I don't know who I am, where I live, what I used to do.

32
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,310
So... For the time being, I'm afraid

33
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,120
I'll have to live with all of you guys.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,550
- Are you saying you have amnesia, or something like that?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,950
Amnesia, my foot!

36
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,840
This person. There's nothing more to hear about him. He's totally a conman.

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,580
Bro! There's not just one or two things that are suspicious.

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,070
Are you really a conman?

39
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,530
Conman. Really!

40
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,080
If you guys knew who I really was...

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,420
Do you remember who you are?

42
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,720
I don't remember. But, I think I must have been a nice person.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,980
But, how did you know we live here?

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,340
Look! That's also suspicious!

45
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,780
What's suspicious? The thing is that...

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,660
- Ah. I asked the handphone.
- Handphone?

47
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,710
What's he talking about? Isn't this person lacking a little in the head?

48
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,470
What lacking? Ah. If you guys knew who I was...

49
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,330
Do you remember?

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,210
I don't remember. But, I think I must not have been the type of person you are thinking of.

51
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,090
Then, what should we do?

52
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,680
What about it? He's totally a conman!

53
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,910
He ran in front of our car yesterday! Stealing our car was suspicious!

54
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,230
Now suddenly showing up and faking amnesia is funny.

55
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,030
- Right! It's strange!
- And...

56
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,710
When did you start speaking this informally to us? Since last time?

57
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,600
What about speaking informally? If you guys knew my age...

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,580
Do you remember your age?

59
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,050
I don't remember. But, I obviously seem older than you guys.

60
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,180
You don't remember but do think a lot, right?

61
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,280
Forget it! Go to the police station.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,970
- Why police station?
- Once we report you they will do an identity check on you and we'll know

63
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,390
who are you and where are you from!

64
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,650
Your name is... Yoo Bong Jae.

65
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,590
Bong Jae?

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,860
Yoo Bong Jae!

67
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,770
That's a great name.

68
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,910
He was born in 1971.

69
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,820
Yes? 1970... Born in 1971?

70
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,350
If he is born in 1971...

71
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,580
He's 47.

72
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,980
And, he was declared dead after he went missing in 1994.

73
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,340
Yes? Something's strange.

74
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,150
Right. Something's strange. It seems the information is wrong.

75
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,630
Have you heard the name Yoo Bong Jae?

76
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,920
I... don't know.

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,340
Bong Jae, from now on your name is Joon Hyeok. Yoon Hyeok, here you are.

78
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,500
The President went to a very expensive fortune teller to get you this name.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,720
Joon Hyeok? It's a little weird.

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,840
Hey, dude. You're crazy. Joon Hyeok, what a good name is.

81
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,680
Do you know how much that name costs? No, right?

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,940
Do you know who Hwang Jeong Man is?

83
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,610
Who's that?

84
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,470
That is Hwang Shin Hye's real name.

85
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,130
- Do you know who Choi Hong Ki is?
- Choi Hong Ki?

86
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,980
That's Na Hoon Ah. Na Hoon Ah is Choi Hong Ki.

87
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:31,210
You see. Hyungnim Song Hae, Kim Bo Sung, Taejin, they all went to that fortune teller and got their names from there.

88
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,030
That's how they became this big and famous, you idiot.

89
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,310
What do you know? I get annoyed just by looking at you.

90
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,530
President, goodbye.
- Okay.

91
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,580
Hey, Joon Hyeok is nice. It looks like a student's name.

92
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,650
Hey, Joon Hyeok? But still, it sounds so lame.

93
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,240
There was a bug flying around while President kept talking. I'll catch you.

94
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,220
You dare to hide. Hey, you'll be bothering later early in the morning?

95
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,780
Dead Poets Society

96
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,810
Carpediem! Seize the present day!
Hyeon Jae: The present day

97
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,990
What about Hyeon Jae?

98
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,020
This is something that has been mistyped in the computerized database input.

99
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,860
It would be quicker to contact and ask the district office or city hall for this.

100
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,220
So, it seems it'll take quite some time.

101
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,890
It seems so. By the way, have you settled the accident with the victim?

102
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,540
How could I have so many unfortunate things happen to me all at once?

103
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,350
The exam is right in front of the corner. What am I doing now?

104
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,390
What is this?

105
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,870
What should we do now with that person?

106
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,800
There's no answer. I have no answer.

107
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,890
First, let's just take him in for now.

108
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,310
Bro. Take him in where?

109
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,980
We don't even know him. You want us to stay together?

110
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,840
Then what should we do? Do you have any money for the settlement?

111
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,460
What if he needs to be hospitalized to get treatment? That means money too.

112
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,760
Luckily, it's only temporary, just for a while until he recovers his memory.

113
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,970
This is not a dormitory or something like that.

114
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,830
Keep in mind that it's only until his memory comes back. Let's endure it for a few days

115
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,590
I can sleep here, right?

116
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,480
It's not just that he lost his memories. He also lost his common sense.

117
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,310
I can't sleep properly with others.

118
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,860
Then, use the attic room by yourself.

119
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,450
Hey! What about me?

120
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,750
Did you etch your name in the room? Is the attic yours?

121
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,940
- I was the one using it originally.
- I was originally hiding first and living here.

122
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,860
Be quiet.

123
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,690
if you're going to stay for a while, can't you stay in the living room if it's uncomfortable?

124
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,030
No. I can't do that.

125
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,370
I don't want to be uncomfortable, and I can't sleep unless I'm on a bed.

126
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,250
Do you remember a little?

127
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,840
I don't remember, but all I know is that I don't like sleeping anywhere unless it's on a bed.

128
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,150
- He's so unlikeable.
- Okay, then.

129
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,230
I see everybody needs a room. But, there aren't enough rooms.

130
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,570
Then there's only one way left.

131
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,400
What way?

132
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,900
So we'll be playing a game for it and we'll choose from there. No one can complain when the results come out.

133
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,820
But who is going to pick it?

134
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,380
We need someone to be the referee.

135
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,740
You have a delivery!

136
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,520
I'll do it for you since you asked it as a favor. I don't know what I'm doing here.

137
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,140
It'll only take a moment, Ahjussi.

138
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,960
Then, I'll pick one.

139
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,660
This game is called "The Finger Flick"!

140
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,860
Yes!

141
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,200
Starting from my left, we will go around taking turns in a circle.

142
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,610
Then, we'll start. I'm letting you know in advance that I'm definitely not going to go easy on you guys.

143
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,350
- Oh, I missed it.
- Okay, eliminated!

144
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,790
Get ready. Here I come.

145
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,590
Go ahead. Come at me. As much as you ca—

146
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,200
He's eliminated!

147
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,540
I'm Choi Woo Seung. Until now I've never lost at "The Finger Flick" game.

148
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,940
So, is it my turn now?

149
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,190
My nickname used to be The King of The Finger Flick game.

150
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,680
Are you okay?

151
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,980
Was I bit by a mosquito?

152
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,520
It's amazing.

153
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,150
A finger flick... This is how you do it.

154
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,120
He's eliminated!

155
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,020
Ji Hoon, were you this good at the finger flick? I never knew about it.

156
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,490
There's still a lot you don't know about me.

157
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,320
You're kind of cool.

158
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,710
Hey! Choi Woo Seung. Just use any room you want to!

159
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,130
Hey, Lee Joon! Are you okay?

160
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,410
Because I... I won...

161
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,270
You can use the room.

162
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,250
You're eliminated.

163
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,500
Start!

164
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,460
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon! Are you at home?

165
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,250
What to do? Hey! Guys, you need to hide.

166
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,660
Hey, you punk. Why don't you answer me when you are here?

167
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,390
What? I didn't hear you.

168
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,880
- But, who is he?
- I'm a delivery man.

169
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,150
- Why are you here, Mr. Deliveryman?
- I know, right?

170
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,000
- I was going to serve him a glass of water.
- Oh, really?

171
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,480
- Ah, I ordered some chicken. Come down to eat.
- Yes, I'll be right there.

172
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,590
Hey, what's wrong with your forehead?

173
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,410
Oh, I hit it on the corner of my desk earlier.

174
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,440
You should be more careful. Come down quickly.

175
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,690
What is that sound?

176
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,020
Well, I don't know. That sound must be coming from outside.

177
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,380
- Come down anyway. If you're late, there will only be bones left.
- Yes, Father.

178
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,730
Father? Then, he is Gwang Jae's son?

179
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,360
Eliminated!

180
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,750
Yes!

181
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,560
You all saw it, right?

182
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,770
Yay! Choi Woo Seung is the winner after all!

183
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,820
The Best Hit

184
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,750
You only get my room when you sleep.

185
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,190
- I don't think you two look alike at all.
- Pardon?

186
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,400
- Then, how old are you?
- Me?

187
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,540
I'm 23 years old. Why?

188
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,000
23 years old? He is the same age as me.

189
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,780
Forget it. You can go.

190
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,080
But, why do you keep speaking informally to me?

191
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,720
What?

192
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,970
Hey! Your father and I...

193
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,910
What about my father?

194
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,790
The thing is that...

195
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,250
You can do it too if it bothers you.

196
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,320
Okay then. I'll do it too.

197
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,550
But, do you really not remember anything?

198
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,600
I already told you that.

199
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,380
Tell me if you remember anything.

200
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,280
When did Gwang Jae have such a big son?

201
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,710
- Hey, Choi Woo Seung!
- What?

202
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,650
What are you exactly thinking about?

203
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:26,480
No. It's just that he seems so familiar to me. I must have seen his face somewhere else before.

204
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,020
Enough, already! Woo Seung. Let's sleep quickly.

205
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,470
But, why have you been calling me Woo Seung for a while?

206
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,920
What? Have I done it? Ah, I don't know. I don't know.

207
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,160
Ever since that girl hit me on the forehead, my head hurts so much.

208
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,410
I'm kind of dizzy.

209
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,030
- Let's go to sleep, bro.
- Good night, you too.

210
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:18,520
♫ This place is a little awkward ♫

211
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,960
♫  Like the secret I tell you ♫

212
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,270
♫ Although love is unpredictable ♫

213
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:40,470
♫ I feel like I'm excited about you ♫

214
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,530
Hong Bo Hee

215
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,450
Why do you bother looking at the internet dummies' bad comments about you?

216
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,920
I'm not looking at them.

217
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
Are you going somewhere?

218
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,710
I already told you there s a gathering for managers today.

219
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,930
Ah. Do you mean your wild rats group gathering?

220
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,080
Hey, what about the wild rats?

221
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,930
Who do you think led the Korean entertainment world this well up to now?

222
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,630
If it weren't for us, who were born in the Year of the Rat, there wouldn't be Hallyu (Korean Wave). Not even half of it.

223
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,310
Yes, sure. Have a safe trip back.

224
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,210
Okay.

225
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,460
Ah. I had something to tell you.

226
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:32,220
You see, I had a favor to ask of you. What was that again?

227
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,130
- Ah...
- What is it?

228
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,120
Oh, you know that... That thing that walks around. That chatty little thing.

229
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
- Mal Sook?
- That's right! Mal Sook!

230
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,390
Can you go and pick her up at her kindergarten?

231
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,480
- Okay.
- I'm going.

232
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,190
How could you forget Mal Sook's name? You, crazy man.

233
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,730
Hong Bo Hee, unpredictable talent for variety shows

234
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,630
Ms. Bong on-screen made us burst out laughing!

235
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,940
New concept of brainless naive girl appeared.

236
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,660
I burst out laughing!

237
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,390
I'm kind of funny.

238
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,540
I feel quite uneasy.

239
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,590
Do you think that rude guy is hiding well?

240
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,930
He'd better be hiding. I warned him to when I came out.

241
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,360
Why did you take my handphone without asking for it?

242
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,540
It makes me want to have a machine like that.

243
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,180
We'll be back, so don't forget what already I told you.

244
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,600
I know. I know.

245
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,150
- What was the first one?
- To hide if I hear someone coming.

246
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,390
- What about the second one?
- Never go outside.

247
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,320
You definitely can't get caught. It's over for us. The end.

248
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,420
If I get caught, It's over for me too.

249
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,010
Oh, Bro. Good news or bad news. There are both of them. Bro, what do you want to hear first?

250
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,420
Then... Good news?

251
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,520
The good news is that CEO Park will be present at the monthly evaluation tomorrow.

252
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,340
Wow! But, why is that good news?

253
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,720
That means that tomorrow's evaluation is an important one that will determine the members of the debut group!

254
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,670
What about the bad news?

255
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,410
The bad news is that...

256
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,580
It's a public evaluation.

257
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,690
If it's a public evaluation, then all the trainees will be gathered there?

258
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,040
Will you be okay? You're already having a hard time with your stage fright.

259
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,150
I almost got over such a thing like stage fright.

260
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,460
Okay. From the very beginning, stage fright never suited you.

261
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,440
Every moment in life is so hard. Tiring.

262
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,700
When I look at you, you look like a nice guy, too good to be true. How should I say it?

263
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,970
Oh, right. You look too straight.

264
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,720
It's poison to have some talent.

265
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,590
Ah, I don't know. As long as I keep trying anything, I'll definitely get the answer.

266
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,890
Ah. Why doesn't anything ever work out well?

267
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,070
Do you think the debut is up to me?

268
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,440
What confirmation?

269
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,790
No. How much more effort can I put in here? Then you put in more good effort if you like that, Mom.

270
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,400
This time, I was told that due to weight problems she is being demoted from her debut group.

271
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,650
Hey, you!

272
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,150
Hey!

273
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,650
What's wrong with you? Aren't you letting me go?

274
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,560
Hey, I won't! I can't!

275
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,430
- Are you crazy?
- I should ask are you crazy?

276
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,840
Why would you choose to die?! You lose when you die!

277
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,540
Hey, you should live! You'll have to live so that you can debut and become a star!

278
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,260
- Who is going to die?
- You...

279
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,420
You just now... You weren't going to die?

280
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,820
I told you to move.

281
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,770
How should I take this now? Do you hug anyone just by holding them from behind like this?

282
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,440
Should I tell the company exactly what I experienced today, right?

283
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,290
No, I just... I saw you take off your shoes...

284
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,580
It was because my feet hurt.

285
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,790
You were leaning against the rail like this.

286
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,550
Can't I look down?

287
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,820
No, of course not.

288
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,330
You're a trainee, right?

289
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,570
- The oldest one among all the trainees?
- What?

290
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,220
Yes.

291
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,480
Don't you know I'm part of the debut group?

292
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,270
I'll debut in the second half of this year, and I'm going to be the center of my team.

293
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,930
If one of us really wanted to die, who do you think it would be?

294
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,980
- You or me?
- Me.

295
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,360
Don't be presumptuous. Please know your place and live your own life!

296
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,730
1 dish per person
Take only as much food as you can eat.

297
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,920
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, you scared me!

298
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,910
- Who are you spying on?
- Why would I be spying?

299
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,940
Don't make your answer sound annoyed and get the car ready to move.

300
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,180
Is this all your land?

301
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,610
- So immature.
- What do you mean, immature?

302
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,200
Anyway, I've heard you're going around borrowing money from here and there.

303
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,880
Who said that?

304
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,650
Who cares who said that? Did you really think I wouldn't hear about you borrowing money all over the place?

305
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,000
What is it to you that you care whether I borrow or lend money? Mind your own business.

306
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,590
How can I not care when we are good neighbors?

307
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,690
Also, are we just neighbors?

308
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,050
That good neighbor's talk is ridiculous.

309
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,180
Hey, hurry and take out your car. Take your car and quickly go!

310
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,120
Please watch the store. I need to work out...

311
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,060
Oh, it's you. Yeong Jae! Long time, no see.

312
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,850
Yeah... yeah.

313
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,800
- You're going to work out?
- Yeah, I didn't get to exercise in the morning.

314
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,790
I just started going on broadcasts again, so I need to take care of myself.

315
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,640
See you later!

316
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,600
Well, she seems to do yoga.

317
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,180
Mind your business, whether or not she does yoga. Move your car quickly!

318
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,100
Okay, fine, fine!

319
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,480
Yes. From now on, I have an important meeting with an investor so don't put any calls through.

320
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,400
Yes, I understand. But President, with who?

321
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
There is someone. Would you know if I told you?

322
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,110
Oh, bingo!

323
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:27,230
Wow. Even yoga. Looking at her, there's really nothing she can't do.

324
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,980
♫ If you think about it ♫

325
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,580

Ah. Then, Ji Hoon must be Gwang Jae and Bo Hee's son.

331
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,310
J2's Yoo Hyeon Jae is in the midst of a new scandal.

332
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,320
It's already his fourth scandal this year.

333
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,500
This time, the protagonist is Pure Fairy Hong Boo Hee.

334
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,540
Hey, man. Stop right there!

335
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,370
Where did they go?

336
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,370
Catch them!

337
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,170
- Stay here and don't go anywhere until people come.
- Okay, I understand.

338
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,090
I'm leaving.

339
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,300
- I'll wait for you.
- Yeah, okay.

340
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,640
Hey, where did they go?

341
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,660
Hey! They went over there! Stop right there!

♫ My trembling heart ♫

343

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:16,020
♫ It's written all over your face without expressing it ♫

347
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,410
Why are my insides in such a hurry?

348
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:25,820
Oh, sh*t! My stomach, my gosh!

349
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:32,470
I better hurry up.

350
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,120
Oh! A handphone.

351
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,290
What? She's done with it already?

352
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,930
Ah! What is that?

353
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,330
- Why are you so surprised about?
- Hyeon Jae...

354
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,250
What is it? You look like a person who has seen a ghost.

355
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,430
No. What ghost?

356
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,920
Were you looking through the telescope?

357
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,100
By any chance, don't tell me you were spying on someone?

358
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,500
Spying? What type of person do you take me for?

359
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,340
You know we're meeting a group of friends for dinner in the evening, right?

360
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,400
Yes, I heard about it. But, I have an important concept meeting with the team leaders tonight.

361
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,730
Oppa. Your clothes aren't great.

362
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,370
Change into these.

363
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,530
Then I'll just wear these clothes. It's not even an important dinner.

364
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,370
Do you want to get rid of those clothes? Or do you want to get rid of this?

365
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,970
Oppa. You always grumble first even though you end up doing what you're asked to eventually.

366
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,450
Cute.

367
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,830
Wow! Music comes out of it?

368
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,130
♫ After this night ♫

369
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:18,650
I don't know when I'll be back, but I'm going to take one of these things back with me at all costs.

370
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,240
Amazing.

371
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,500
Oh! It startled me.

372
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,610
What? My face is coming out of it.

373
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,970
What is this?

374
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,600
How do I do this?

375
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:54,500
♫ My trembling heart makes my heart flutter ♫

376
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,740
Why is this here?

377
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,460
That's strange.

378
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,800
D-1

379
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:31,920
Boss. I'm sorry to ask you this but my test is tomorrow. Can I take the day off today?

380
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,440
I could close the store for one day. But, I make a living day by day.

381
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,870
Please understand my situation.

382
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,980
Again, again. Do it again by yourself.

383
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,920
Again. That's not the right feeling.

384
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,400
Bring the feeling back to life. Again.

385
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,610
That's not the right feeling. Feel! Feel!

386
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,000
Again. It's not the right feeling.

387
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,210
Again. Bigger moves.

388
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,670
What's she doing?

389
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,860
Hey!

390
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,130
- Hey! What are you doing? Really!
- What's wrong with you?

391
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,270
- Move! Aren't you moving?
- Hey, I won't! I can't!

392
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,970
You! You were also trying to die before?

393
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,470
- Right? No wonder!
- It's you again?!

394
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,520
You have to live. I thought you were strong, Intense Hye Ri. Is this all you have and you'll give up?

395
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,940
I was in the middle of stretching.

396
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,770
Let go of me!

397
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,450
- Then, what about this string?
- Don't you know flying yoga?

398
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,190
- It was around your neck.
- I was in the middle of doing yoga, you idiot!

399
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,500
And this is a girls-only practice room.

400
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,080
- Can you please get out?
- Yes.

401
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,730
By the way...

402
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,210
- I'm a senior.
- Get out.

403
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,130
He's funny. Who is helping whom?

404
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,740
Music Notes
The Best Yoo Hyeon Jae

405
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,790
What did he write in this part?

406
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,370
Ah, this punk. I like you as a composer but your writing is terrible. You were just scribbling all over your handwriting.

407
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,980
It's hard for someone who is stealing it.

408
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,750
I think this would be good as a hook.

409
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,830
- Yes. Please tell Ms. Carrie to come up.
- You mean Producer Carrie, right?

410
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,330
Then do you think I'd joke around asking for that toy girl, Carrie?

411
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,330
Aish. I already told you to fix the chair.

412
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:15,130
- The thing is that the part we need comes from Italy...
- Then send the chair to Italy.

The Best Yoo Hyeon Jae

414
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:38,460
Ah, yes. Maybe, it was because I care a lot about MJ that it stressed me out. I've started to hallucinate.

415
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,090
I want to have one.

416
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,740
I'll have it someday.

417
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,310
That's it!

418
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,340
Ah. I'm really starving to death. Why aren't' those guys coming home?

419
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,930
Ah. The great Hyeon Jae is turning to a coin piggy bank.

420
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,980
No, no.

421
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,510
I don't know about anything else, but I can't fall behind in fashion.

422
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,640
Yoo Hyeon Jae is wearing clothes that are 20 years behind the trend? Does it make sense?

423
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,380
Ah. What do we have here? Let's see.

424
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,290
This is just too much.

425
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,500
This is definitely great.

426
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:31,410
My gosh. How can it be so clean and puffy?

427
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,650
To have this kind of skin at this age, it's great.

428
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,730
Then, let's see.

429

What is this?

430
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,560
When did I have a picture like this?

431
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,030
Hyeon Jae?
