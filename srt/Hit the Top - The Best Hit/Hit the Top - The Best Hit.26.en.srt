00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,480
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,300
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,290
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,670
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,000
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,420
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,100
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,080
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,250
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,410
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,970
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,010
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,060
Choi Woo Seung

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,180
Lee Ji Hoon!

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,440
Is it because you're an intern? You finished work early.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,620
It ended early only today.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,020
- But did you wait for me?
- Yeah.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,470
- For you to keep your promise.
- Promise?

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,560
You said you'd see a movie with me. I found a movie that I want to see.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,300
So you're joining your dad's company?

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,420
I thought it would be better than in other places.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,050
My father is taking a break now, but he was a very famous manager once.

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,120
Well, I heard that he was great when he was J2's manager.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,670
What?

25
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,590
Come to think of it, it's been a while since I saw you like this.

26
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,560
There you go again at making me get goosebumps.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,650
It's okay if it's like this sometimes!

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,430
Well, it does seem like it's been a while since we laughed together like this.

29
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,820
You're going to eat popcorn, right?

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,390
Caramel-flavored popcorn with Sprite.

31
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,960
Friend, you seem to know me better than I know myself sometimes.

32
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,980
- Let's go together.
- No, you already bought the tickets.

33
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,150
I'll be back soon. You can sit down.

34
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,420
The last scene was really awesome, right? How did they come up with such a story?

35
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,280
As expected, movies with good audience reviews are also really fun.

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,060
Right?

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,690
This is about Thumbs Up.

38
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,370
What do you think of him?

40
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,080
Do you like him?

41
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,080
I don't really kno—

42
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,490
It does seem like that.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,020
How would it be if we hadn't been friends from the start?

44
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,520
What?

45
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,470
What if we hadn't met as childhood friends but met just like you and Thumbs Up?

46
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:21,170
In the midst of a series of strange coincidences and unusual situations... like a movie.

47
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,940
If we met like that, would our relationship be different?

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,900
♫ After a long night passes ♫

49
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,010
♫  And tomorrow comes ♫

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,870
The fact that I met you as a friend

51
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,020
♫ Will I be closer to my dream? ♫

52
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,950
is something I regret now.

53
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,680
♫  Or will I be frozen like my clock? ♫

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,840
♫ Light in the sky ♫

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,140
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

56
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,150
♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

57
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,560
♫  Some day, fly fly fly ♫

58
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,310
World Entertainment

59
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,320
Logistics Center
Daily work Journal

60
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,430
- You drink a large-sized iced caramel macchiato with two shots, right?
- Ah, geez.

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,450
Hey, why are you more like a person here than me?

62
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,350
I always put in my best effort no matter whatever it is or wherever I am.

63
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,920
You never put in any effort at all.

64
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,640
Is everything going well?

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,530
The investments are almost confirmed.

66
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,460
Who are you supposed to get them from?

67
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,370
Half of it will be from Chairwoman Kathy, and the other half will be from Chairwoman Oh from Jongno.

68
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,350
If it's Chairwoman Kathy, is she the Kathy we know? Are you sure it'll be okay?

69
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,900
I'm in the middle of looking into everything right now, don't worry.

70
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,940
So does this mean you've overcome the biggest problem and you're over the hump?

71
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,270
But, music is the most important.

72
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,200
You already overcame that the moment you asked me for a song.

73
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,250
- So, when do you think the song will be ready?
- It's almost finished.

74
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,530
- It'll be great, right?
- It'll be great for sure!

75
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,480
Who do you think the song I wrote will take after? It'll be smooth because it'll take after me.

76
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,040
Right. By any chance, did you ask Yeong Jae to pay off our debt?

77
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,450
It's me, Hyeon Jae. Have you ever seen me ask anyone for something? I demanded it.

78
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,180
You did something useless.

79
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,560
Why was it useless? If you think about it, isn't it all our money?

80
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,720
How is that our money, it's Yeong Jae's.

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,810
There's something you don't know, but it's okay.

82
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,870
Yeong Jae can still give us more than what he gave.

83
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,200
How do you always make things so simple?

84
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,380
What if it's complicated?

85
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,700
Did you decide to have Ji Hoon debut after all?

86
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,130
I'm going to try it once.

87
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,860
If that happens, then both Ji Hoon and I would debut under you.

88
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,730
One of them was the biggest mistake of my life.

89
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,110
And the other one will be the biggest hit of my life.

90
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,300
Listen to yourself.

91
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,100
By the way, this is about me. No matter how much I think about it,

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,670
I think there's only one person associated with my disappearance.

93
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,240
The one who got the best profit after I disappeared.

94
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,370
Who is that?

95
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,910
No way!

96
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,460
Not that, but Park Yeong Jae.

97
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,390
I got it, so
CEO Park Yeong Jae

98
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,300
- please contact Chairwoman Oh.
- Yes.

99
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,570
Hey, honey. I heard you agreed to invest in Gwang Jae's company.

100
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,670
You can't do that.

101
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,060
Do you know how hard things are for the company?

102
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,430
In a bit, it'll cost you a lot of money to renew MJ's contract with us.

103
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,150
I'm going to tell him that it won't be possible. Do you understand?

104
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,260
I got it. I'll forget about Bo Hee and I'll pretend that didn't happen.

105
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,810
This means we are even. Okay?

106
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,850
Chairwoman Oh of Jongno is on the line.

107
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,950
Aigoo, Chairwoman. I haven't been in touch with you for a while, have I?

108
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,050
Aigoo. I'm calling you because I have a great investment opportunity for you.

109
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm only telling this to Chairwoman and no one else.

110
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,390
This time we are going to release MJ's album in collaboration with an American company.

111
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,620
Is your investment in World Entertainment confirmed?

112
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,650
If it's not confirmed, why don't you join us?

113
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,530
Of course.

114
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,890
Thumbs Up.

115
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,020
There's no one but you?

116
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,520
It seems like it. Why? Who did you come to see?

117
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,380
- Producer Yoon asked me to bring this.
- I see.

118
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,990
Okay then.

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,950
Right, Part-timer. You said you were in a band, right?

120
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,800
Oh, it was really ages ago and only for a short while.

121
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,420
Then that means you know how to read music.

122
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,690
Can you sing the guide track for me?

123
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,700
Hey. Do you want me to?

124
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,200
Can you do it for me? It's in women's key, so it's too high for me.

125
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,490
Hey. No, no, no way.

126
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,770
No, no.

127
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,230
You can wear headphones from there.

128
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,100
- These ones?
- Put those on.

129
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,580
Hey, Part-timer. You really look like a singer now.

130
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,120
Don't tease me.

131
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,590
Can you hear the instrumental accompaniment?

132
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,930
- What?
- Put those back on. Put them back.

133
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,970
What did you say?

134
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,590
Don't be nervous, just relax.

135
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,940
Who is nervous?

136
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,920
But, does an intern have to do this?

137
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,280
Okay, let's start.

138
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:58,500
♫ This feeling is a little awkward ♫

139
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:06,020
♫ Like a secret to tell you ♫

140
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:13,200
♫ I don’t know about love ♫

141
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:21,210
♫ But I feel fluttery about you ♫

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:30,860
♫ I have not told you yet ♫

143
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:40,300
♫ My lips tremble making me nervous ♫

144
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,960
This song... I wrote while thinking about you.

145
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
What?

146
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,600
I thought about you while writing this song.

147
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,950
What did you say? Can you say it again?

148
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,050
I wrote this song thinking about you.

149
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,480
Thinking about you.

150
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,900
♫ If you ♫

151
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,740
♫  If you come to me ♫

152
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,120
♫  I’ll feel like I have the world ♫

153
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,560
♫ I’m shouting to the sky ♫

154
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,530
♫  It’s only you ♫

155
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,400
♫ I’m closing my eyes, with all my heart ♫

156
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,330
♫  I’m calling out to you ♫

157
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,220
♫ I love you, I really want you ♫

158
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,350
- Goodbye.
- Yes, goodbye.

159
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,460
♫  Are you listening? ♫

160
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,570
Bro.

161
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,290
What are you doing here?

162
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,390
How did you know I was here?

163
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,760
Did you get a job?

164
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,630
No. It's just a part-time job.

165
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,060
What about the company?

166
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,770
You aren't there anymore, so I don't have any reason to be in the company. I have no regrets, so I also quit.

167
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,760
So what is it? Tell me honestly.

168
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,290
Bro. They kicked me out.

169
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,740
I did my best...

170
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,590
You did a good job. You did well.

171
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,910
Bro.

172
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,960
Okay.

173
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,230
Lee Ji Hoon | World Entertainment

174
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:07,210
This much, I think it's great.

175
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,650
Why am I so awesome?

176
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,630
I'm hungry.

177
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,790
Lee Ji Hoon

178
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,870
World Entertainment

179
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,370
I'm hungry.

180
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,670
World Entertainment

181
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:47,500
World Entertainment

182
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,360
Here it is.

183
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,620
Is this the song that the general manager has been working on?

184
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Yes.

185
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,680
I'm sure because I swapped it with the original one.

186
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,240
Then, let our guys tweak it a little bit and work with this one.

187
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,210
It'll be MJ's title song.

188
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,730
But, can we do that?

189
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,950
We'll release the song first,

190
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,260
and both our company and the singers are much bigger.

191
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,960
If they released it later, who would people think has copied it?

192
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,890
Also, they'll probably have a hard time getting the money to produce an album.

193
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,000
But still, how can you do this all of a sudden?

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,190
Someone I know told me there was a position available here.

195
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,130
Even though the work is hard, I get paid well.

196
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,580
Why did the company let you go all of a sudden?

197
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,930
There is the age problem, so I guess I'm useless to them now.

198
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,620
While working part-time like this, whenever I get a chance, I'll also go up and perform on a stage.

199
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,790
Do you believe in me?

200
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,770
Bro, of course.

201
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,630
Then, let's try one more time. With me.

202
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,990
Where? Did Ssen Entertainment contact you?

203
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,180
- Not at Ssen Entertainment.
- If it's not Ssen Entertainment then a better place?

204
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,780
At World Entertainment.

205
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,740
If it's World Entertainment... Do you mean your dad's company? Helter-Skelter's company?

206
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,250
Never mind. Trust me.

207
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,990
- Instead, you can't lie to me anymore.
- Hey.

208
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,760
Why would I lie to you? What do you take me for?

209
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,580
Salute!

210
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,650
Marine Lee, it's nice meeting you here.

211
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,570
Pardon? I think you got the wrong person.

212
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,760
I accidentally bumped into Marine Oh. He said he would buy me a cup of coffee.

213
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,730
He just went to the bathroom. There he comes.

214
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,370
Salute!

215
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,050
Salute. Marine Lee, do you live near here?

216
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,010
Yes. That's right!

217
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,220
You're with your friend now. Just relax.

218
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,570
- Yes.
- How have you been?

219
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,010
Once a marine,

220
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,870
always a marine!

221
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,910
Yes!

222
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,260
- I'm going now.
- Yes.

223
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,220
Marines never die.

224
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,490
It's just that marines do not return.

225
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:37,030
Last summer, I went to the Marine Corps camp for a while. There I met, wow...

226
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,670
Have you been lying to me about your age?

227
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,030
Bro.

228
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,890
When did you do your military service?

229
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,420
You're amazing. You are definitely amazing. I can't believe this.

230
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,330
Sorry.

231
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,280
Woo Seung, have you decided? Are you really going to move into the room?

232
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,790
Pardon? Yes.

233
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,090
They say the sooner you go there, the better. What are you going to do?

234
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,230
World Entertainment

235
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,350
What's all this?

236
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,230
Let's have a get-together today.

237
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,640
A get-together dinner? What company are we? That we're having a get-together?

238
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,920
Did you prepare all this by yourself?

239
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,460
It's been a while since I last showed my skills so I thought I'd treat you.

240
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,970
I thought I was going to faint from hunger, but this is all good.

241
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

242
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,610
It's delicious. It's all good.

243
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,020
- You want to die? You want to die?
- Give it to me.

244
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,790
Really.

245
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,900
Have some meat.

246
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,750
It is healthy to eat a lot of garlic.

247
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,820
The loser will eat this.

248
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,700
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

249
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,150
That smells.

250
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,770
It's too hot.

251
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,410
I love this so much.

252
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,170
Someday...

253
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,340
You'll remember tonight as a long time ago, right?

254
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,330
I think you're right.

255
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,410
Why is everyone suddenly so serious while eating delicious food?

256
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,960
Shall we take pictures together?

257
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,580
- Pictures?
- Just to remember the night.

258
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,600
Sure then.

259
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,920
Here I go.

260
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,460
- Hurry, hurry up!
- Hurry, hurry up!

261
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,900
Quickly, legs up.

262
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,590
Here!

263
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,780
- Power Rangers!
- Power Rangers!

264
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,780
Hurry, hurry up! Hurry, hurry up!

265
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,250
What are you doing? Aren't you going to bed?

266
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,130
I need to sleep...

267
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,530
But, there is something I need to confess to you.

268
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,350
What?

269
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:29,350
Tomorrow, I'm moving out.

270
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,710
So that's why I'm saying goodbye to my beloved hammock.

271
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,800
I really thought I was going to be kicked on the streets,

272
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,110
But... Thanks to my friend, I've been well.

273
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,480
- Is it because of me?
- Yes.

274
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,570
It's because of you.

275
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm sorry I've been feeling beholden to you.

276
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,940
I don't care if you stay longer.

277
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,740
I know. But I found a room on good terms and at a great price.

278
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,970
Hey, I'll finally get paid soon.

279
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,190
Are you going far?

280
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,550
No. It's near here.

281
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,460
Is that so? Then I'll help you move your things tomorrow.

282
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,160
There isn't anything to move. I only have one bag.

283
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,790
Thank you for everything.

284
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,420
Lee Ji Hoon.

285
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,620
Come back anytime.

286
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,010
What do you think? How is it?

287
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,940
Is it tacky?

288
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,240
Not at all

289
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,560
Hey, I assure you, this is good enough to make it big.

290
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,230
Anyway, I was also worried about what to do if you didn't like it.

291
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,410
Hey, I think we should be able to get investments for this song and make an album.

292
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,630
Tell me if you need anything more. Don't get upset this time.

293
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,430
When did I get upset?

294
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:33,070
I didn't know that after you disappeared from being upset at me, I would be so bored.

295
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,880
You were my only friend after all.

296
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,300
If the soundtrack is okay, buy me a triangle kimbap.

297
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,040
Anyway, you're still a weirdo.

298
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,410
You're still the same 20 years ago and even now.

299
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,830
- Let's go.
- Sure.

300
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,240
How do you feel about it?

301
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,080
The feeling is great.

302
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,530
Hey, look at that!

303
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Soon, after a little while, Ji Hoon will be like that too.

304
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,570
Who is that? He's handsome.

305
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:26,360
Anyway, Ji Hoon will also become like him soon.

306
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,350
Ever since you came here, this is the very first time I like you.

307
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,880
Do you want to eat another triangle Kimbap?

308
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,610
Are you going to buy me another one?

309
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,670
Go and get another one for free. I saw earlier it was two for one.

310
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,030
♫ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♫

311
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,950
♫ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♫

312
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,890
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♫

313
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,600
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♫

314
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,590
♫ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♫

315
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,220
♫ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♫

316
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,740
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♫

317
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,150
What are you doing?

318
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,010
Oh! It's amazing. What is it?

319
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,240
I'm printing out some pictures. It's nice to share them together.

320
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,380
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! ♫

321
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,470
♫ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♫

322
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,450
Star Punch Entertainment

323
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,410
Are you looking for someone?

324
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,610
No.

325
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,020
Excuse me, has the general producer gone somewhere?

326
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,870
I think he came only in the morning today and he left later.

327
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,930
Do you know where he went?

328
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,050
I don't know either. He left work for today.

329
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,060
My gosh!

330
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,980
This is amazing even if I keep looking at it.

331
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,490
I really look good in this one.

332
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,020
I look cute.

333
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,610
The person you're calling isn't available...

334
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,770
What's with you, Thumbs Up?

335
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,890
Since I moved, I was going to ask him to do some house cleaning together. Where did he go?

336
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,020
He's not answering his phone either.

337
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,770
I'm definitely sure I locked it when I left.

338
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,800
You damned thief!

339
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,140
Thumbs Up!

340
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,760
Are you okay?

341
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,810
What should I do?

342
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,840
Hey, why did you come in secretly?

343
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,880
You really slap me with a frying pan whenever you see me.

344
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,500
What brings you here?

345
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,750
I heard that you rented a house from a colleague so I asked where it is.

346
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,790
I wanted to come here early and do some cleaning for you.

347
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,530
What?

348
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,580
So, did you leave work early in order to come here to clean up?

349
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,220
Forget it. I'm not the kind of person who brags about doing things like this.

350
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,130
Well... I've really mopped the floor so many times.

351
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,130
The blinds were also a mess, so I re-installed them.

352
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,970
The mattress too.

353
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,600
The bathroom was so messy and dirty too.

354
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,170
If you go now, you'll see it's so clean that it'll shine brightly.

355
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,890
Thumbs Up, that was so kind of you.

356
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,480
What would you like me to do in return?

357
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,930
Can you cook for me?

358
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,190
Let's have dinner before you go.

359
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,760
It's been a while since I had a proper meal with rice.

360
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,440
What do you mean by a proper meal?

361
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,960
Still, it's been a long time since I had this kind of meal.

362
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,660
This is not my story, but the story of a guy I know.

363
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,790
His parents passed away early when he was young.

364
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:48,060
Originally, his parents had been always busy, but they died in a car accident when he was in middle school.

365
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,650
So he lived alone ever since.

366
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:56,890
Because of his hot temper, he had no friends. His only hobby was listening to music.

367
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,790
He just listened to music like crazy.

368
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,730
Back then, he didn't want to go to college and he only wanted to do something related to music.

369
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,320
So he went to an entertainment company.

370
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,580
The company was the closest to his house.

371
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,040
He lived the way he wanted.

372
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,890
But...

373
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,800
He was still lonely.

374
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,410
He was always alone.

375
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:36,120
He dated women easily. He broke up with them easily too.

376
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,450
And...

377
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,980
And I guess he did a lot of terrible things to the people around him.

378
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:55,150
So, is he still living like that?

379
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,000
He?

380
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,600
Fortunately, he isn't lonely anymore.

381
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,370
He also got to eat some warm meals.

382
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,330
Come and see me often. I can cook this much.

383
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,780
It's upsetting. Why would you say often?

384
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,990
What's there to be upset about?

385
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll come by without a break, so be prepared.

386
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,980
- With whose permission?
- My permission.

387
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,870
Part-timer, what is it?

388
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,970
It's nothing.

389
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,030
What is it?

390
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,620
I just feel happy these days.

391
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,590
You feel happy, so why?

392
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:53,250
I always had trouble coming right after something good happened.

393
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:00,860
I, Thumbs Up, used to be called Trouble-shooter Man. Don't worry about mood swings.

Hello. I left some books on the rooftop.

I see. Go up. The guys are there too.

408
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,600
I heard you're going to debut in World Entertainment.

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,080
- How did you know?
- What?

410
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,800
Well... I heard it from here and there.

411
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,420
Hey, I'm also a half-time employee at World Entertainment.

412

Anyway, good luck.

- What?

It's nothing.

I know you're Yoo Hyeon Jae.

418
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,560
But, I want to make one thing clear.

419
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,770
I only have one father and he's the CEO of World Entertainment.

420
