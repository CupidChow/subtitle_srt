00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,300
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,410
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,620
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,130
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,800
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,600
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,130
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,400
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,070
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,970
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,810
Anyway, she's always pretending to be doing something all alone,

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,200
but every day she is so clumsy and keeps spilling something over.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,480
Then you should stay here for a bit.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,670
Hey, you. What are you doing here, like this?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,770
Wow. Why did you drink so much?

18
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,610
Ah, what should I do?

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,320
Bo Hee?

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,750
Hey! You jerk!

21
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,670
You better let go of Bo Hee!

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,390
Gwang Jae. It's me, Yoo Hyeon Jae.

23
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,400
You don't believe this, right? Right, I can't believe this.

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,750
It's driving you crazy, right?

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,160
If I put myself in you shoes, I think I'd feel the same way.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,830
I didn't know when I saw you from afar, but from close up, you're old. You aged a lot.

27
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,390
Is the hair of your head okay? You were always so worried about losing hair because of your dad's baldness.

28
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,120
You used to eat black sesame seeds and get a massage for your scalp—

29
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,910
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,900
So... Tell me again who you are.

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,910
It's me, Yoo Hyeon Jae.

32
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,490
Hey, does that make sense?

33
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,520
It doesn't make sense. I know it makes no sense. But that's what just happened.

34
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:36,610
You're right, Gwang Jae. It's hard to believe but I'm back.

35
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,450
Ta-da!

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,900
You, why did you all of a sudden?

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,800
No matter how much I think about it, I can't believe you.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,280
Give me proof that you're the real Hyeon Jae.

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,440
How can I do that? I left my ID and everything back then.

40
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,860
Also, would you believe me if I showed you my ID in this situation? You wouldn't.

41
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,890
What's your name? Not Yoo Hyeon Jae. Your birth name. Your real name.

42
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,300
Bong Jae. Yoo Bong Jae.

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,140
No, no. If you search that on the internet, it comes out easily.

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,800
Right. Hyeon Jae, that name. When, where and who made that name for you?

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,770
That name... It was Chairman Soon who got it from a fortune-teller.

46
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,640
But, I didn't like it. So I changed it and ended up calling myself Yoo Hyeon Jae.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,720
Oh, I'm right. How many years have you been working with me and you don't even know it's me?

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,000
I knew it was you the moment I saw you.

49
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,860
You look straight into my eyes.

50
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,440
Please stop already! I said I'm Hyeon Jae.

51
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,870
You punk. If you're the real Hyeon Jae, you'll have a scar on your ankle right now.

52
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,390
When you were a kid, you stepped on a hot pot and you got a burn scar. It was a star-shaped scar...

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,470
Do you believe me now?

54
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,690
Then, you are the real one.

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,850
Right. It's me. I'm Hyeon Jae. Lee Hyeon Jae.

56
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,300
Come here.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,330
♫ Oh, no, no ♫

58
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,700
♫ After a long night passes ♫

59
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,910
I heard everything. But, you can't solve this problem by running away.

60
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,630
Gwang Jae.

61
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,310
Thank you for coming after me.

62
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,010
I thought I would leave without seeing your face. But, it's nice to see it.

63
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,260
Please send my greetings to Chairman. And when I get there—

64
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,190
Why are you running away? What did you do wrong to get away?!

65
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,800
You just liked someone.

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,980
Because people do like him and you just happened to like that person, is that something to run away for?

67
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,550
Everyone likes someone. That's what everyone does!

68
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,660
I don't know where Hyeon Jae disappeared to but forget him.

69
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,100
You can register Hyeon Jae's child as my son. I'll take responsibility.

70
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,420
And you can come back again!

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,560
How can I do that to you?

72
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,680
- How can you put that burden on you?
- Just do as I say!

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,400
From now on, I'll protect you. I'll do that.

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,060
If you want to run away and hide somewhere to avoid it, don't go anywhere else.

75
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,610
Just come to me.

76
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,200
If people condemn you, I'll deal with anyone who says anything!

77
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,780
- Why would you?
- Because I'm Hyeon Jae's manager.

78
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,350
Hyeon Jae's business is my business.

79
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,140
Whatever Hyeon Jae did, I'll take full responsibility for that.

80
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,630
From now on, I'll take Hyeon Jae's place instead.

81
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,050
♫ Light in the sky ♫

82
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,340
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

83
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,380
Right. It's me. I'm Hyeon Jae. Lee Hyeon Jae.

84
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,800
♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,410
Come here.

86
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,540
♫  Some day, fly fly fly ♫

87
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,910
I knew you were short-tempered, but how can you hit me so many times every time I say something?

88
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,900
So... To help me make sense of this nonsense, let's summarize it.

89
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,170
There was a typhoon, and you slid down your studio's stairs.

90
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,480
When you woke up, 20 years had passed. Is that so?

91
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,990
- That's right.
- That makes no sense at all!

92
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,600
No matter how absurd it may be, you should say something that makes it sound possible to some extent.

93
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,980
How do you think I feel when I say something that doesn't make sense?

94
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,250
You didn't just return from hiding somewhere else?

95
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,890
You just felt embarrassed to just return, so you made up a strange crap.

96
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,960
Am I that type of person?

97
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,600
You would do even more than that.

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,750
Then... The man Chairman saw the other day was...

99
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,400
Oh, that. I just happened to meet him on the rooftop. I was also really surprised.

100
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,220
So that means you've been near us?

101
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,340
Not near you, but above you to be exact.

102
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,400
Above?

103
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,600
I live on the rooftop in my old studio.

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,470
What? Then what about Ji Hoon?

105
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,620
Don't worry. Your son doesn't even know who I am.

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,600
Anyway, Lee Gwang Jae, I thought you were a cruel guy.

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,480
When did you and Bo Hee get together?

108
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,910
Bo Hee originally used to like me.

109
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,310
You, really!

110
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm Hyeon Jae. I won't get hit a third time.

111
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,810
Hey. Don't you know that the face is important to a celebrity? Why would you hit me in the face?

112
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,080
Now that I think about it, I'm a little sad.

113
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,820
Anyway, you're seeing me for the first time in nearly 20 years.

114
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,040
You met your friend after 20 years, aren't you happy to see me at all?

115
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,210
Do you think I would be happy to see you?

116
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,190
Is it because of the loan? I heard about the building.

117
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,330
Hey, so why would you leave and try so hard—

118
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,600
Be quiet. Don't you know it's all because of you?

119
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,300
What did I do? Right. I can understand why Chairman Soon Tae is a little upset at me.

120
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,590
So that's totally understandable. I think that's possible.

121
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,050
But, why are you so upset at me?

122
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,700
Forget it.

123
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,070
Like you said, let's just pretend you're the real Yoo Hyeon Jae.

124
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm not pretending—

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,610
Maybe you've been hiding somewhere for twenty hears and have just returned.

126
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,140
Or as you say, you slid down the stairs and jumped 20 years into the future.

127
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,810
I don't care whatever it is, but listen to me carefully. I have only one thing to say to you.

128
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,000
What is it?

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,620
- Get lost.
- What?

130
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,400
Don't disturb other people's lives who are already living well without you.

131
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,800
Just go back to where you came from quietly. Do you understand?!

132
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,140
Hey, what do you mean...

133
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,470
Ah, you really! How can I go back?

134
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,130
I don't even know who I got here.

135
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,600
That jerk, why is he so mean to me?

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,520
Ah, that reminds me that I have to pick something. The bag.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,270
Thumbs Up! Why are you back so late?

138
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,700
It was you, Lee Ji Hoon?

139
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,440
Why? You look disappointed to see me.

140
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,140
What disappointment?

141
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,520
By the way, did something happen earlier?

142
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,390
That's a long story to tell. Wait!

143
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,520
Lee Ji Hoon, it doesn't suit you, but were you worried about me by any chance?

144
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,700
Why would I be worried? That's not it.

145
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,600
Then, where are you coming from?

146
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,320
By any chance, are you dating behind my back?

147
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,550
What about dating? Can't I go on a date?

148
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,600
Yes. Sure, you can.

149
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,930
- Are you really dating someone?
- I...

150
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,240
Hey. How many times do I have to go back and forth? Here.

151
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,800
- Are you making a bag or what? What took you so long?
- Hey.

152
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,700
Why is your face like that?

153
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,160
I had a little business to take care of.

154
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,080
Where did you roll down?

155
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,550
Rolled down what? I said I had a little business to take care of.

156
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,710
You just came in too? You're late?

157
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,860
Why do you care?

158
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,100
Like father, like son. Why are they doing this to me?

159
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,050
The Best Hit

160
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,780
World Entertainment

161
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,180
Hey, hey, this. It looks delicious.

162
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,690
Hey, hey. Why do we only have the head? Where is its body?

163
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,810
It's fish head dark meat. It's said there are six flavors on the fish head.

164
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,100
Do you mean fish-heads and animal-tails?

165
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,820
Well, it means fish heads are delicious and animal tails are too, right?

166
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,330
Right. The head of a fish is... As long as you know what I mean, then it's fine.

167
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,110
Aigoo. Ah, this is delicious.

168
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,700
It's so refreshing and delicious.

169
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:52,020
Ajumma. The fish keeps staring at me.

170
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,370
That's right, you did well.

171
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,240
From early in the morning, there is no need to start your day with a staring contest against a fish.

172
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm going to fry an egg and eat it with some rice.

173
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,870
Grandpa, I want it too.

174
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,410
Ji Hoon, do you want one too?

175
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,340
- While you are at it, only if there is an extra egg.
- Okay.

176
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,370
Aigoo. The taste is just fine.

177
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,750
I think it's delicious. I like it.

178
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,200
The soup was so strange this morning, right?

179
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,920
What? No, it was delicious.

180
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,260
I only knew how to eat, but I've never cooked before.

181
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,680
I don't know what I did to get this old that I don't even know how to cook.

182
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,020
I told you it was delicious.

183
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:55,100
By the way, last night I had a dream that I was with Hyeon Jae.

184
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,070
What?

185
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,180
Aigoo. I think it's a dream. Does that make sense?

186
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,430
What?

187
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,400
No. Hyeon Jae said that he slid downstairs during a typhoon,

188
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,480
and after he woke up, he found out he came here 20 years later.

189
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,220
He said he came to where we're living.

190
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,920
That's a silly dream.

191
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,200
Right? It's a silly dream.

192
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,280
But, it didn't feel like a dream.

193
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,500
It was as if Hyeon Jae came back.

194
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,190
What?

195
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,280
Are you all going somewhere?

196
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,400
Don't you have the day off?

197
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,770
We aren't a jobless bum like you.

198
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,090
Hey, who is a jobless bum?

199
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,970
Hide until we come home. Don't get caught.

200
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,890
- Don't spill stuff.
- Leave.

201
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,420
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon. Will you be home late today?

202
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,160
I don't know.

203
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,140
That guy, seriously!

204
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,710
What's wrong with him since this morning?

205
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,050
Hey, why are you so tactless?

206
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,810
Ji Hoon isn't feeling like himself lately.

207
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,160
Isn't it because he failed to join the debut group? Why is he taking it out on me?

208
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,120
1,000,000 won

209
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,030
First of all, should I buy some clothes?

210
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,920
If I buy this and that, they could only cost 1000 won.

211
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,260
Should I get a room with the remaining money?

212
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,610
No, no. It's better to stay here for now.

213
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,140
I'll get a room later.
 Slowly.

214
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,170
Hey, I have to meet that jerk one more time.

215
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,720
Hey! Are you inside?

216
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,180
Ah... No need.

217
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,260
Yes. I'm here.

218
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,890
Just as I suspected, you're really Yoo Hyeon Jae.

219
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,540
Just accept the truth now, dude.

220
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,680
It doesn't feel good to hear someone much younger call me dude.

221
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,700
Your son thinks of me as a friend.

222
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,790
If he finds out I'm his dad's friend, he'll pass out.

223
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,880
But how come Ji Hoon doesn't look like you at all?

224
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,470
That's because...

225
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,020
Never mind. I don't want to talk about this with you.

226
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,960
So what are you going to do now? You can't stay here forever.

227
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,890
- There's no other way.
- There is another way.

228
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,340
You should try anything.

229
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,020
What should I do?

230
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,920
Let's go back to the past.

231
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,390
What?

232
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,090
Hey. I think this is only going to hurt.

233
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,300
I heard from you that you slid down the stairs and you ended up coming here.

234
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,820
If you do exactly the same, you might go back to the past?

235
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,060
- I think this is too stupid.
- Stupid?

236
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,670
Or are you going to live here like a beggar?

237
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,270
I have some money.

238
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,000
- What? Did you bring money with you?
- No, it's not like that.

239
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,270
Then, just go back, you punk.

240
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,300
That's the best choice for all of us.

241
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,890
We don't know what will happen, so let me say goodbye to the guys.

242
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,970
Just leave.

243
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,790
For the last time, let me eat one more triangle kimbap.

244
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,180
I said to leave.

245
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,130
I got it.

246
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,850
- At the count of three, push me down.
- Okay.

247
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,700
Here we go. One, two—

248
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,480
- Wait!
- What is it? What is it?

249
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,570
I didn't forget to take it with me.

250
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,640
Why are you taking your handphone with you? You can't use it there anyway.

251
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,420
Still.

252
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,350
You just do whatever you want. Okay, you checked it's there so put in back.

253
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,680
Okay, here we go.

254
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,230
Okay then.

255
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,530
- One, two—
- Wait!

256
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,880
What is it again? What is it this time?

257
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,960
Doesn't it look too dangerous? This seems too dangerous.

258
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,790
Three!

259
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,050
He left. He went back!

260
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,520
It's a success!

261
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,300
It's a failure.

262
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,060
You see? Didn't I tell you it wouldn't work?

263
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,050
Aish! I really almost died.

264
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,300
You see? Doesn't it look like I got a scratch on my arm on my way down?

265
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,300
- Try doing it again.
- What?

266
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,970
I said to try doing it again.

267
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,360
Gwang Jae.

268
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,970
Gwang Jae. Gwang Jae!

269
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,710
Gwang Jae.

270
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,050
No.

271
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,160
Gwang Jae.

272
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,930
Gwang Jae! Hey!

273
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,890
Gwang Jae. Let's stop here.

274
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,520
I said it hurts!

275
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,850
Gwang Jae.

276
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,940
I won't do it. I really can't do it anymore!

277
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,230
I can't! I won't!

278
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,260
No. What on earth did we do wrong?

279
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,720
I thought you were supposed to do that when you came back here.

280
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,180
Actually, it doesn't make sense to go back this way.

281
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,210
What are you talking about?

282
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,060
Come to think of it. What if I go back like this, I'm still going to disappear in a year?

283
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,160
Who made me disappear and why,

284
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,890
I need to find out about it all.

285
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,210
Find out what?

286
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,600
I think if there's a culprit behind all this...

287
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,240
What?

288
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,840
Do you have someone in mind?

289
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,910
- The culprit is you.
- What?

290
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,890
You know you're self-centered, you're the only one who knows what you're up to...

291
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,430
And whenever things gets complicated, you run away. Isn't it?

292
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,630
When did I ever run away...?

293
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:10,150
Hey! When you didn't show up for a live broadcast because you had to go to the bathroom,

294
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,050
- what did you do?
- I ran away.

295
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,510
What about your scandal with Song Mi So? When her male fans came to beat you?

296
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,430
- What did you do?
- I ran away.

297
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,080
Yes, you ran away.

298
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,290
To be honest, I wasn't curious when you went missing.

299
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,300
That's how you're originally supposed to be.

300
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,610
For our old friendship's sake, I'll let you stay at the rooftop for now.

301
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,580
But it's only for a while. I hope you leave my house soon.

302
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,780
Also, I believe everyone would naturally feel the same way.

303
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,940
I hope my family doesn't find out you are Hyeon Jae.

304
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,120
Especially, make sure Bo Hee doesn't see you.

305
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,940
If you get into trouble while you're hanging around the guys, I won't forgive you.

306
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,280
I'm going.

307
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,630
Are you crying?

308
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,040
I think my handphone got cracked while I was sliding down the stairs earlier.

309
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,680
You really just broke the remaining affection of our friendship with those words.

310
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,510
I'm going, you punk!

311
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,720
That rude little bastard.

312
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,340
You're the rude one.

313
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,210
No matter how many rude people are in the world nowadays,

314
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,600
iut I've never seen such a rude fellow like you. You're the ruder one!

315
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,600
No. How can you speak informally to someone who is already older than you?

316
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,300
Grandpa. I'm the same age as him.

317
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,790
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon!

318
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,350
This punk.

319
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,750
Hey!

320
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,850
Are you mad at me about something?

321
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,850
And why was your face all swollen in the morning?

322
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,360
- Hey, who are you?
- Who am I? I'm your noona!

323
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,530
What are you doing?

324
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,480
Huh?

325
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,440
What the heck are you doing?

326
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

327
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,220
Run!

328
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,990
Damn. What's wrong with her?

329
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,640
Some dude was parked weirdly. Did you wait very long?

330
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Hyung, you should care more about your job.

331
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,050
What kind of manager makes his celebrity wait so long in the middle of the street?

332
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,090
I always care about my job.

333
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,350
What's that notebook?

334
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,390
Do I have to tell you everything, too?

335
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,080
No, you don't have to.

336
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,710
Let's go.

337
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,800
Wow, this is so...

338
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,570
Choi Woo Seung (means "first place")?

339
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,550
What kind of a name is Woo Seung?

340
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,160
Then, would her younger sibling be called Joon Woo Seung (means "second place")?

341
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,600
How tacky. Funny, though.

342
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,050
I'm going to use that in the future.

343
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,910
MJ Hits Perfect All-Kill on Charts In Record Time

344
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,910
MJ participated in writing, composing, and producing "Come Back Again,"

345
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,360
the top-charting hit?

346
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,810
He looks normal on the outside but he's a total lying thief.

347
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,060
So, Yeong Jae is his CEO?

348
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,940
Wait. Then was it Yeong Jae who...

349
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,850
Hey. Tomorrow, don't forget.

350
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,260
What? What's tomorrow?

351
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,980
We decided to go to the bank together so you can pay me back.

352
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,620
Okay. I'll pay you back in double, so don't worry about it.

353
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,690
You said that last time, too. It's always double for you, isn't it?

354
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,780
Forget that. My part-time job fee, 51,760 won ($42.88), doubled is 103,520 won ($85.76).

355
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,830
Round-trip ticket for the subway was 5,000 won, plus 60,000 for the car fee, that's 168,520 ($142,000) won in total.

356
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,010
Don't break your promise.

357
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,640
"It adds up to 168,520 won. Don't break your promise."

358
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,340
Hi, honey, I just found the wallet. I'll be there soon. Okay.

359
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,430
Hey, you didn't leave yet?

360
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,850
No. Oh, but I was just about to.

361
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,160
Perfect. Can you make a list of all the people who entered my room last week?

362
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,570
What, everyone?

363
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,250
Why do you keep checking the security footage?

364
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,390
- Well, I was just curious.
- Sorry?

365
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,930
Oh, and you know the big convenience store across the street from us?

366
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,570
Yes.

367
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,040
Look into the part-timer who works the night shift part-time.

368
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,980
Wait, if she's a part-timer, do I have to add that she works part-time?

369
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,310
Anyway, her name, age, contact information, everything.

370
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,680
What?

371
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:20,090
Customer, this check was issued by Joowan Bank, so it may be hard to cash.

372
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,380
Why?

373
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,500
It's a check from a bankrupted bank and the depositor protection period is now over.

374
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,670
Wait, Joowan Bank went bankrupt?

375
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,400
Why? That bank was one of the best.

376
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,950
They even opened foreign branches all over the world.

377
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,760
Yes, but they went bankrupt during the IMF crisis.

378
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,510
I can't believe this.

379
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,580
What's the IMF crisis?

380
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,020
What is it?

381
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,950
You don't know what that is?

382
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,970
IMF?

383
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,770
I... am... F?

384
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,190
Your life is an F.

385
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,650
You've been talking big this whole time with a check from a bankrupt bank?

386
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,380
This can be considered bank fraud!

387
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,040
How are you going to pay me back?

388
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,210
Damn it!

389
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,240
These are mere pieces of paper now.

390
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
Dda Bong!

391
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
What are you going to do now?

392
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,050
Going to do about what?

393
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,930
Are you joking?

394
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,710
If I cannot reimburse Choi Woo Seung by Monday, I will leave the rooftop apartment with no complaints. Happy?

395
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,350
Is that good?

396
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,040
I'll pay you back.

397
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,540
When? How? What will you do?

398
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,280
I don't know.

399
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,790
I just will, some way.

400
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,340
Why can't you just trust people?

401
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,260
I can trust people, but I can't trust money.

402
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,310
Thumbs Up

403
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,040
Read.

404
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,100
- I, Thumbs Up—
- I can't hear you.

405
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,690
I, Thumbs Up, will repay Choi Woo Seung the 160,000 won (~ $133)—

406
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,770
168,520 won (~ $140)!

407
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:26,260
The 168,520 won I owe her, and if I can't, for the rest of my life...

408
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,090
Damn it.

409
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,850
I will become her slave with no rights

410
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,380
and do as she says for the rest of my life.

411
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,090
Are you happy now?

412
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,430
Don't you dare not pay me back. I'm going to sell you off at a slave auction.

413
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,950
You must not know who I am—

414
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,270
Shut up. I don't care who you are, so just pay me back.

415
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,300
Okay, Thumbs Up?

416
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,580
I will repay it, I will! You're humiliating me.

417
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,510
When the guys who were going to debut took their stuff out of their lockers,

418
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,310
I thought my soul was going to go with them.

419
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,670
Bro, I can't tell if I'm eating with my mouth or my nose.

420
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,170
Bro, it's going into your mouth really well.

421
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,080
So what are you two going to do?

422
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,670
In the future?

423
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:31,030
Since a boy group is going to debut soon, there won't be another one for two or three years.

424
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:35,360
Then, you guys will be older and have to worry about military enlistment. What will you do?

425
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,280
That's true.

426
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,570
- So, will you give up?
- What?

427
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,320
Are you guys going to quit?

428
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,210
No, we haven't thought about that yet.

429
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,660
Alright then.

430
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,680
Are you going to finish your sausage?

431
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,430
- No.
- Then let me take one.

432
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,700
Why aren't you eating it?

433
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,900
I can't eat it, I just want to look at it.

434
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,510
Bro, how long have you been close to Poison Hye Ri?

435
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,370
I'm surprised, too.

436
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,060
Why are you surprised?

437
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,280
Huh?

438
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,130
Just eat. I don't bite.

439
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,340
I just didn't want to eat alone today.

440
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,940
Bro, I'm scared.

441
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,310
I think I'm going to get indigestion.

442
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,020
Me, too.

443
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,070
What's that noise?

444
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,340
22198

445
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,270
Bus from Mapo-gu to Seogyo-dong

446
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,150
What does 22198 mean?

447
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,720
It's not a phone number.

448
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,870
This is frustrating.

449
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:59,290
Yoo Hyeon Jae

450
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,120
Huh? Is it because I hit it before? Why is it turning off so quickly?

451
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,220
How does this work?

452
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,700
Thumbs up!

453
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,600
The internet...

454
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,970
Okay.

455
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,270
Wow, Yoo Hyeon Jae, you're amazing.

456
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,430
Yoo Hyeon Jae.

457
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,800
What's this? "Questions About Yoo Hyeon Jae's Disappearance"?

458
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,680
What's that?

459
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,040
What is the one food that Yoo Hyeon Jae could never eat?

460
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,680
What do you mean, something I'd never eat?

461
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,640
There is none.

462
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,090
You are not Yoo Hyeon Jae's fan.

463
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,150
I am Yoo Hyeon Jae.

464
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,390
I eat everything.

465
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,520
Ddomyangggong (not a real word)

466
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,280
You are not Yoo Hyeon Jae's fan.

467
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,090
Huh? Let me think.

468
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,070
Sweet and sour pork

469
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,630
You are not Yoo Hyeon Jae's fan.

470
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,440
Damn it.

471
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,220
Five spice sliced steamed pork
You are not Yoo Hyeon Jae's fan.

472
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,080
What is it?

473
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,210
You are not Yoo Hyeon Jae's fan.

474
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,370
This is annoying.

475
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,320
Delicious bread

476
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,160
What is this?

477
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,150
I'm hungry. Bring a lot.

478
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,630
Get inside.

479
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,150
We just have to move this inside?

480
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,090
Huh? No, you can go in. I'll do it on my own.

481
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,110
I can handle this much.

482
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,350
Get inside!

483
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,680
- Then, could you?
- Whoa, hey!

484
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,040
This is really pizza bread.

485
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,800
Can you bring me a few more of these later?

486
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,060
Buy it yourself.

487
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,590
This punk takes everything free.

488
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,720
Maybe that's why I'm in this miserable condition. Why am I so hungry lately?

489
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,320
Oh, right. I've been thinking.

490
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:22,060
I think the heavens sent me to the future to reveal the truth about my disappearance.

491
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,030
Does it make sense that a well-off person like me would just disappear?

492
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,950
- You did a lot of things that didn't make sense.
- Like what?

493
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,250
Oh, right. Do you still keep in touch with Yeong Jae?

494
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,730
I see him every now and then.

495
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,210
It looks like he really hit it big.

496
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,180
Hit it big, my foot. He was just lucky.

497
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:49,930
I guess. Honestly, I always thought you would be big like Yeong Jae is now.

498
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,770
I thought he would be living precariously like you are now.

499
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,290
But it's the total opposite.

500
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,690
Should I take the food back?

501
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,980
Anyway, I really want to see him. There's something I need to ask him, too.

502
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,210
Do you think you could pull some strings?

503
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,690
Forget it. I told you not to cause any trouble.

504
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,140
Trouble?

505
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,500
Also, is there something I can't eat?

506
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,630
What?
- A food I can't eat.

507
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,090
You should know that. How would I know?

508
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,630
- You were my manager.
- Well, I don't know.

509
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,570
Hey, from now one, don't call me up just to talk about this kind of stuff.

510
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,230
I'm busy enough without you interfering.

511
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,600
Is someone in there?

512
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,290
Damn it.

513
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,760
You can't hide together with me.

514
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,280
Hey, pick one. Hide or don't hide?

515
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,750
- You hide.
- No, you hide.

516
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,870
Get in there.

517
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,600
That's strange. I definitely heard someone talking.

518
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,970
What's this bread doing here?

519
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,240
Oh, man.

520
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,560
Hey, look what you got me into.

521
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,790
It would've been fine if you hadn't hid.

522
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,140
I need to pee.

523
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,500
Hold it.

524
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,750
I can't.

525
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:30,800
You're just like the building owner. Completely useless.

526
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,870
- It's too cramped.
- Don't touch me!

527
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,920
There's no space.

528
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,570
The Best Hit

529
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,330
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
