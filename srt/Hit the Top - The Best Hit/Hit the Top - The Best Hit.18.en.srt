Part-time job app

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,890
I don't think I'm going to last long as an intern there.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,930
Oh. The manager seems to be good.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,480
I guess they're very close like a real family.

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,680
Aigoo. We are completely different at our company.

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,230
What are you muttering to yourself?

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,400
Where did you get this?

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,290
Drill hid it secretly so that he could drink it alone, but I found it.

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,730
It seems like Ji Hoon does like you a lot.

23
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,390
I also like Ji Hoon but as a friend.

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,810
Men and women can't be friends. If you like someone, then you just like that person.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,830
It must be nice to be simple-minded.

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,850
What's the big deal? What's so complicated?

27
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,370
It's because you guys are making it complicated.

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,040
I don't understand this. Why Ji Hoon is suddenly acting this way?

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,840
And it's weird that you're rejecting him with an absolute cold shoulder.

30
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,680
All I have left by my side is... Ji Hoon.

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,310
What?

32
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,590
There's nobody else except him by my side.

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,560
I don't want to date Ji Hoon and end up losing him in the end too.

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,520
♫ Will I be closer to my dream? ♫

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,450
Thumbs Up. You should go home soon.

38
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,280
What?

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,440
I have told you so many things already.

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,240
No. Why would I be hurt? I'm not hurt at all.

46
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,630
Are you leaving just now?

47
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,260
What?

48
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,820
It's because they said I could come a little late today.

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,090
- Right. This is for you.
- What is it?

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,440
This is something I've treasured till now. I never used it even once. You can have it.

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,730
Why are you giving this to me?

52
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,590
You know. I got fired from all my part-time jobs.

53
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,980
I have no money to pay you for the rent now.

54
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,810
When I pay you the rent later, you can give it back to me.

55
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,940
- Forget it. Just pay me later.
- No.

56
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,240
I want to make it clear in times like this.

57
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,980
Take it quickly.

58
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,560
Okay then.

59
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,300
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking if it works.

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,490
It works well, right?

61
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,890
You look better than in real life.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm leaving.

63
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,470
You. Can't you just do what I say?

64
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,190
Ah. I told you I don't want to.

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,610
Ah, I'm saying this from my experience in life. Apologizing is not a big deal.

66
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,190
All you have to say is, "I'm sorry." If you say that one sentence, they will help us out.

67
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,200
What's so important about your pride?

68
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,930
I'd rather take a private loan. I don't want to borrow even one dollar from Yeong Jae at all!

69
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,010
Ah, this idiot. He says he wants to lend us the money.

70
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,880
I'm saying I don't want to!

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,080
Hey! Hey, hey you punk.

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,570
Okay then. Use a private loan.

73
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,790
You can use a private loan instead.

74
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,170
Aigoo. You punk are so stubborn...

75
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,920
Do you think I can't be stubborn?

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,760
Aigoo, seriously.

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,040
Where are you going?

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm going to take out a private loan. Why?

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,870
Why?

80
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,810
What's wrong with him again?

81
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,600
Aigoo.

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,640
Aigoo. I'm upset. So upset.

83
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,950
Gwang Jae, that punk. What's he really trying to figure out to do?

84
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:42,060
Right. He'll come back to his senses when we all get forced to live on the streets together.

85
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,020
That's right, you idiots.

86
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,120
Aigoo, I'm frustrated. I'm so frustrated.

87
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,820
Anyway, I'm the only one frustrated here.

88
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,770
The only frustrated one.

89
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,560
Aigoo. My legs hurt.

90
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,720
My legs.

91
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,390
What is this?

92
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,930
Who put this thing up here?

93
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,630
Should I sit down in it?

94
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,750
It's fun.

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,450
Aigoo.

96
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,180
Aigoo, this is comfortable. It feels good.

97
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,470
- It's really up to you.
- Hiking?

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,300
It's not mandatory, so it's up to you to join.

99
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,130
Is everyone else going, right?

100
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,770
That's true but don't feel burdened.

101
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,550
But, we never think of our interns as inferiors.

102
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,890
But, I heard all the other interns will be going.

103
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,960
I see.

104
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,980
Yes, I understand.

105
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,660
Grandpa!

106
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,100
Grandpa!

107
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,960
Grandpa, isn't it hot?

108
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,220
What? Yes.

109
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,020
Aigoo. I completely forgot to...

110
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,010
Aigoo. I slept like a baby in it.

111
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,320
Awesome.

112
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,800
What?

113
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,560
What is it?

114
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,500
CEO Park Yeong Jae

115
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,410
Bring some tea. You know the one I brought from the UK.

116
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,460
The one the Royal Family gave to me.

117
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,160
The one we're only giving small portions to the VIPs.

118
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,580
The Royal British Breakfast VIP tea.

119
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,820
You've already finished it.

120
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,090
What then?

121
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,420
- We have oolong tea
- What oolong?

122
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,630
Then, bring two cups of oolong tea.

123
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,550
Are you okay with oolong tea?

124
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,430
Yes, of course. It doesn't matter to me.

125
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,640
But, what brings you here?

126
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,590
Yeong Jae, you are awesome.

127
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,940
I knew you were doing well, but it feels different when I see it myself.

128
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,500
Ah, right.

129
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,400
To be honest, I am a little better than what people might hear about me at first glance.

130
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,630
So that's why I want to ask you a favor.

131
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,950
A favor?

132
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:01,240
Well, we're having a hard time because of the bank loan we took for our building.

133
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,860
Can you let me borrow that money from you?

134
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,010
Well, that's a bit difficult.

135
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,560
Okay, then.

136
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,770
I'll just give it to you.

137
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,060
What?

138
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,990
What? What's this? It doesn't look good.

139
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,880
I have to officiate a wedding but how did my face get burned?

140
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,530
Even my eyelids got sunburnt too.

141
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,440
- I'm giving it to you as your advanced payment.
- Advanced payment?

142
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,550
You sign with my company, then I'll give you the money right away.

143
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,330
We'll have to write a separate contract with you.

144
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,460
But, this is our company's basic contract form. You can take your time to look at it.

145
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,970
Management Contract

146
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,420
What is it? Do you also have something on your mind?

147
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,930
Is there anyone without worries in the world?

148
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,050
What's your big concern?

149
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,050
Ah. It seems I like an oppa.

150
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,000
Why are you worried?

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,900
But, my oppa is so popular among the girls.

152
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,470
Ah, I see. It could be kind of a worry.

153
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,670
- Ahjumma, what is love?
- What?

154
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,520
This part here prickles as if I applied some kind of ointment.

155
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,820
It's oridinarily like that when you like someone.

156
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,300
Ajumma, do you also feel that way?

157
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,850
I'm not sure.

158
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,610
Sometimes that happens to me.

159
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,180
So I think that's why I have lost my appetite.

160
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,110
It's 22198 again.

161
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,220
1:20?

162
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:52,560
1:20 am.

163
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,150
World Entertainment

164
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,460
- All done?
- Yeah, all done.

165
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,130
Mal Sook, why do you sound so down today?

166
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,850
We're switching partners next week.

167
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,560
So? What's wrong with that?

168
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,050
Well...

169
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,590
Never mind. You wouldn't know even if I told you.

170
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,840
What is it, you brat?

171
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,260
So...

172
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,440
Never mind. You wouldn't know even if I told you, Grandpa.

173
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:40,670
What is it? Why do you think it's something I won't know even if you say it? What is it?

174
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,080
- Well...
- Tell me. What's that?

175
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,210
No, you wouldn't know even if I told you.

176
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,430
Mal Sook, just tell me. What is it?

177
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,610
Can I use your phone?

178
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,980
If I play games, I might decide to tell you.

179
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,880
My phone has nothing to do with this. Tell me.

180
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,580
If you tell me, I'll give it to you.

181
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,880
- Well...
- Yeah?

182
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,400
Well what?

183
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,880
What is it? What?

184
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,600
I'll just use the ajumma's phone.

185
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,320
Mal Sook! What is it?

186
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,360
Ajumma? Can I play a game on your phone?

187
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,710
Can you unlock it for me?

188
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,490
Why? Your heart hurts again?

189
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,960
Yes, it really does.

190
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,180
Okay. Instead, you can only play once.

191
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,800
Okay!

192
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,450
Lift your butt.

193
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,000
Can you cooperate here?

194
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,040
Where are you going? It's the weekend.

195
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,770
To a place that's even scarier than "Train to Busan" (popular zombie movie). I'm going hiking.

196
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,120
Hiking? With your co-workers?

197
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,010
I'm already in deep water because of the text message incident, so I can't back out of it.

198
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,820
Life is tough as it is, why would we go hiking to make it worse?

199
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,190
- Should I go with you?
- No, thanks.

200
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,630
Bro, why are you acting so strange?

201
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Part-timer, you're wearing those shoes to go hiking?

202
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,790
Do you plan on slipping?

203
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,350
Buy me a pair of hiking boots, then.

204
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,150
If you think about it, this is all your fault.

205
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,270
You mountain climber idiot!

206

Bo Hee.

225
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,180
Exclusive Management Contract

226
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,850
Here you go. Enjoy!

227
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,230
Goodbye!

228
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,230
- Will you be eating here?
- Yes.

229
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,550
Is today a special bread-eating day or something?

230
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,440
Man, there are no seats.

231
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,630
Yo, all the part-timers are good-looking here.

232
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,850
Oppa, when does the other part-timer come?

233
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,900
I'm not sure. What time does he come?

234
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,140
It's time for you all to get a watch.

235
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,160
What the heck? That's an outdated joke.

236
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,810
What? What did you say?

237
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,310
My opinion of him just came crashing down.

238
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,770
Crashing down? Where?

239
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,590
Did something break?

240
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,730
What broke?
- Are you eating them here?
- Ah, yes.

241
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,110
Hello?

242
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,120
He picked up!

243
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,420
- Who is this?
- Oppa, you're not working today? 
- Who is this?

244
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm a fan.

245
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,090
What the heck?

246
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,450
What is this?

247
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,740
Oppa, you're so cool.

248
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm your fan.

249
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,840
Where are you?

250
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,460
Drill

251
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,070
Hello?

252
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,220
Bro! You hit the jackpot!

253
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,140
What are you talking about?

254
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,110
Someone posted a picture of you at your part-time job on Instagram.

255
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,170
That picture went viral.

256
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,080
You're nicknamed Part-timer Oppang (ppang means bread - Bread Oppa).

257
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,230
Part-timer Oppang?

258
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,750
It's supposed to mean part-timer oppa who works at a bread shop or something.

259
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,710
Anyway, you might receive texts from people you don't know.

260
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,640
I think your phone number was leaked, too.

261
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,210
What?

262
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,940
Let me hang up for now.

263
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,470
Who posted something like this?

264
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,680
Look, this is crazy.

265
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,160
This got popular faster than we expected.

266
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,150
Look at that. Have my senses ever failed us?

267
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,820
Wow, but this oppa's going to suffer for the next few days.

268
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,170
Wow, look at this.

269
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,200
Be careful as you come down, everyone!

270
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,030
This is why I didn't want to come.

271
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,720
- Oh, I'm so tired.
- Take just my hand.

272
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,260
- I'm going crazy.
- We're almost there.

273
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,660
Good job, everyone.

274
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,170
Be careful.

275
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,180
What happened? Are you okay?

276
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,560
Yes, I'm fine.

277
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,750
Are you hurt anywhere?

278
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,970
I just misstepped.

279
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,600
Should I help you?

280
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,120
No, it's alright. You can head down first.

281
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,250
I'll just take my time.

282
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,440
Alright, then.

283
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,530
What's this?

284
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,830
- What?
- Why would you meet with Yeong Jae?

285
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,790
Who told you to go over there to beg him on your knees?!

286
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,340
Did you have to make me look so miserable?

287
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,990
What? You met with Yeong Jae?

288
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,200
Gwang Jae, it's not because of you. It's because of me.

289
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,850
I'm switching companies.

290
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,190
- What?
- What?!

291
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:34,870
It's hard for me to release an album here. Yeong Jae said he can do it for me right away.

292
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,860
Yeong Jae, that punk. Did he just lure you into it like that?

293
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,440
That punk seriously!

294
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,320
Hey! Hey, Lee Gwang...

295
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,210
Lee Gwang Jae! What are you going to do?

296
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:52,550
Hey, that look... He always makes a big mess every time he has that look in his eyes.

297
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,790
Hey.

298
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,170
Star Punch Entertainment

299
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,570
- You can't just barge in as you please.
- Let it go!

300
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,030
What's really wrong with you? Hey, look here...

301
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,820
- What is it again?
- Hey, Park Yeong Jae!

302
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,900
What?

303
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,820
What is it again?

304
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,960
I'm a busy person. If you have anything to say, go ahead and talk to me quickly.

305
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,940
I'm begging you.

306
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,750
What? Is it about money again?

307
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,570
It's about Bo Hee.

308
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,210
Please take good care of her.

309
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,770
What?

310
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:16,180
As you already know, she deserves more than World Entertainment.

311
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,210
She has a lot of great musical talent

312
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,540
that she hasn't shown to the world yet.

313
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,250
Please help Bo Hee get back on her feet.

314
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,240
I'm begging you.

315
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,700
- Woo Seung, you aren't going with us.
- What?

316
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,610
Ah. Because my friend is coming to pick me up.

317
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,510
Okay then. See you Monday.

318
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,770
- Yes. Go home safely.
- Yes, we'll go first.

319
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,120
- See you later.
- See you later.

320
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,480
It hurts.

321
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,990
Slave Underdog

322
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,700
Thumbs Up

323
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,050
Calling Thumbs Up

324
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,960
Yes. What is it?

325
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,940
Ah, Thumbs Up!

326
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,500
I'm sorry, but can you come here for a while to pick me up?

327
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,030
Then I'll pretend you didn't owe me any debts.

328
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,520
Where is there?

329
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,370
A mountain.

330
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,180
A mountain?

331
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:04,260
Anyway, I knew this was going to happen when she left to hike a mountain wearing those lame sneakers.

332
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,300
No. This is a nice opportunity for Lee Ji Hoon. What an opportunity.

333
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,230
That's right. Your dad will back you up for sure.

334
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,330
Why isn't he answering my call?

335
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,470
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.

336
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,610
Woo Seung said she hurt her leg hiking in the mountains. Now she's alone so she needs someone to pick her up.

337
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,420
You go there right now.

338
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,480
Bro!

339
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,430
Why can't I get in touch with you?

340
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,750
I turned off my phone because I got too many prank calls.

341
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,550
The company would like to see you.

342
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,610
Why?

343
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,660
I guess the company must have seen the SNS posts displaying pictures of you.

344
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,070
I think they know you're "Part-timer Oppang" (Bread Oppa).

345
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:15,040
Bro, maybe this could be your last chance.

346
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,700
♫ The road the leads me to you shines like sunshine ♫

347
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,060
Lee Ji Hoon. You got the message, right?

348
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,430
Yes. But, how did you know about it?

349
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,360
Hey. Is this important?

350
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,970
Keep in mind. This is now your chance!

351
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,450
Why aren't you leaving now?

352
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,510
What chance? I'm leaving.

353
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,860
What? Hey, that jerk.

354
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,450
Who made this opportunity for you right now?

355
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,480
♫ I think about you all day ♫

356
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,090
♫ I’ll call out loud for you ♫

357
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:54,340
No. It'll be great if it works out well for you two.

358
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,860
♫ I’m happy with you here ♫

359
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,530
♫ Beautiful Beautiful ♫

360
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:08,330
♫ So that you can hear ♫

361
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,100
♫ Beautiful ♫

362
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,660
Is Thumbs Up coming or what?

363
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm sorry for calling you on your day off.

364
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,140
You never know what will happen in life.

365
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,040
Pardon?

366
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,910
Life is all about timing.

367
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,660
One of the debut team members got kicked out,

368
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,180
and you went viral as "Part-timer Oppang" (Bread Oppa).

369
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,480
Isn't it the perfect timing?

370
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,560
I'll do my best.

371
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,130
Wait a moment. CEO will be here soon.

372
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,990
Yes.

373
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,410
Please, I beg this for Ji Hoon.

374
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,090
What are you doing?

375
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,350
Can't you see? I'm praying.

376
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,530
For our Ji Hoon.

377
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,260
Aren't the guys back home yet?

378
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,490
Our Ji Hoon will be late getting home.

379
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,780
My mouth is itchy. I really want to say it.

380
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,160
- Don't tell others, you're the only one who knows!
- What is it?

381
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,750
Ji Hoon went to an audition today!

382
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,740
Hopefully, he'll do well and get into the debut team!

383
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,850
What? Then, what about Choi Woo Seung?

384
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,360
Didn't she say she was going hiking in a mountain? You mountain climber idiot!

385
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,010
Hey, darn it.

386
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm sorry I felt bad for a moment and said such bad words.

387
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,020
Please I beg you to help Ji Hoon.

388
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,380
Yes. He's already here.

389
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,920
Yes, I'll be right there.

390
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,090
Okay.

391
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,090
CEO came.

392
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,660
I'll pick him up, wait for us here for a minute.

393
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,560
Right. You also said you compose songs, right?

394
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,050
Pardon? Yes.

395
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,610
Do you have any of them now?

396
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,120
There are a few things I have saved on my handphone.

397
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,160
Okay. Show him everything you have today.

398
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,290
Thumbs Up?

399
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,660
Woo Seung said she hurt her leg hiking in the mountains. Now she's alone so she needs someone to pick her up.

400
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,850
You go there right now.

412
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:33,350
Never be two-faced with someone you love.

I won't be able to go back quietly.

422
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,320
What happened to you yesterday? I told you to go to Part-Timer.

423
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,050
But, why didn't you go?

424
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,950
Let me ask you one thing. Do you like Choi Woo Seung?

425
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,570
I asked if you like her.

426
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,180
This looks like a picture. Whose picture is it?

427
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,890
From someone. It's a picture of a beautiful face.

428
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,060
What's this contract with Bo Hee? Forget it. Cancel it immediately.

429
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,020
Look into my eyes. Who do you see in my eyes?

430
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,640
It's so hard for me to live this way.

431
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,090
Your manager is really having a hard time?

432
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,220
It's a miracle that he's still enduring it.

433
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,840
After Yoo Hyeon Jae went missing all of a sudden,

434
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,980
he went everywhere possible in the country looking for that person.

435
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,210

Can't we just be friends?

439
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,020
Can you have something like a kiss with me?

440
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,790
If I give up, it'll be the end of it. I'm not giving up now.
