00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,300
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,490
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,590
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,130
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,880
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,770
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,580
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,090
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,360
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,950
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,940
♫ When I still see you ♫

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,780
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,620
♫  I remember when we first met ♫

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,560
♫  You’re still so beautiful ♫

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ When I still see you ♫

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,710
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,880
That's why you should have been more careful. You don't look like you've been like that.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,660
How come you fall down and bump into things all the time?

21
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,450
No, well.

22
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,760
Fortunately, I think you only got a slight scratch.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,370
Does it hurt a lot?

24
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,490
It's bearable.

25
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,230
Why do you have to endure all the time? You shouldn't have gotten hurt from the start!

26
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,620
If you're sick, it's just not you who gets hurt, but the people around you also...

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,590
Don't get hurt for no reason. Don't get sick.

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,930
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

29
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,600
You don't know, but you're being a nuisance.

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,080
It's bearable? Try toasted sesame oil then.
(Toasted sesame oil has a deep earthy flavor.)

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,400
Wow... Sesame oil?

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,420
- I know, right.
- Enough of that.

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,670
So... what are you?

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,320
What do you mean?

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,820
What happened? Why are you at work?

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,520
And they were calling you PD.

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,830
That— It just turned out that way.

38
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,450
But how did it turn out that way?

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,560
Maybe... You...

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,720
Did your memories come back?

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,350
Do you know who you are?

42
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,280
I don't remember.

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,340
It seemed like you remembered something earlier.

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,540
I don't remember who I am, but I think I know what I used to do

45
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,630
- I guess I'm good at music.
- What?

46
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,160
By accident, the CEO of this company happened to see the composition notes I wrote.

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,960
You know this happens all the time. You run into an opportunity in life by accident.

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,360
Anyway, that's why he wanted to scout me as an employee for his company.

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,230
You know I also had nothing to do while being unemployed, so I thought it was good to take the job.

50
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,090
What nonsense are you saying?

51
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,920
Real life can get even more nonsensical than fiction.

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,390
Anyway, Part-timer. I've always emphasized this to you.

53
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,350
I must have been a great person.

54
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,910
Really?

55
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,810
Then why else would I have lived on the rooftop like that?

56
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,470
A great man like me is being despised and ignored by you guys.

57
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,970
Does that make more sense?

58
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,180
Well... I guess.

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,180
It's all done. It's amazing.

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,030
By the way, because of you, only I...

61
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,190
What? What is it again?

62
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,130
I'm sure you must have watched it somewhere...

63
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,390
What would it make me look like if you dragged me out so blindly like that?

64
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,870
It's just that there will be strange rumors about this.

65
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,100
Part-timer, by any chance, are you now blaming me when I'm the one who saved you and took you out?

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,430
Then, what kind of old-fashioned situation is this?

67
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,360
That's ridiculous.

68
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,290
Whatever. I'm not a part-timer anymore. I'm an intern. An intern!

69
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,960
An intern or a part-timer? That's the same.

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,500
Until you become full-time, you'll be a part-timer forever for me.

71
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,740
Oppa. Can you take a picture with me?

72
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,320
- Pardon?
- Please take one picture with me.

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,660
- Ah, well...
- Just one picture.

74
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,390
I'll take it.

75
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,390
Make it pretty like I have long legs.

76
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,290
One, two, three!

77
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,700
- Oppa. This time let's make a heart like this.
- No, that's a bit...

78
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,440
Please do it for me. Just one time. Please hurry up.

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,250
Then.

80
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,800
One, two, three!

81
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,110
You seem to be excited and having fun.

82
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,660
What brings you here?

83
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,050
Why is your phone turned off?

84
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,560
I get so many prank calls so I'm going to keep it turned off for a while.

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,230
Do I scare you if I visit you like this way?

86
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,000
Who's scared?

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,470
- Don't be scared. I came here to tell you something.
- What?

88
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,260
I think the manager of my first company saw your picture on the internet.

89
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,140
He asked me about you and I answered what I know about you.

90
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,380
He wants to meet you in person once.

91
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,260
- I can give him your number, right?
- My number?

92
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,310
You probably don't know but I was part of Ssen Entertainment.

93
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,770
If it's Ssen Entertainment, they don't accept random trainees.

94
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,190
I think it's a good idea if you meet him.

95
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm not sure.

96
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,530
What do you mean? You don't get this kind of opportunity easily.

97
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,780
I thought you were going to be this hesitant, so I actually gave him your number.

98
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,450
He'll be in touch with you soon. Make sure you pick up.

99
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,750
Why did you come here if you're going to do as you please?

100
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,150
- To see you.
- What?

101
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,150
It's enough now that I saw your face.

102
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,190
Other people are busy trying to keep girls or boys around as insurance or to flirt.

103
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,310
- You really don't even give me time to go inside your heart.
- I'm sorry.

104
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,480
Just don't say anything in situations like these. Don't pretend to be nice and then hurt my feelings.

105
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,320
Hey, Part-timer. You should tell me if you are leaving.

106
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,960
It's not loyal of you to leave work alone.

107
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,220
I don't know. Was there any kind of loyalty between you and me?

108
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,360
Hey. You're hurting my feelings again.

109
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,100
What is hurting your feelings?

110
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,320
Hey, do we even have a normal relationship or something like that?

111
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,560
It's not an easy task.

112
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,120
There must be a rumor about us.

113
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,990
I heard there's already a bit of rumor about us in the company

114
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,580
After all, we do not share a normal relationship, right?

115
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,180
Right.

116
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,880
The relationship between a slave and an owner is not normal.

117
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,640
It's a special relationship, right?

118
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,450
Again, you're at it talking about that slave rule. I'll definitely pay back your money.

119
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,610
I think I'll have to hit you to repay me for the loud commotion?

120
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,140
Aigoo.

121
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,100
Right. For the time being, please pretend in front of the guys you don't know that I'm working at Star Punch Entertainment.

122
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,420
Why?

123
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,580
You know, it's all too sudden.

124
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,400
You're right. To find out that the guy, I thought was the fool of the neighborhood, is actually my superior at work.

125
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
I should be the one to be shocked, right?

126
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,980
You're right. I'm kind of a fool.

127
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,220
Hey, why are you being so objective all of a sudden?

128
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,130
Fool. A fool that you keep missing and looking for, even if you're near him.

129
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,880
Awesome. I told you to stop making those lame jokes.

130
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,080
You're just a complete fool. Well... And it's not an abbreviation.

131
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,660
Fool!

132
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,330
I'm a fool who is so precious that you don't recognize me as a treasure even if I'm right next to you.

133
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,000
Fool! You're a fool who I want to punch in the face.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,630
I'm about to reach the end of my patience with you.

135
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,470
That was witty.

136
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,150
If there is really a strange rumor about us going around, I'm going to kill you. I am!

137
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,370
The Best Hit

138
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,570
You have to move to the center here, that's how you won't get your steps mixed up.

139
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,360
Our Woo Seung is here.

140
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,120
Do what you normally do. Stop using that kind of voice or else I'll tie your tongue in a knot.

141
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,030
Hey, Choi Woo Seung. I heard you filmed a movie in the lobby today.

142
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,270
- I should have been at that historical site.
- What movie?

143
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,910
Earlier today, they were filming a musical video in the lobby of the company...

144
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,220
But... Choi Woo Seung accidentally knocked down the lights.

145
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,670
As the lights dropped, sparks and flames flew up everywhere,

146
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,220
The scene turned completely into a total disaster.

147
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,060
One of the girl group members was hit on the head by the lights, so she was taken to a nearby hospital.

148
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,490
- What a liar.
- The director who looked upset...

149
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,090
The moment he was about to grab Choi Woo Seung and slap her in the face...

150
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,500
- What the hell is he saying?
- A new producer came in,

151
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,400
and just in time, he grabbed the director's hand and punched him in the face right away.

152
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,020
He started to have a nosebleed.

153
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,710
The new producer held Choi Woo Seung's hand and said,

154
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,970
"Baby, let's go."

155
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,340
He took her out doing that.

156
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,980
Is that true?

157
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,590
No way. That's all nonsense.

158
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,960
Hey, Choi Woo Seung. How on earth do you know this new producer?

159
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,170
What if I know him?

160
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,440
If you know him, please introduce him to me.

161
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,500
If he's really a general producer, he must be in a very high level position, right?

162
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,890
Forget it. Move aside.

163
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,820
She's playing hard to get.

164
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,360
What is this? Is it pineapple flavored?

165
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,820
Hey, Bro. I have nothing else to eat!

166
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,500
- Ah, we are friends after all.
- What friends?

167
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,970
Come to think of it, Bro seems to have a tendency to act like a beggar.

168
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,090
- Hey, stay still.
- Hey!

169
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,610
Let go! Aren't you letting go?

170
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,820
Hey! Do you want me to introduce the new general producer to you?

171
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,300
Yes. Will you introduce him to me?

172
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,530
There is a reason why kids who fail, always fail.

173
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,930
- What is she talking about?
- I don't know.

174
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,350
Ah, hey!

175
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,230
- Give me one.
- No.

176
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,460
- Just one.
- Wait a moment.

177
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,410
- I'll eat only one.
- Wait!

178
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,800
- Don't regret it.
- No!

179
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,600
- You'll regret it later.
- No!

180
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,420
Do you want a cup of coffee?

181
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,850
Coffee sounds nice!

182
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,390
Anyway, I was just about to get sleepy.

183
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,220
Why are you outside?

184
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,430
It's hot in my room, but it's cool and nice outside, so I like it.

185
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,590
How is your study going?

186
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,890
I think it's not as good as when I was studying at the academy, taking classes there.

187
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,680
You liked it when you were the fake Lee Ji Hoon, right?

188
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,660
Totally. Thumbs up!

189
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,800
Hey, I don't know how people think or do, but incredibly, you became a real celebrity in a few days.

190
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,510
What?

191
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,940
I didn't know this because I don't use social media or anything like that, but I heard you're really famous.

192
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,700
What's your nickname?

193
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,390
Bread... Breadman? Bakery guy? I don't think it was you.

194
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,600
I think you were more like Oppa...

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,710
- Part-timer Oppang.
- Ah, you're right. Part-timer Oppang.
(Ppang is bread in Korean, Oppang = Bread Oppa.)

196
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,040
Hey, kids are good at making up funny nicknames these days.

197
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,010
I'm so uncomfortable.

198
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,730
At this rate, what if you really become famous?

199
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,500
I heard that you are getting calls from famous agencies.

200
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,430
It's not exactly like I signed with them.

201
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,600
No. This time, I have a good feeling about it.

202
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:06,010
I was going to forget about all this, but suddenly I'm like this, and I honestly don't know what to do.

203
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,410
It just sounds like someone else's story.

204
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,330
- Grab it.
- What?

205
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,390
When you feel like you've got a chance, I'm telling you to grab it no matter what.

206
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,730
Hey, some people don't even get a chance, but in your case, this chance came to find you instead.

207
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,840
If you miss this chance, I'm sure you will regret it.

208
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,050
Are you sincere about that?

209
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,060
Of course, I'm sincere.

210
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,840
Then I'll grab it.

211
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,210
What?

212
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,280
I'll grab you and this chance.

213
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,030
♫ Light in the sky ♫

214
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,390
What was that?

215
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,090
You're making my hands and feet cringe.

216
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,200
If you keep doing this, I won't stay still anymore.

217
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,260
♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

218
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,800
I'm going to punish you with a beating.

219
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,210
I'm not kidding... Oh, really. It hurts.

220
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,030
♫ Fly, fly ♫

221
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,170
World Entertainment

222
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,000
- Hey, come here.
- Yes.

223
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,430
We are all going out anyway, so

224
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,350
let's play rock, paper, scissors, and the loser throws away all the food garbage!

225
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,620
- Deal?
- Deal!

226
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,810
- Deal.
- Deal.

227
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,600
To be honest, let's leave out the landlord.

228
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,070
Hey! Why? Why does Ji Hoon get to stay out of this?

229
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:38,640
Thumbs Up, maybe you are not, but we both are people with this little thing called a conscience.

230
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,870
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, of course.

231
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,890
Ji Hoon, you are out of this.

232
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,560
Hey, then let's play rock, paper, scissors quickly.

233
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,020
Rock, paper, scissors!

234
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,960
Yes!

235
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,700
Hey, what do you always play with scissors?

236
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,770
- She's been like that for a long time. She always plays scissors.
- Do you only play scissors?!

237
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,570
It's up to me.

238
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,140
Anyway, please take care of the food garbage.

239
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,090
You shouldn't have challenged me to a rock, paper, scissors game.

240
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,860
I haven't told you this, but I'm the king of the rock, paper, scissors game!

241
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,420
You were filming in a public area. Isn't it the basic that the cords should be arranged while filming?

242
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,050
Our staff member got hurt because of this. Who's going to take responsibility for this?

243
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,330
Is he really the same person?

244
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,800
Hey, you should go to the company quickly, I can throw this away.

245
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,790
Forget it. I'm the loser because I lost the game fair and square. Give it to me.

246
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,720
I can throw this away for you any time, so you just accept my heart instead.

247
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,990
Stop being cheesy.

248
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,430
What's wrong? That was a little bit of my confession of love.

249
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,150
You, seriously! Do you want to keep doing this?

250
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,300
Do you want to do this with the garbage between us?

251
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,290
Hey, you're not going to leave the garbage behind when you're gone.

252
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,740
Forget it. You throw away that garbage!

253
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,070
Father.

254
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,040
I don't think I can help you today with the bakery shop.

255
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,250
It's okay. I already told you that you should do whatever you want.

256
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,370
I'll help you again tomorrow. I have something to do today.

257
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,510
Okay then. Leave.

258
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,840
- Goodbye.
- I'll be back.

259
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,420
Ah, it's so hot.

260
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,190
- Where are you going again?
- You scared me all of a sudden!

261
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,470
Why do you care where I go on my own feet?

262
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,050
Don't get into trouble. Please stay quiet at home.

263
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,370
For whose sake am I'm like this now?

264
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,790
- What do you mean for whose sake?
- Forget it.

265
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,890
A petty man like you can never understand how deep and wide a heart a great man like me has.

266
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,520
A petty man?

267
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,100
Hey, everyone notices you're looking suspicious.

268
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,440
You should be more careful when you do things like this. Don't you understand?

269
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,820
You're nagging me over and over again. I already know that even if you don't tell me.

270
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,220
Hey, Helter-Skelter has an event in Suwon tomorrow. You have to drive them. Don't forget. You have to go.

271
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,030
I already know that too.

272
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,140
Right. That night you were drunk, do you remember saying sorry to me?

273
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,380
- Me?
- Yes. What was that about?

274
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,460
- Why would I be sorry to you?
- Exactly, why would you be sorry to me?

275
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,880
I must have been very drunk and it meant nothing for sure.

276
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,080
- I don't think that's the case.
- What do you mean?

277
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,700
Hey, I might say anything when I'm drunk.

278
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,450
- No. It was a drunken truth confession.
- What?

279
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,300
You've been so rude to me these days. Too rude.

280
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,090
I think maybe your unconsciousness is very sorry to me.

281
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,210
So be good to me.

282
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,870
I'm leaving.

283
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,340
This punk!

284
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,880
Speak slowly and clearly so that I can understand you.

285
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,390
So, Bo Hee is pregnant with whose baby?

286
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,180
I think it's Oppa Hyeon Jae's.

287
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,290
Are you certain?

288
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,350
What will Unni Bo Hee do? She's so pitiful.

289
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,900
She just wants to give up and go back to her hometown.

290
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,730
Oppa, please stop her from doing that. Please.

291
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,700
- Who else knows about this?
- Only me.

292
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,420
- What about Hyeon Jae?
- Unni won't tell him.

293
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,950
So the company doesn't know either, right?

294
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,360
From now on, if I hear about this anywhere outside of this office, I'm going to assume that it definitely came out of your mouth.

295
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,630
Make sure you keep this as a secret. Do you understand?

296
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,420
I'll see what I can do about Bo Hee.

297
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,930
Bo Hee. When you hear this message, make sure to call me back.

298
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,780
It's very urgent!

299
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,830
Bo Hee?

300
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,760
It's me. Yoo Hyeon Jae.

301
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,770
I didn't mean to bother you, but I just wanted to hear your voice.

302
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm going somewhere for a while.

303
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,520
Lee Gwang Jae. Are you listening to me?

304
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,830
So what? I don't even have time to chat with you on the phone!

305
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,150
Hey! What does where you go have to do with me?

306
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,080
I understand. I just thought of our old days.

307
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,700
I'll hang up now.

308
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,750
And I didn't know you'd be gone forever after that. I thought we'd have another chance to meet.

309
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,510
If you had known about all this, you wouldn't have disappeared, right?

310
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,870
Oh, welcome. What kind of picture do you need?

311
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,720
A profile picture.

312
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,840
Hey, this is really interesting.

313
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,620
Each track can be saved separately in a different file, right?

314
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,730
Maybe it's because it's the future, it's easy and comfortable to do a lot of things.

315
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,250
As expected of the future.

316
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,780
Ah, let's see...

317
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,630
Restricted number

318
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,550
What?

319
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,320
Who is it?

320
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,300
Hello?

321
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,520
Hello. I am Prosecutor Kim Seong Eun from Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office.

322
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,040
What? A prosecutor?

323
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,030
Yes, Sir. There is a secret bank account that was opened under your name. Did you know that?

324
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,260
What? A secret bank account?

325
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,730
Sir, we've already confiscated a large amount of money from your account.

326
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,030
Thumbs up!

327
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,290
So I guess I put my money in my bank account?

328
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,330
Sir, to confirm that this is your bank account,

329
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,800
you need to make a deposit to us. How much can you deposit to us?

330
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,530
No, no, no. I'll go there myself.

331
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,840
Where are you again? Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office?

332
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,120
No, no. You can make a bank transfer...

333
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,710
I said I'll go myself.

334
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,350
Sir. You just can transfer it from your account.

335
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,280
Ah. I don't have any bank accounts...

336
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,380
so I'll go now.

337
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,570
Why is it so hard for you to understand?

338
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,390
You can only transfer to our account. What's up with your earholes? Are they blocked or what?

339
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,490
Are you kidding me now?

340
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,350
What?

341
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,710
You. Are you a police officer?

342
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,220
Hey! You can't catch me even if I'm dead. Do you get it?

343
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,780
Aigoo. My goodness. Thumbs up? What did he mean by saying "Thumbs up"? That's old-fashioned.

344
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,740
Did you come here on a time slip or what? I don't use words like "thumbs up" either.

345
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,090
Aigoo. What a tacky and outdated guy.

346
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,460
What?

347
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,890
What was that?

348
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,610
Hey! Why are you doing here again? This is my office!

349
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,300
Ah. I was about to leave anyway. You can use it.

350
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,230
It's my office, of course, I should use it.

351
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,530
Right. You told me to let you know if I need anything, right?

352
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,640
- What?
- Give me some money.

353
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,310
I already gave you money the other day.

354
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,130
You gave it to the bank. Is there something like a credit card?

355
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,620
Give me a credit card.

356
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,990
Will it be okay?

357
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,590
Just let him have whatever he wants for now.

358
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,150
Keep an eye on him and let's see what on earth he came here for.

359
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,020
Ah, did you look into what I told you to find out?

360
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,600
Yes. He lives in the rooftop room of the World Entertainment Company.

361
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,030
No wonder! The last time I peeped at it...

362
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,210
- Pardon?
- What?

363
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,480
And, what else?

364
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,860
Ah. I checked the ownership of his handphone and it belongs to CEO Gwang Jae.

365
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,870
Really?

366
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,240
Then, it's all that punk Gwang Jae's scheme.

367
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,980
Mi Gyeong, let's go to eat.

368
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,960
Yes, Team Leader.

369
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,160
Woo Seung, I'm sorry. First, finish that and then you go to eat.

370
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,660
Pardon?

371
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,320
Ah, yes.

372
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,760
We'll be right back.

373
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,820
Let's go.

374
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,900
I'll go first.

375
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,170
What shall we eat?

376
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,560
Do they think interns don't get hungry?

377
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,730
If I had known this, I'd have had a full breakfast.

378
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,700
What? What's wrong with it?

379
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,270
Spit it out quickly.

380
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,020
I don't know if you may have swallowed other people's money, but don't mess up with me. I'm Choi Woo Seung.

381
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,590
Spit out the money or spit out my coffee!

382
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,900
Do it quickly!

383
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,190
What? Look at this little thing.

384
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,760
Second Place.

385
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,780
Why are you fighting with a vending machine that remains still?

386
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,830
It ate my money.

387
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,490
Move aside.

388
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,370
This is my specialty.

389
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,970
Wow! It's amazing! How did you do this?

390
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,010
Try it once. You have to feel it.

391
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,180
Okay, like this...

392
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,480
Listen to the sound after knocking on it a bit.

393
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,350
It's here.

394
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,210
What is that? Is Part-timer laughing in front of him?

395
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,880
- It's not coming out.
- Do it again.

396
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,940
Ah, Lee Ji Hoon. You said you'd take care of it yourself.

397
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,630
You'll learn the lesson to get your act together when that song thief steals her from you?

398
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,270
Why isn't it working?

399
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,920
Part-timer, what are you doing?

400
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,230
Ah, I was trying to get a can of coffee.

401
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,450
You're the new producer, right?

402
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:56,940
What? Yes. You have a lot of things to settle with me, don't you?

403
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,930
- Pardon?
- Wait slowly.

404
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,560
- Your turn will be coming soon.
- Me?

405
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,690
- What are you talking about again?
- I meant

406
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,200
I have nobody to eat with because my manager went to the hospital.

407
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,870
Let's go and grab something to eat together.

408
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,330
Hey, I can't. I have a lot to do.

409
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,110
Will there be a war if you eat properly first?

410
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,090
Hey, but still...

411
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,380
She can't eat with you.

412
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,730
Pardon?

413
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,790
Because she's eating with me.

414
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,810
What are you doing again?

415
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,300
If you don't eat with me, there will be a war. Let's go.

416
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,520
Then after you eat, you can contact me. I have a job for you.

417
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,520
No. She'll be with me all day today!

418
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,510
Here.

419
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,230
What was that?

420
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,560
Hey, Thumbs Up! Do you have fun holding my wrist and dragging me out? What's wrong with you?

421
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,820
Do you think I wanted to drag you out?

422
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,930
He'll make you do something weird again, and you'll just be annoyed.

423
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:18,150
So I only got you out there like this before that happened.

424
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,930
Thumbs Up, do you think that makes any sense?

425
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,060
I'll take care of it myself.

426
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,940
And here is the company.

427
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:32,640
You can't call me Thumbs Up! It'll make things difficult. Here, I'm your superior.

428
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,850
Thumbs Up! No, then how am I going to call you?

429
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,400
Just call my name.

430
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,840
What's your name?

431
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,420
At work, it's Da Bong.

432
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,030
It is a very different name.

433
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:49,590
Da Bong. From now on, I won't call you Thumbs Up!

434
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,830
Right. Did you say you were busy today?

435
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,440
I'm busy.

436
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,530
I'll call them about you, so stay with me today.

437
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,070
Why do you do that all of a sudden?

438
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,920
What if all of a sudden, I remember I have some work for you to do? What should I do then?

439
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,650
Da Bong, do you know what you are doing is called?

440
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,590
It's a power trip. And it's a superpower trip.

441
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,720
A power trip? Hey, how can you talk like that?

442
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,790
What is a power trip?

443
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,810
You. What you are doing now?

444
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,620
Anyway, follow me. It's important.

445
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:29,930
So... What am I going to do here?

446
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,180
From the bottom of your heart, you only have to say,

447
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,040
"You're cool! You're the best!"

448
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,890
That's all I need you to say!

449
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,250
What?

450
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,230
Then, shall we start?

451
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,050
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

452
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,000
♫  Twinkle even more today ♫

453
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,200
♫  Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

454
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,270
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

455
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,760
Hey, this looks great on me and this one too, right? Because I have a handsome face.

456
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,440
- But, which one looks much better? Look.
- That one.

457
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,700
This one. Then, I'll take the other one.

458
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,930
♫  So the whole world can hear ♫

459
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,960
♫  I wanna confess to you ♫

460
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,600
What are you doing? Cue! There you go.

461
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,720
♫ And I have something to say ♫

462
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,330
♫  something to tell ♫

463
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,920
♫  I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

464

♫  I’ll tell you ♫

465
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,960
♫  I love you ♫

466
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,590
♫  It’s a beautiful day ♫

467
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,970
♫ And I have something to say ♫

468
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,790
♫  something to tell ♫

469
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,680
♫  I wanna go crazy ♫

♫  I wanna hold you tight ♫

471

♫  Sometimes, I wanna put everything in love ♫

472
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,250
♫ And I have something to say ♫

473
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,060
♫ something to tell ♫

474
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,000
♫ I wanna shout out your name  ♫

475
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,030
- Hey!
- What?

476
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,150
You forgot to do it.

477
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,180
- What did I forget?
- To say it from the bottom of your heart.

478
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,750
You're cool! You're the best!

479
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,560
You're thumbs up!

480
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,400
Okay.

481
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,080
But, you are... I'm really embarrassed for you.

482
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,040
What?

483
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,650
Although I don't remember, I'm sure I've never hung out with a country girl as old fashioned as you.

484
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,970
What are you saying?

485
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,040
Don't embarrass me anymore, so go and get changed.

486
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,460
No, thanks.

487
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,730
You must have forgotten it sometimes, but this is an extension of your work.

488
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,850
If your boss tells you to do it, you'll do it, right?

489
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,590
You. You now picking on my clothes is called a personal attack. I can even sue you for that.

490
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,880
How an employee dresses affects the company's image.

491
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,770
What did I do? What's wrong with my clothes?

492
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,230
Fine. Then, let's play rock, paper, scissors. The winner can do whatever he wants.

493
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,740
Deal.

494
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,530
Rock, paper, scissors!

495
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,370
How dare you, scissors!

496
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,990
I was really the king of the rock, paper, scissors game.

497
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,130
This is a bit uncomfortable.

498
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,100
Don't you think it'll be a little too much for me to wear at work?

499
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,160
Not at all.

500
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,020
The clothes are all fine, but your face is all messed up.

501
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,940
What?

502
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,250
Hey, no one who lost their country would have a face like yours.

503
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,280
Bring the bags with you and follow me.

504
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,190
You little! No one who lost their country?

505
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:01,030
So, what's going on with MJ's activities in China?

506
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,720
I have already talked to them about him,

507
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,090
and they're very positive.

508
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,730
Is that so? Okay then.

509
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,230
Let's get everything ready and make sure it goes smoothly.

510
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,220
Yes, I understand.

511
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,490
Hey, what on earth is that punk still buying?

512
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,160
Wait, let me see. Aren't these women's clothes?

513
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,020
No way, that punk is already after a woman...

514
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,180
That's right. If he's the real Yoo Hyeon Jae, he'd do this.

515
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,900
Stop buying more.

516
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,800
Shocking Lips. Hey, try this.

517
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,740
Let's look forward to your shocking transformation.

518
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,450
This looks nice. Try this one.

519
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,960
What shocking transformation? I can't believe what you're making me do.

520
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,740
Give it a try.

521
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:20,940
♫  Then I hope you will hug me without a word ♫

522
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,130
I already told you I can't lie, right?

523
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,130
♫ Show me your heart ♫

524
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,070
You're pretty. It's really shocking.

525
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,860
What's wrong with you?

526
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,050
While we are it, let's buy each one of them by color.

527
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,000
No, forget it. What's wrong with you?

528
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,570
I thought you were going to do as I say because I won the rock, paper, scissors game earlier.

529
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,830
♫ The flowers flutter with joy in the sweet breeze ♫

530
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,020
Stop, that's enough.

531
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,090
Let's buy them all.

532
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,830
Let's go. Ah, this one too.

533
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,310
- Please stop.
- It's okay.

534
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,340
♫ My heart is beating ♫

535
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,810
- I'd like to pay for all of these.
- Yes.

536
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,820
- Forget it. I'll pay for them.
- No way.

537
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,500
♫ I want to confess to you today ♫

538
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,660
I said I'll pay.

539
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,100
You lost rock, paper, scissors game. I'll do whatever I want.

540
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,930
You already bought the clothes earlier.

541
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,730
I'll pay with this card.

542
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,500
♫ I always looked only at you ♫

543
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,710
♫ I think about you all day ♫

544
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,620
♫ I’ll call out loud for you ♫

Profile
Lee Ji Hoon

546
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,200
♫ Beautiful Beautiful ♫

547
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,160
You've been a trainee for a long time. Why do you think you couldn't make a debut last time?

548
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,990
♫ Beautiful ♫

549
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,000
I thought that trying hard was the only thing that was important back then.

550
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,300
But, I think I felt hesitant at the last minute.

551
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,900
I wasn't sure if I was qualified enough to be on the stage.

552
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,130
So what about now?

553
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,640
Are you sure about it?

554
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,770
♫ So that you can hear ♫

555
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,980
Yes.

556
