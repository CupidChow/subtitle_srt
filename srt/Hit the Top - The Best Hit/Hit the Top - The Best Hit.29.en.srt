The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,300
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,510
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,690
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,100
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,830
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,720
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,510
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,110
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,390
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,050
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,470
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,080
♫ Oh oh ♫

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,440
♫ If you ♫

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,270
♫ If you come to me ♫

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,770
♫ I’ll feel like I have the world ♫

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,060
♫ I’m shouting to the sky ♫

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,050
♫ It’s only you ♫

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,910
♫ I’m closing my eyes, with all my heart ♫

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,550
♫ I’m calling out to you ♫

21
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:23,140
♫ I love you, I really want you ♫

22
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,260
Da Bong.
♫ Are you listening? ♫

23
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,090
♫ I know it took too long ♫

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,130
♫ For me to figure out ♫

25
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,960
♫  how I feel about you ♫

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,700
♫ I want to hold your hands ♫

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,990
♫ I won’t let go of you ♫

28
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,970
♫ If you ♫

29
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,780
♫ If I lose you, there is no reason anymore ♫

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,420
How could I leave you behind and leave? How could I?
♫ Always, until always ♫

31
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,720
So don't go. Anywhere.
♫ I’ll stay by your side ♫

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,400
♫ I’m closing my eyes, with all my heart ♫

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,160
♫ I’m calling out to you ♫

34
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,220
♫ I love you, I really want you ♫

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,050
♫ Are you listening? ♫

36
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,100
♫ To me? ♫

37
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,620
We're here.

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,350
I know, right?

39
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,010
Why did you get a home so close?

40
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,450
Don't make the person who walks you home feel bad about it.

41
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,890
Yes, yes, sure. I'll get one very far from here next time.

42
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,990
Go inside.

43
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,000
You go first. I'll go inside after seeing you go.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,550
No, you go first.

45
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,270
Normally in things like this, the men stay until the end.

46
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,480
That nonsense sounded so outdated again even in this 21st century.

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,130
Seriously, go first. I want to see you go.

48
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,930
Hurry up and go inside!

49
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,760
We're going to stay up the whole night if this continues.

50
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,340
So.

51
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,180
Okay, then. Get home safe.

52
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,120
I'm leaving.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
Okay, go.

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,910
What's this? Why?

55
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,800
How do you look like someone older and more conservative than me?

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,190
Me? Where?

57
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,900
I mean, that... why?

58
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,760
These days, there is a trendy saying that girls say when their boyfriends walk them home.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,420
A trendy saying? What are you talking about?

60
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:59,780
No, what I meant to say is that there's something that's just getting popular across the country. I'm sure of it.

61
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,650
- What?
- Ah, whatever, never mind.

62
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,450
Go inside. I'm leaving.

63
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,730
Okay. Go carefully.

64
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,210
I mean, how could you not know about eating ramen?

65
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,530
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat ramen and then leave?

66
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,600
- No, you don't do that because you're hungry—
- Of course!

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,620
Never mind. Forget it. You said you only focused on studying, but you really only studied.

68
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,700
You don't know the deep meaning of ramen.

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,830
Aren't you going to eat ramen? I'm a little hungry.

70
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,330
- Did anyone say I won't eat?
- You'll eat?

71
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,290
I'll eat! I'm going in! You don't even know the meaning of eating ramen.

72
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,030
Okay. But in return, you have to cook it. Deal?

73
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,110
The Best Hit

74
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,860
- Stop it, stop it.
- Oh! What are you doing?

75
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,630
The noodles have to be chewy for it to taste good!

76
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,580
What are you talking about? They have to be a bit soggy for it to taste good.

77
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,920
Aigoo, you don't know how to eat ramen.

78
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,590
I didn't want to brag about this but, I'm Dr. Ramen because I know a lot about it.

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,970
Oh, hey! What are you doing, why are you adding an egg? It'll change the soup!

80
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,950
Ramen is the best when an egg is added! What are you talking about?

81
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,740
Wow, how could you get nothing right?

82
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,390
Aigoo. That's why we're attracted to each other.

83
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,600
What?

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,010
Normally, they say opposites attract.

85
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,000
You're attracted? To me? Like a magnet.

86
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,460
Anyway, you're such a smooth talker.

87
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,670
Thumbs Up!

88
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,770
Thumbs Up! It's done.

89
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,150
How is it? It's still good enough to eat when an egg is added, right?

90
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,660
Not bad.

91
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,130
You'll crave this later.

92
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,300
But... where were you planning to go?

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,860
I'm not sure. Just anywhere.

94
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,900
I thought that I was giving people who were already living well a hard time for no good reason.

95
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,580
Making one mistake was enough. I didn't want to hurt those people again.

96
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,880
If I just disappeared, somehow everyone would live happily.

97
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,100
Wouldn't it turn out that way?

98
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,030
Hey, that's not it.

99
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,390
Do you have a place to go?

100
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,780
I do.

101
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,060
- Where?
- I have one.

102
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,300
So you don't have one.

103
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,200
I told you I do.

104
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,220
Then where are you going to sleep tonight?

105
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,880
After looking into it, there seems to be a lot.

106
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,760
Well, there are saunas and PC rooms.

107
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,730
Just... stay at my place.

108
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,720
What?

109
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,160
Not because I'm thinking of you, but because of me.

110
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,640
It's because if I don't see you in front of me, I'll get anxious.

111
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,860
How am I supposed to know if you disappear again?

112
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,890
Aigoo. That's the story of my life.

113
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,980
There's nothing easy going on for me.

114
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,800
Bro, I'll go and shower.

115
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,680
Ah, it's hot, it's hot. Why is it so hot?

116
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,120
By any chance, do you think it's because it's summertime?

117
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,480
I see. I thought it was because of the high temperature again.

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,250
Don't use the towels wastefully.

119
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay!

120
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,840
What's this?

121
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,870
I'm sorry I'm not the one you thought I was.

122
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,530
Still, thank you for everything.

123
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,040
There's no turning back time.

124
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,610
I hope you have time without regrets.

125
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,790
♫ Yes, fool, I have a lot to say to you too ♫

126
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:43,440
♫ All day, I wrote down funny things that happened ♫

127
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,990
Thumbs Up, are you sleeping?

128
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,080
No. You?

129
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
I'm talking because I'm not asleep.

130
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,540
Ah, thinking about it, that seems to be the case.

131
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,050
Why? You can't sleep?

132
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,680
I'm tired, but I can't sleep.

133
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,470
Me, too.

134
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,140
But, about you... Why did you go missing 20 years ago?

135
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,740
Well, I'm not sure.

136
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:36,300
But, to think that there was someone around me who wanted me to disappear that much...

137
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,260
It doesn't make me feel good.

138
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,650
Whether it was Yeong Jae or anyone else.

139
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,370
It wasn't your fault.

140
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,870
What?

141
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,450
Even if it was like that, it's not your fault.

142
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,990
Hey, the wrongdoer is always at fault. Why would the victim be at fault?

143
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,650
So, don't blame yourself for that weird thing.

144
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,180
Blame myself?

145
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,470
I think I'll have to find out.

146
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,670
- But, you're so fearless.
- What?

147
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,940
- What again?
- I mean, aren't you too trusting of me?

148
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,730
I'm a man, too. And I'm very healthy.

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,840
♫ Listening to you as you’re in my arms ♫

160
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,410
♫  Having you in my arms ♫

161
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,000
♫  Our eyes, our memories, our hopes ♫

162
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,790
♫  I’ll remember it all ♫

163
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,040
World Entertainment 
♫ Tonight ♫

164
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,120
Here, the song's out.

165
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Listen to it. I think it's pretty good for now.

166
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,690
The song came out this fast?

167
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,430
Wow! Director, you're really amazing!

168
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,350
What kind of song is it?

169
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,960
Hip hop is popular these days.

170
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,770
Well, of course, I trust CEO's ears, but...

171
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,600
- Hey, Drill.
- Yes, Director.

172
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,030
- There are two things on earth that I hate the most: One is men.
- What?

173
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,050
The other one is flattery. Are you a man who flatters people?

174
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,750
No, no, not at all. Me? How could I flatter?

175
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,030
Look at that, that.

176
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,050
Okay, whatever. Just listen for now.

177
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,930
♫ When I still see you ♫

178
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,750
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

179
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,740
♫  I remember when we first met ♫

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,580
♫  You’re still so beautiful ♫

181
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,500
♫ When I still see you ♫

182
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,470
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

183
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,150
♫  I remember when we first met ♫

184
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,180
This song is really similar to the one that I composed.

185
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,650
♫ Do you remember when we first met? ♫

186
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,830
♫  I went to see you every day, Fool ♫

187
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,410
♫  I went to where you worked ♫

188
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,000
♫  I stole glances at you every day ♫

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,370
It's not like my phone has feet or something.

190
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,350
Why does it keep disappearing?

191
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,860
♫ I will treat the beautiful you as a queen ♫

192
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,610
♫ I promise you my lovely wife ♫

193
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,910
♫ You are the sun that shines on me ♫

194
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,810
What's this?

195
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,600
♫ Even though we’re young ♫

196
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,790
♫  Our love is deep, walk on this path with me ♫

197
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,600
♫  Write my name as your husband for all your life ♫

198
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,640
♫ Though you can’t cook ♫

199
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,550
♫  I’ll still eat it, oh yeah ♫

200
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,510
♫  Our twilight is still far away ♫

201
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,210
♫  Let’s share our young love ♫

202
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,500
♫  Pinky promise me ♫

203
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,510
Oh, this is pretty nice.

204
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,510
Let's see, let's see.

205
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,230
♫  And telling it to go slow for our youth ♫

206
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,980
♫ When I still see you ♫

207
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,880
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

208
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,780
♫  I remember when we first met ♫

209
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,690
♫  You’re still so beautiful ♫

210
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,550
♫ When I still see you ♫

211
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,890
- How is it? What do you think?
- It's the best!

212
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,690
Hey, I told you to stop fluttering me.

213
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm not! I'm being honest. I like that song. I sincerely mean it.

214
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,990
But... who wrote this?

215
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,570
Why? Do you not like it?

216
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,210
Ah, that's not it, I like it, but

217
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,290
Thumbs Up, that guy wrote it, right?

218
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,910
Da Bong?

219
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,100
I asked him to.

220
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,580
So our choreography, too?

221
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,140
Yeah, that too. I asked for that, of course.

222
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,820
If it's Da Bong? Oh,  Thumbs Up?!

223
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,790
He had this sort of talent?

224
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,520
That's awesome.

225
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,100
What's going on with MJ's song?

226
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,480
We've been talking to some close reporters right now,

227
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,380
and they say that this will cause an impact much bigger than we thought.

228
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,510
That's so obvious. Aren't we supposed to do this because we want to make a huge impact?

229
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,400
But still, he's been Star Punch's main artist until now.

230
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,080
If we somehow get tangled up in this, it's going to harm us too.

231
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,270
So that's why I'm saying that it's important to plan out everything beforehand.

232
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,440
To plan out?

233
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,230
Ah, you are so frustrating.

234
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,430
Make it sound as if a songwriter came forward to announce that he has the conscience to tell the whole truth.

235
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,210
"I'm telling the truth, I have the conscience to announce that MJ's been overusing his power."

236
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,700
"It was all a fraud from the beginning. Out of all the songs released as self-written by MJ,

237
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,010
there are no songs actually written by him. It's been a case of tyranny, he's been exploiting me."

238
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,390
Can't we just go like that?

239
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,960
But what if MJ wants to renew his contract with us?

240
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,930
Tell him that it's fine. Whether it be a person or an animal, it's hard to bring back someone whose heart has gone elsewhere.

241
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,100
Tell the reporters to release the news on Friday.

242
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,120
Then he won't be able to do anything over the weekend.

243
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,820
MJ isn't the type of person to just stand by like that.

244
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,950
But what if he finds out that you ordered it?

245
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,460
The dirtier and messier this fight gets, it's only going to get worse for him since he'll be at a disadvantage.

246
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,450
We should still brace ourselves for a bit of a mess.

247
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,530
Yes, Reporter Seung. I know, it has been a while.

248
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,570
Yes, yes, I will lift you up for once.

249
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,770
So just make some time this weekend, okay? I'll make a reservation.

250
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,690
Also... you heard about my MJ, right?

251
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,610
Let's talk about the details when we meet. Mm, okay!

252
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,360
Hey, what are you doing, not departing quickly?

253
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,910
Yeong Jae... It's me.

254
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,190
Ah, you surprised and shocked me. What are you doing here?

255
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,690
Because I have something to ask you.

256
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,380
Huh? What is it?

257
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,410
Yeong Jae... I don't have much time left to live.

258
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,620
What? What kind of joke are you pulling?

259
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm telling you that I'm not scared of anything!

260
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,530
S-Stop saying useless things and get out the car quickly!

261
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,790
If you tell me the truth, nothing will happen to you.

262
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,820
What— What if I don't? Does that mean something will happen to me?

263
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,680
This a threat, you know that, right?

264
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,700
My disappearance. Do you know anything about it?

265
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,360
I don't know. I'm telling you I don't know!

266
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,950
After I went missing, you took my notebook with you.

267
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,160
Then, logically speaking, wouldn't it be right for me to find you the most suspicious?

268
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,930
So what? Are you saying I did something to you?

269
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,290
Why did I disappear in 1994?

270
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,990
I feel like you know something about it.

271
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,230
I know that I have no excuses to provide for stealing your notebook,

272
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,280
but do you really think that I did that to you because of that?

273
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm a victim too. And then you just disbanded J2 all of a sudden.

274
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,290
Didn't you run away with the settlement money by yourself?

275
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,700
With you disappearing, do you know how much I suffered alone?

276
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,460
I ended up performing in nightclubs and in cafes in Misari too.

277
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,990
And then I met Kathy, started my business, and got to where I am now.

278
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,540
Honestly, did you even treat me like a human?

279
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,940
Hey. How could you say it like that?

280
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,430
Well it's true, is it not?

281
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,350
It's not like that, okay?

282
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:15,630
I'm just bad at expressing myself. You know how I am.

283
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,090
Anyway, I'm sorry if you took it that way.

284
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,560
How could you cry over this?

285
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,280
Here.

286
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,190
Crying? As if!

287
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,840
The day you went missing, I was there at that lake too.

288
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,860
What?

289
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,620
I don't know anything else, and I didn't see his face that day, but

290
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,090
there was definitely one more person other than you.

291
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,060
I thought it was Gwang Jae until now.

292
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,150
There was one more person?

293
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,580
There were definitely two. Why would I lie about it now after coming this far?

294
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,610
Where did that phone number go?

295
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,960
And this handwriting, sheesh!

296
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,760
I'll be down at the office.

297
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Okay, you do that.

298
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,710
Whose photo is that?

299
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,900
Oh, it was in here.

300
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,020
Oh, that's Mal Sook's mom.

301
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,600
If you come to think of it, the accident happened around this time of the year.

302
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,230
You're right it did.

303
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,780
Aren't you going to visit her? You haven't gone in a while.

304
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,240
She left before her parents. That's nothing commendable, man. I'm not going to keep looking at someone like that.

305
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,360
You always say things you don't actually mean.

306
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,180
She's always so pretty, no matter what.

307
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,100
Hm? Yeah, she was pretty.

308
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
Whose daughter is she? Of course, she's pretty, you jerk.

309
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,440
How are things going with you two?

310
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,360
What about me?

311
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,140
Aigoo, you idiot. I mean with you and Bo Hee, you punk.

312
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,470
Well, just consider that we're doing well. That's all you need to know.

313
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,060
Oh, that maggot-like bastard.

314
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,250
I guess after 20 years, he's about to make a move on her for once.

315
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,600
If I wasn't alone during the time I went missing,

316
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,180
then that means that there is definitely a suspect.

317
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,230
I used to play your music, Oppa, every time there was an OP.

318
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,720
My juniors would make fun of me because the songs I played were considered old.

319
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,300
After that, I started playing classical music.

320
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,890
But an 8-year-old little princess had her lymph node surgery today.

321
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,540
Perhaps because of you, I finished the surgery successfully

322
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,540
and I'm about to get some rest now.

323
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:22,000
Who is she? She was a doctor? She grew up well.

324
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,850
I'm contacting you after I saw your post on Shopping Mall Yoo Hyeon Jae's website. Can we meet sometime?

325
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,720
Questions on Yoo Hyeon Jae's disappearance

326
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,530
Yeah, it's me.

327
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,870
Where did you go all of a sudden?

328
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,900
You were so adamant about getting me to leave, and now you're worried?

329
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,190
I was saying that you should leave when you've found a place.

330
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:59,160
Don't worry, because I'm getting by very well.

331
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,520
Are you practicing well?

332
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,810
I actually called because of that. Thanks for the song.

333
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,810
Hey, you wrote almost all that song.

334
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,470
No. Others don't know it but I know what I wrote the best.

335
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,840
If it weren't for you, the song wouldn't have been bearable. I don't have that kind of ability.

336
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,560
It's not to that extent.

337
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,730
I just touched up the song here and there.

338
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,090
The choreography too.

339
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,960
Do you like it?

340
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,800
To be honest, very much.

341
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,740
Then that's a relief. I was feeling a bit burdened.

342
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,020
Aigoo. As you know, I write songs.

343
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,500
By your standards, I was active 20 years ago so I might be behind time.

344
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,810
I think you write better than the active composers these days.

345
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:49,000
I know, right? You can just think that anything I do is amazing.

346
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,690
Well, hip hop is popular these days,

347
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,080
and if we add some vocal pitching in the middle, then it should be great.

348
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,230
Try not to persuade your audience like that.

349
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,080
Don't persuade them, just overwhelm them.

350
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,290
That's how it should be.

351
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,530
It'd be nice if I could guide you in person.

352
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,870
I'll just point out a few things while talking on the phone.

353
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,550
Can I do that?

354
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,100
Of course. Just tell me anytime.

355
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,600
Ah, right. Also...

356
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,760
Thank you for your help.

357
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,000
You're welcome.

358
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,830
The person you're trying to call isn't available. Your call is being forwarded to...

359
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,420
Ah, is he in the middle of a call?

360
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,900
Who has he been talking to all day?

361
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,660
- Woo Seung, you seem to have a boyfriend.
- Pardon?

362
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,130
Aren't you supposed to say that to a boyfriend?

363
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,800
Ah, it's not like that, though.

364
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,540
Everyone, do you remember Kaola?

365
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,330
It was the twin Typhoon called Kaola, which hit Korea in 1993.

366
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,470
A typhoon with a similar route to Kaola is approaching our country again.

367
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,040
But, the National Weather Service said that this typhoon is...

368
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,470
The typhoon is scary, but it has to rain properly

369
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,360
because we're experiencing a long drought this summer.

370
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,920
Pardon? Ah, yes.

371
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,580
I'm sorry, but can you please turn the radio back on?

372
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,400
Well, I can.

373
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,490
This typhoon Danas is similar in many ways to the 1993 typhoon Kaola.

374
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,450
Of course, it's of public interest because not only they have the same path of progress,

375
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,380
but also the possibility of the two typhoons developing into connected twins.

376
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,500
The name Danas means "experience" in Filipino...

377
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,100
A Typhoon called Kaola, which means "time," is heading North.

378
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Native Hawaiians believe that when the wind named Kaola blows, lost and forgotten memories come back to you.

379
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,870
What's this all about?

380
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,400
Which memories of the past do you want to retrieve tonight?

381
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,010
Are you busy?

382
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,120
What? No, no, come in.

383
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,480
You seem busy, so I feel like I'm wasting your time.

384
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,690
I'm busy, I have to be busy in order to make money.

385
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,820
But, what's going on? You said you'd take a break for the time being?

386
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,160
I just have something to request of you.

387
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,160
A request? What is it?

388
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,630
- I don't think you will like it though.
- What?

389
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,930
You know I've been releasing Master's songs as if they were mine.

390
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,760
I feel already bad about being quiet and not talk about it.

391
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,130
CEO, if you give me your permission, I'll announce the truth. In a cool way.

392
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,590
In a cool way?

393
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,450
That's right, it's time to do it.

394
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,900
But, I'm worried that if it's known, it's going to be hard to receive support from the investors.

395
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,270
It'll be hard, right? It seems I shouldn't do it...

396
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,470
Do you want to do it?

397
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,780
Well, I can't wait to get it out of my chest as soon as possible.

398
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:10,260
But, if this brings you trouble and puts you in a difficult position, then it can't be helped.

399
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,580
First, shall I endure it?

400
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,270
Then, let's do it.

401
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:26,160
Yes. I'll endure it.

402
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,020
No. Let's announce the truth.

403
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,790
Probably, it'll be hectic for a while.

404
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,630
I am prepared.

405
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,200
Excuse me, are you Da Bong?

406
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,560
My gosh.

407
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,050
Yes.

408
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,630
Are you the owner of the Lost and Found Cafe "Questions on Yoo Hyeon Jae's disappearance"?

409
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,410
- You're Pink Star?
- Yes.

410
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,400
You must be surprised that I asked to meet you all of a sudden?

411
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,000
No, it's not that.

412
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,810
You look like him.

413
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,570
You look like Oppa Hyeon Jae a lot.

414
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,770
Back then, there was no place I didn't follow him to for all his concerts and TV broadcasts and recordings.

415
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,740
I've seen him in person so many times.

416
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:28,520
Even though you have the same appearance as Oppa, if you said you were him, I would believe you.

417
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,060
- What if I'm really him?
- Pardon?

418
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,060
If I am, then how much would you believe me?

419
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,930
Ah.

420
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,790
I have something to ask you.

421
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,210
But the doctor I know here is you, Pink Star. You're the only one I have.

422
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,820
Anyway, it's a disease that can't be cured by modern medicine.

423
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,070
I don't want to be remembered as a sick person until the last moment

424
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,450
That's not Yoo Hyeon Jae's style.

425
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,470
I want to remain as a star for you till the end.

426
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,230
As the last gorgeous star.

427
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,260
They said it's a terminal disease so they can't do anything more.

428
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,690
It's my body but I didn't even know.

429
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,280
♫ Light in the sky ♫

430
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,400
Yes, it was literally an incurable disease. It was also fatal.

431
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,150
It was hopeless even in the '90s.

432
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,970
But in the early 2000s, a complete cure was developed.

433
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,680
Now, only the name is scary.

434
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,230
Should I say that it became similar to a lifestyle disease (like diabetes or obesity)?

435
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,810
It is also possible to cure most diseases if you receive treatment and take medication well.

436
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,900
♫ Light in the sky ♫

437
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,240
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

438
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,200
♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

439
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,390
♫ Some day fly, fly, fly ♫
A typhoon similar to the 1993 twin typhoon Kaola that caused disaster is heading North.

440
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,780
What? By the way, you're going out this late?

441
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,320
Yes. I have a meeting.

442
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,400
Aigoo. Why don't you drink less? It's even hot outside.

443
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,190
Then, I'll take care of it myself, you punk.

444
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,590
I will be back.

445
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,590
Is it because he feels lonely?

446
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,560
Where am I?

447
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,520
Why am I here?

448
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,810
I have to go there.

449
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,380
It's hot. So hot.

450
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,780
I don't see President Soondae.

451
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,110
He seemed a bit strange the other day.

452
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,710
Maybe he has dementia or something like that?

453
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,860
Hey! What are you talking about? He's fine.

454
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:52,990
Well, I heard it's normal for a while. But they tend to go back and forth from being fine to being ill. It gets worse.

455
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,230
Where am I?

456
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,530
Hey, hey, hey! Don't worry about it.

457
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,930
President is actually healthier and he'll live longer than us.

458
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,450
President is a very strong man. What dementia will he have?

459
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,890
I'm just worried.

460
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,820
Hey, this office really reminds me of the past.

461
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,190
What happened? I heard you took your luggage out of the rooftop room.

462
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,590
Such rumors are fast again.

463
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,600
If it wasn't a rumor I heard, I'd have still found out.

464
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,540
You're worried about something? What is it?

465
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:36,090
Hey, I told you I keep receiving messages in my beeper from the past.

466
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:41,650
The more I think about it, It feels like I'm still connected to that world.

467
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,530
I have a feeling that the past keeps looking for me.

468
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,060
Come to think of it.

469
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,650
If I decide to not go back,

470
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,700
the past we know will change, right?

471
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,210
Then, will it be a world without Yoo Hyeon Jae?

472
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,860
And here, it'll lead to changes in everyone from the future again.

473
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:11,050
Everyone's lives here will change because of me.

474
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,640
I'm not sure about anything.

475
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,580
As you said, if anything changes right now...

476
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,460
Hey, the mere thought of it makes me feel terrible.

477
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,860
You and Bo Hee started to date in 1994.

478
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,820
You haven't been able to go out with Bo Hee yet since you have traveled over here.

479
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,000
Then, what will happen to Ji Hoon?

480
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,550
Aren't you supposed to be in the past so that Ji Hoon can exist?

481
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,390
Thumbs Up, why aren't you coming?

482
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,690
Will you come home for dinner, right?

483
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,880
The Best Hit

484
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,400
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
