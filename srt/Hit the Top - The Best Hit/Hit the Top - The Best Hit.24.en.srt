00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,920
First, let's start with a business plan and meet some investors.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,590
Thankfully, a few places have already agreed to meet me.

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,750
The idol star industry is like a red ocean these days,

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,060
but we still have our one shot, right?

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,240
Yes. You're right.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,930
Aigoo. Where did it go? Where is it?

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,200
Are you feeling sick? Why have you been like that since a while ago?

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,130
No, no. It's nothing.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,160
Where on earth did it go?

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,880
What's up with him again?

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,930
In the bathroom?

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,820
I knew it wouldn't be here.

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,670
My gosh.

27
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,970
Ah, where could it really be?

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,160
In the refrigerator?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,800
There is no way it'd be here either.

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,110
Where did it really go? Where could it be?

31
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,900
Why can't I remember?

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,660
Did you lose anything?

33
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,200
No, it's nothing.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,820
Hey, Thumbs Up! Aren't you going to work?

35
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,910
Thumbs Up went out a long time ago.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,970
What? He said I should be loyal somehow.

37
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,790
He left by himself.

38
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,920
What's your request?

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,500
I don't know how you feel about Woo Seung but...

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,530
I already told you about my feelings.

41
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,140
I thought you don't even know who you are, where you came from or what kind of person you were.

42
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,830
I hope you stop your feelings for Woo Seung. Please, I beg you.

43
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,620
She's been hurt a lot.

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,660
I hope she doesn't get hurt again.

45
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,870
This is a favor that I'm asking you as her closest best friend.

46
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,760
That's right. Lee Ji Hoon is not wrong, right?

50
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,240
Hey, Thumbs Up! You disloyal punk!

51
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,930
What?

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,540
No, well... You said I wasn't loyal to people because I don't tend to go together with them.

53
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,430
Why did you go by yourself today? You're not really loyal, are you?

54
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,050
Ah, I was joking. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,540
What's with you?

56
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,210
Are you upset with me?

57
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,950
No, it's not like that.

58
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,710
What's wrong with him?

59
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,200
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

Hey! Bakery Child!

62
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,220
Why are you sighing? Do you have a problem?

63
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,700
Ahjussi, you wouldn't get it even if I told you.

64
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,790
Hey. I've lived at least three times more than you have.

65
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,130
Also, I'm not an old man for you to call me ahjussi. I'm young, call me Oppa.

66
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,170
Oppa Da Bong. "Da" means The Greatest, and "Bong" means Phoenix.

67
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,890
Anyway, go ahead and tell me about it. What is it?

68
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,770
If I tell you, you're going to say I'm too childish.

69
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,270
Aigoo. Hey, what's so bad about a child being a little childish?

70
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,670
Tell me about it.

71
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,710
- It's not my story. It's really, really my friend's story.
- Okay.

72
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,000
I said it's my friend's story.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,150
I got it. It's not your story. Go ahead and tell me.

74
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,110
My friend has this guy that she likes.

75
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,950
But my friend's friend also likes the same guy.

76
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,530
What?

77
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,360
But, my friend is trying to forget about that guy for her friend's sake.

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,470
However, it didn't work out.

79
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,990
Really?

80
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,540
Can she forget him?

81
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,990
I'm not sure.

82
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,060
Does your friend miss him and want to see him even when she is doing nothing?

83
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,590
Yes. How did you know?

84
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:37,100
Does she just have this throbbing pain here like this, right?

85
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,320
Yes. It throbs.

86
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,470
Thumbs Up, you're home late.

87
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,310
We're eating omelet rice for dinner. You're going to eat together with us, right?

88
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,680
No. I already ate.

89
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,940
Hey.

90
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,270
Why is he acting like that all of a sudden? It makes me worried.

91
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,030
Omelet rice!

92
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,730
What's with you?

93
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,320
Me? I'm just hungry.

94
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,180
Eat slowly.

95
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,030
- It's really good.
- Delicious!

96
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,660
It's really delicious.

97
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,240
Why is Thumbs Up acting like that all of a sudden?

98
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,110
I shouldn't care about him.

99
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,390
Why is he doing that? He's like a sulky five-year-old kid.

100
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,140
No. Don't mind him. Stop thinking about him.

101
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,700
Then, I'm going to stop caring about him now!

102
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,960
This is bothering me. He's on my mind.

103
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,860
What's wrong? That is not my style.

104
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,210
Is that so bad?

105
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,790
No matter how different the song is, aren't you talking too directly?

106
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,890
- What?
- So, do you want me to change it to another song?

107
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,150
No. I'll keep listening to it.

108
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,910
What is it? Is there something on my face?

109
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,840
No.

110
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,500
Hey, I must be going crazy.

111
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

112
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,280
Right. It's nothing if we bump into each other.

113
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,060
It's possible that we could run into each other briefly by chance.

114
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,170
Who are you...?

115
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,900
Are you looking for someone?

116
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,410
Pardon?

117
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,120
No. No, I'm not.

118
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,620
I see that your interns must have gone out.

119
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,690
They're out now doing some field work.

120
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,240
Ah, field work.

121
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,670
Where did they go?

122
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,390
Lower it.

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,260
Pardon?

162
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,630
Hey.

163
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,350
Part-timer.

164
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,300
- What is it?
- What?

165
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,190
No, I just wanted to say part-timer. Please calculate it.

166
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,500
- Please give me your card.
- Oh, yes.

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,580
Cake

168
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,510
It's a lot of trouble to work on a hot day. Eat this and share it with your colleagues.

169
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,370
I've been sticking so many pieces of tape to all the posters that my hands feel numb.

170
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,210
I know, my hands too. My back hurts and I haven't had lunch yet.

171
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,910
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

172
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,910
Cake coupon

173
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,060
Then, shall we eat this?

174
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,860
- What's that?
- Yes, I'd love to.

175
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,450
- Let's go this way.
- Let's go.

176
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,740
- It looks delicious.
- I'm hungry.

177
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,090
Cake coupon

178
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,520
Friend, why would you send me something like this?

179
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,740
Anyway, thanks. I'll eat it well. Instead, I'll pay for the movie tickets next time!

180
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,110
The cakes your ordered are here. Enjoy them.

181
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,940
Thank you.

182
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,210
They look so delicious.

183
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,150
- So cute.
- I'll eat it well.

184
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,360
Thank you.

185
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,090
Excuse me, I'll order later. My guest hasn't come yet.

186
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,060
Ah, yes.

187
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,960
Yes, CEO Son.

188
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,760
I am waiting for you now.

189
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,850
Yes, CEO Lee. I'm sorry. Something urgent about the company came up and I have to take care of it.

190
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,400
It'll be hard to see you today so I don't think I can make it. Can't we talk over the phone?

191
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,450
It's a little difficult to say it over the phone.

192
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,570
Then I'll come and see you at your office later.

193
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,570
Yes, yes. Goodbye.

194
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,060
My gosh!

195
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,690
- CEO Lee!
- Are you okay?

196
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,410
The world is indeed small. I didn't think I'd meet you here.

197
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,820
Ah, yes.

198
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,290
Do you have a meeting here?

199
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,420
What meeting? I'm just here to eat.

200
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,580
Entertainment Business Plan

201
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,450
Dear, what kind of business are you trying to start?

202
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,980
No, it's nothing.

203
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,830
When you see things like this, you have no entrepreneurial skills.
- What?

204
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,910
You have the best investor in front of you, but you don't even recognize her.

205
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,580
It's said to only cut your coat according to your cloth. I know you wouldn't help me.

206
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,670
- Why do you think that?
- Pardon?

207
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,180
I'm a human too.

208
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,380
Do you think I'm happy to see Oppa Soon Tae and you live like this?

209
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,820
This isn't the original one, right?

210
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,670
Yes, yes.

211
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,890
You know I have a good nose for money.

212
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,130
I'll read it and get in touch with you if it smells like money and it's worth investing.

213
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,640
- It's okay, right?
- Yes.

214
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,480
No. It's nowhere to be found.

215
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,070
I can't find it. I couldn't even find it. This is frustrating.

216
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm getting dementia, and I can beat it. I can't beat you.

217
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,120
There is no way I can win.

218
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,540
Where on earth is that stupid book? Where on earth, it is? I can't find it.

219
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,230
It would not matter if I didn't know.

220
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,720
Oh, it's so hot. It's so annoying.

221
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,420
Friends, we are reading a book today, right?

222
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,730
Yes!

223
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,310
Right. Please take out the book you brought from your home.

224
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,300
Yes!

225
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,400
How to fight against dementia and win!

226
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,150
How to fight against dementia and win!

227
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,190
Mal Sook, I don't think this is a book you should read.

228
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,530
I don't know. But, my grandpa put it in my bag for me.

229
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,200
Hey, I wanted to borrow his car. Where did he go?

230
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,590
Perhaps he didn't leave his car keys, did he?

231
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,180
Music Note
The Best Yoo Hyeon Jae

232
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,390
This is mine.

233
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,760
This is what I wrote until 1994.

234
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,460
Rooftop. Floor. Cash. A way to get in...

235
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,490
What are you doing over there?

236
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,620
What are you doing? Are you even going through my desk now?

237
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,500
It's not like that. Let me borrow your car.

238
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,540
No. I have to use it all day.

239
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,650
Then, can I use any car from the company?

240
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,060
All the cars from the company will be used all day too.

241
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,250
What is it? Is it urgent?

242
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,370
No. It's just I feel restless somehow.

243
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,260
I thought I could go and get some fresh air!

244
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,700
Don't try to act up. Just go and enjoy the breeze of a fan.

245
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,000
Forget it. This punk is so mean.

246
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,950
Move aside!

247
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,440
What's wrong with that punk?

248
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,940
I didn't even know I wrote songs in 1994 either.

249
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,990
What is this? It's a ballad.

250
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,650
Pick up Bo Hee at Marronnier Park at 2 pm.

251
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,260
Pick up Bo Hee...?

252
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,240
Go for a drive with Bo Hee, eat pork cutlet at Mount Nam.

253
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,960
Payment hidden in the rooftop

254
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,450
There was definitely no money hidden in the rooftop.

255
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,560
Hey, seriously.

256
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,760
It's "to coda."

257
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,970
If it's "to coda" then that means you have transferred it to a coda section.

258
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,950
What is this?

259
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,290
Does it mean I moved it and hid it somewhere else?

260
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,120
Oppa Ji Hoon!

261
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,880
Your oppa is not here. What's up kiddo?

262
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,870
Ah, new products were just delivered at the store,

263
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,000
and it's hard for ajumma to move all of them by herself.

264
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,720
Is that so? Then, I'll go and help her.

265
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,000
Let's go.

266
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,700
I was wondering how to do all these by myself, and thanks to you everything has been moved in.

267
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,920
Thank you.

268
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,880
Hey, you're welcome.

269
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,350
Ah, well I don't have much to do for you.

270
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,470
Just sit down and I'll bring you some of the new bread that came in so that you can eat it.

271
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,680
Ah, yes.

272
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,000
Ajumma, can I play a round of a game on your phone?

273
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,260
Promise it'll be only one.

274
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,800
Here.

275
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,780
Ahjumma! I need your passcode to unlock your phone.

276
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,530
22198!

277
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,430
22198... Yay!

278
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,330
22198?

279
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,920
Would this much be enough?

280
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,520
Ah, yes.

281
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,470
- Excuse me, let me tell you that your passcode is quite unique.
- What?

282
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,240
I meant your handphone passcode.

283
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Ah. That's the number I've been using it out of habit for a long time ago.

284
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,460
Does it mean something else?

285
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,030
Well... 22198.

286
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,850
Ah, you must not know this.

287
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,570
We used to carry beepers with us in the past.

288
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,410
At that time, when you wanted to be alone with your loved one, we'd express it in numbers.

289
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,550
22198. It meant "I want to be with you alone".

290
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,950
It was like a code for me.

291
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,180
A code?

292
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,080
When I was younger, I dated someone in secret.

293
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,500
22198 was a code that he and I used when we wanted to meet each other.

294
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,400
Aigoo. This is silly. I don' know why I'm boring you by talking nonsense.

295
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,360
No.

296
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,520
Bro, let's eat. Come out!

297
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,590
I don't feel much like eating.

298
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,790
Let's eat together.

299
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,720
You guys eat without me.

300
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,440
- What about Part-timer?
- She went to attend a special lecture.

301
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,890
Ah, I see.

302
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,940
I'm going to get some fresh air.

303
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,780
Okay.

304
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,890
Aigoo. Hey, I almost couldn't make it if I got there late.

305
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,970
How to fight dementia and win!
Volume 2

306
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,760
That's right.

307
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,470
This time, I'll make sure to read it until the end no matter what.

308
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,390
Hey, dementia!

309
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,990
I'm definitely going to punch you in the back of the head!

310
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,210
Right. Here I go.

311
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Grandpa! Make sure I take my slippers with me tomorrow! Make sure!

312
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,690
Okay. I got it, you little brat.

313
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,020
I must fight against this damned dementia,

314
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,070
so that I can take care of her backpack and send her to school properly.

315
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,770
Sure, I must.

316
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,760
Oh, why am I so sleepy?

317
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,910
Her slippers? Did she say her slippers?

318
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,420
Her slippers. Ah, they're here.

319
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,090
Her slippers are right here.

320
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,330
Okay, here.

321
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,810
Aigoo, I'm so tired. This is perfect. Just perfect.

322
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,060
Aigoo. Why am I so sleepy?

323
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,930
I need to wash up...

324
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,200
That's right. It's enough. I'll forget about her.

325
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,600
Although I don't remember, she is the woman my son likes.

326
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,370
It didn't make any sense from the very beginning.

327
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,590
What is this?

328
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,750
My gosh!

329
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,100
Ah, why is it raining?

330
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,940
Ah, what should I do?

331
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:16,270
Thumbs Up! What are you doing here?

332
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,500
What are you doing here?

333
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,550
We run into each other so many times these days.

334
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,330
You're right.

335
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,960
Wait a second.

336
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,250
Take this and go.

337
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,640
Let's go in together.

338
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,170
I'm supposed to meet someone.

339
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,060
Is that so? What about your umbrella?

340
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,570
I think I'll be given a car ride. I'll buy one later if I need it.

341
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,960
Oh, I see.

342
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,280
Thanks for the umbrella. I'll go now then.

343
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,730
Okay.

344
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,660
♫ It's a bit awkward ♫

345
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,100
Thumbs Up, are you already asleep?

346
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,460
The guys and I are going out to eat ddeokbokki.

347
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,210
Come with us together. It's an instant ddeokbokki place, and they say the taste is like art.

348
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,100
When have I ever turned my back on ddeokbokki?

349
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,490
♫ I don't know what it is ♫

350
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,830
Here you are.

351
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,410
Is it spicy?

352
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,320
Have some water.

353
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,510
- Thumbs Up! Aren't you going to work?
- I 'm going to work now.

354
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,100
♫ I haven't told you yet ♫

355
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,390
I'm being serious for real. It's small...

356
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,280
Thumbs Up? What are you saying?

357
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,920
Thumbs Up! You're home late.

358
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,540
We're eating omelet rice for dinner. You're going to eat together with us, right?

359
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,780
When it comes to omelet rice, I'm the best at it. It's my favorite!

360
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
Here.

361
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:15,960
♫ I will confess in front of you ♫

362
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:23,570
♫ I wonder what it's like for you ♫

363
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:30,770
♫ I don't know what love is ♫

364
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:38,740
♫ Oh, I think I'm excited about you. ♫

365
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,520
♫ I didn’t know love ♫

366
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,510
♫  I guess I’m still too young ♫

367
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,880
♫ Whenever I looked at you ♫

368
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,330
♫  My heart fluttered for some reason ♫

369
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,240
♫ Your clear eyes ♫

370
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,090
♫  They were so kind ♫

371
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,510
♫ I couldn’t fall asleep ♫

372
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:30,650
♫  I could only think about you ♫

373
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,620
♫ If you ♫

374
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,490
♫  If you come to me ♫

375
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,870
♫  I’ll feel like I have the world ♫

376
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,310
♫ I’m shouting to the sky ♫

377
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,840
♫  It’s only you ♫

378
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,250
Thumbs Up!

379
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,160
♫ I’m closing my eyes, with all my heart ♫

380
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,690
♫  I’m calling out to you ♫

381
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,280
♫ I love you  ♫

382
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,130
What's going on?

383
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,560
Thumbs Up.

384
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,530
♫  If I lose you ♫

385
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,870
♫  There is no reason anymore ♫

386
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,990
♫ Always, until always ♫

387
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,270
♫  I’ll stay by your side ♫

388
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,050
♫ I’m closing my eyes, with all my heart ♫

389

♫ I love you  ♫

391
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,020
Additional scenes
♫  I really want you ♫

392
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,990
♫  Are you listening? ♫

393
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,900
Gwang Jae

394
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,790
Why would my father call him...?

395
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,470
Why aren't you picking up my calls?

396
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,760
Ah...
Hey, Yoo Hyeon Jae! Are you listening to me?

397
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,020
Hey! Yoo Hyeon Jae!

398
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,710
Hey, Yoo Hyeon Jae! Hey, what are you doing?

399
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,330
Yoo Hyeon Jae! Ah, seriously.

400
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,540
Hey, Yoo Hyeon Jae!

401
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,110
♫ If you ♫

402
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,080
♫ If you come to me ♫

403

411
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,340
The Best Hit

412
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,300
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
