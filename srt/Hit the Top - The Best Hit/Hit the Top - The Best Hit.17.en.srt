13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,050
Hey, Thumbs Up! What happened?

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,890
Did you cause trouble again, right?

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,420
What's wrong? What's going on?

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,760
Choi Woo Seung.

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,010
Did something happen?

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,160
You asked me before.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,590
- Ask you what?
- About the person I like.

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,280
I want to answer that question.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,980
No, I will tell you.

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,820
What are you talking about? That's so random. Let's talk inside.

23
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,300
There's someone I've liked for a long time.

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,750
She's someone you know.

25
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:31,680
She's you. You. Choi Woo Seung.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,720
You're the person I like.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,060
Ever since you were Park Woo Seung, Yoon Woo Seung,

28
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:45,560
and now you're Choi Woo Seung. Not as a friend, but as a woman.

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,160
Hey! Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,180
It's not all of a sudden. It's been a long time.

31
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,110
I've liked you for a long time.

32
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm not asking to give me an answer right now. You also need time to think about it.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,950
No, wait. Wait a moment.

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
Why can't you even give me time to breathe?

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,970
- Sorry. Take your time and think about it.
- No.

36
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,180
No.

37
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,780
I don't need any time to think about it.

38
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,080
I'm sorry, Lee Ji Hoon.

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,050
To me, you're not... a man.

40
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,260
I thought it'd be better to make it clear in advance. I'll go in first.

41
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,000
I didn't mean to overhear it. I was about to go out and you two...

42
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,450
I really didn't mean to.

43
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,840
What's really going on?

44
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,500
Ah! What was that, Lee Ji Hoon?

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,920
Why would you do such a thing?

46
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,420
Aish, seriously.

47
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,260
I guess I'll have to eat this.

48
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,300
Aish. It's all stuck. Is it a rice cake or what?

49
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,360
Ji Hoon, that punk, liked part-timer all this time?

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,940
Ah, whatever.

51
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,710
Aish, seriously.

I don't know how to comfort you because I've never been rejected by a woman before.

56
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,820
But you know there is a saying which goes, "There are plenty of fish in the sea..."

Okay then.

What?

74
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,160
Well, you showed up all of a sudden and you startled me.

75
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,070
Did you go to work out?

76
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,170
I just went for a run.

77
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,860
- You're leaving early?
- What? Yes.

78
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,440
The way you chose is to avoid me?

79
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,260
Why would I avoid you? Did I get rejected? Or did you get rejected?

80
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,910
That's right. I got rejected.

81
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,010
- No. I didn't mean that...
- But...

82
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,310
- From now on, I'll do whatever I want.
- What?

83
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,420
- I won't give up on you.
- What?

84
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,040
It's up to you to refuse me, but it's up to me to keep liking you.

85
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,800
Okay, then. Lee Ji Hoon. I admit you have high standards in women.

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,130
Your standards in women are better that I thought.

87
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,380
But, we are friends.

88
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,760
There is a line that should not be crossed between friends.

89
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,590
- I'm not going to be friends with you anymore.
- You seriously!

90
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,960
It took me eight long years to tell you I like you.

91
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,380

96
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,290
What do you mean?

97
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,260
What?

98
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,500
Are you really trying to make me pass out foaming at the mouth?

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,620

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,040
I'm making copies.

106
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,450
- You put down the wrong side.
- I'm sorry.

107
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
You're acting weird today.

108
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,000
There is going to be a meeting so please get them ready immediately.

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,100
♫  I only love you ♫

114
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,130
Today, you didn't go to the company.

115
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,240
It's none of your business. What are you doing there?

116
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,870
What? Well, I'm exercising. One, two...

117
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,920
- Are you taking a day off from your company?
- I quit.

118
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,140
What?

119
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,960
Hey, Did Gwang Jae...? Are you doing that because of your dad?

120
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,250
Hey, this is your life. What does it matter who opposes it?

121
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,600
Anyway, you don't have to listen well to useless words.

122
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,430
It doesn't matter.

123
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,310
You, living like a loser, is frustrating.

124
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,700
When your deceased dad could see you from up in the sky, what would he say to you?

125
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,000
"Aigoo, you're frustrating. Please get a hold of yourself."

126
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,300
Don't you think so?

127
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,700
Why are you bringing him up here all of a sudden?

128
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,420
No, I didn't mean to. It's frustrating to see you being like that.

129
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,450
Do you think we're friends just because we hung out a few times? Get your act together!

130
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,460
To me, you're just a burden who lost his memory.

131
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,370
What? A burden?

132
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,950
Hey, are you looking down on me as a pushover because I'm living off you?

133
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,230
Get off my bed.

134
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,000
- It's my bed for the time being.
- Catch it.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
I hate cockroaches the most in the world!

136
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
So, you're going to stay like this?

137
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,920
Ah! Its antennae!

138
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,470
Oppa! Help me with my homework.

139
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,380
Mal... Malk Sok! There is a cockroach there. A cockroach!

140
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,890
A cockroach?

141
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,150
Over there!

142
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,030
I caught it.

143
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,810
You caught it? Good!

144
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,490
Then, clean it up.

145
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,020
You can throw it away in the toilet.

146
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,360
Aigoo. This cockroach has been wandering around very hard to look for food since early in the morning.

147
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,660
What are you two doing at home at this time?

148
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,160
Homework. What can I do for you?

149
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,850
- Your face. What's with your face?
- Wash.

150
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,690
Wash! You wash up your face. You wash it.

151
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,900
Okay. A bowl...

152
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,160
Why can't they go down and take a look at her homework there?

153
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,090
Ah, I should sign in to the internet cafe to check things.

154
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,360
Let's see.

155
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
What is this?

156
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,400
"How to win over your female friend's heart?"

157
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,770
What are you looking at?

158
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,320
You can't use my laptop without my permission!

159
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,030
This is invasion of privacy!

160
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,840
What privacy or whatever? You're still just you.

161
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,220
What were you searching that for?

162
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,630
It wasn't me.

163
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,440
If it wasn't you, then did the cockroach come up to search for it?

164
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,940
Also, why would you ask the Internet those things?

165
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,880
Hey, there's now an expert dating doctor right in front of you.

166
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,350
An expert dating doctor?

167
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:49,050
I don't seem to remember, but anyway, I think I have stolen a lot of women's hearts.

168
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,510
Enough. Forget it.

169
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,380
- Do you know what your biggest problem is?
- I said to forget it.

170
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,690
You can't see each other as a man and a woman because you two are too comfortable friends. Too comfortable.

171
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,220
The important thing to do is, you must step outside the friend zone. That's it.

172
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,480
Stop joking around.

173
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,130
The number one tip that I, the expert dating doctor, suggest is... Natural skinship.

174
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,150
What skinship?

175
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,030
What is this?

176
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,990
How was it? It looked natural, right?

177
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,010
Forget it. That was so dirty.

178
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,120
Be careful. I don't want you to fall down.

179
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,230
It looked natural, right? That's what natural skinship is.

180
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:48,410
Women are more inclined to fall for you with just one action rather than one hundred words.

181
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,670
If you keep accumulating affectionate touches like this,

182
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,410
you'll leave a great impression and she'll like you more.

183
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,600
Your spirits will soar.

184
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,990
I'm going to the bakery. Thanks, but I haven't heard a thing you said.

185
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,250
I guess it would be nice if I could help them get together.

186
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,080
Welcome.

187
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,730
What? What are you doing here?

188
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,240
Why are you wearing that again?

189
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,780
I don't want to just bum around. I'm looking after the store while I'm on break.

190
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,380
Who asked you to do this? Do what you want to do from now on.

191
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,000
This is what I want to do now.

192
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,440
You might be tired of driving all day. Then go upstairs and rest. I'll take care of the store.

193
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,490
No. I'm fine.

194
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,690
- I'm so hungry.
- Welcome.

195
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,510
- What should I eat?
- Wait, let me see.

196
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,680
That one seems good.

197
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,380
- What's this made of?
- Cheese...

198
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,990
Oh! That's Disagreeable Oppa.

199
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,280
Oh! Oppa! Do you work here?

200
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,900
We are regular customers here. I got goosebumps!

201
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,400
There are many things to get goosebumps when it's hot. Take your time looking around.

202
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,870
Okay then. Aigoo. It's nice to see our oppa here.

203
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,610
Hey, what are we eating?

204
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,320
- Is it something new?
- That's right.

205
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,690
- But...
- Yes.

206
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,870
The more I look at him, isn't he handsome?

207
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,730
What? Where? Let's see...

208
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,600
I didn't know but look at his sharp nose.

209
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,270
You're right. I didn't notice it before because he kept covering his face with a mask all the time.

210
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,180
Looking at it now, it's nice and warm.

211
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,800
That's right.

212
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,970
This time, he didn't make it to join the debut group, right?

213
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,650
Aigoo. That's too bad. He must have suffered after working so hard.

214
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,070
Aigoo. What can we do about that?

215
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,340
- I'll take this one.
- I want this one.

216
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,430
Wait for a little bit, let me see this...

217
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,930
Oh! Wow!

218
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,190
Hey, this came out like a beautiful painting.

219
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,550
Hey, shall we do something for him?

220
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,250
I have a good feeling about him. Wait!

221
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,170
What? I even got that for her.

222
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,880
Then let's get down to business and look for my money.

223
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Where is it?

224
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,390
It's just as I expected it to be.

225
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,530
What?

226
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,460
You must have used it all.

227
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,640
How could I have spent all that money in a year? Does that make sense?

228
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,750
It doesn't make sense for an average person. But if it is Yoo Hyeon Jae, it makes sense.

229
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,040
What?

230
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
You don't seem to know you very well,

231
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,500
but you are even more capable of doing that to survive.

232
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,580
- No, I'm not.
- Why not?

233
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,040
Still but, wouldn't I know myself better than you?

234
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,650
Aigoo. I was just wondering if I was going to hit the jackpot.

235
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,770
But, I don't think I'll ever hit the jackpot in my whole life.

236
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:27,130
No. I'm sure it's somewhere.

237
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,130
What? Do you have any idea where it is?

238
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,250
That's my gut feeling. My gut.

239
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,960
You have lost your touch.

240
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,670
It's so hot and he called for nothing. It's useless.

241
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,010
How many times have I told you to take good care of and control your kids?

242
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,880
How could he get drunk and drive when he's about to debut soon?

243
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,220
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,230
The group must have five fixed members. What are you going to do if one of them is left out?

245
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,140
Among those kids who went to the end of the final test, I'll choose a good one—

246
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,990
There must be a reason why they failed in the end.

247
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,320
Right. That's the case too.

248
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,960
- Isn't there anyone we can bring in?
- What?

249
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,020
A trainee from another company. Don't you share information like that these days?

250
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,730
Well, companies have tight security restricting access.

251
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,160
But, you still have to try. We can convince them to come. It's up to them.

252
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,460
Ah, seriously.

253
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,730
If I could, I'd go to some island in the Pacific or something,

254
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,380
and I want to sleep there for three days before coming back.

255
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,090
I'd enjoy my time lying down in a hammock.

256
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,830
What are you doing when it's hot?

257
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,880
Can't you see?

258
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,290
It's strange at any rate.

259
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,190
- I'll help you.
- Forget it.

260
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,690
I want to make this alone.

261
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,540
Whatever.

262
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,470
- But, you know...
- What?

263
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,190
What do you like about Choi Woo Seung?

264
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,720
Why are you curious about it?

265
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,610
No. I mean there must be a reason somehow.

266
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,040
I don't have a reason. I just like her.

267
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,670
You can't like a person without a reason in this world.

268
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,880
I don't have a reason to like her.

269
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,120
I like her because I like her.

270
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,010
Hey!

271
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,920
It'll be faster if we do it together. Why would you do it by yourself?

272
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,260
Then, hold on to that side.

273
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,080
Who do you take after that you're...?

274
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:06,000
Aigoo, forget it. I'd be digging my own grave.

275
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,760
Give it to me.

276
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,450
Team Leader: Choi Woo Seong, are you done organizing the file?

277
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,130
Yes. I'll be right there.

278
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,130
Okay. This should be enough. Where did you learn to create and organize a presentation so well?

279
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,500
Ah. I used to do a lot of group presentations, myself.

280
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,010
While I'm doing the presentation, make sure to change the slides on time until the end.

281
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,870
Yes, don't worry.

282
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,560
Ah. You'll have to connect your laptop to the projector with this.

283
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,520
So let's start the meeting on MJ's new song concept.

284
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,940
First of all, fashion.

285
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,200
Part-timer, what are you doing?

286
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,550
Is MJ, that scumbag, going to boss you around again today?

287
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,380
I heard he made you signed his signature on many posters on his behalf yesterday too?

288
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,600
Anyway, I'm planning on teaching a lesson.

289
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,230
Are you coming home late today? I have something to show you.

290
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,010
Anyway, call me when you're done.

291
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,460
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

292
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,510
Woo Seung, how could you leave the message window on during the presentation?

293
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,230
- Sign out of it quickly.
- Yes.

294
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,370
So, what is this? She's in a love triangle with Thumbs Up and Slave Underdog.

295
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,650
Are they "The Double U Crew"?

296
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,250
The Double U Crew. That's funny.

297
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,090
Later, I'll use this as a joke.

298
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,100
The Double U... Crew.

299
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,210
Hey! Why didn't she reply when she read the text messages?

300
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,700
Now, she's ignoring my text messages.

301
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,410
Do you think that will make me give up?

302
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,310
Second Place, do you badmouth me outside the company?

303
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,220
It's not like that.

304
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,740
I'm sorry.

305
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,340
I thought we were like family, but you're nice in front of me,

306
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,880
and you write hateful comments about me behind my back.

307
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,600
Really, I've never written any mean comment.

308
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,160
If you're lying about this,

309
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,310
you'll be doomed forever from today onward.

310
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,970
I wrote a few times.

311
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,430
I'm going to sleep here, so get out.

312
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,470
Clean things up later.

313
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,010
Choi Woo Seung. Let's talk for a moment.

314
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,790
Didn't I tell you to pretend not to know me at the company?

315
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,000
Forget it. I'll give you a piece of advice so listen carefully.

316
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,070
- Lee Ji Hoon and you are never allowed to be together.
- How dare you?

317
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,830
If you were me, and your friend seems to be giving up on being a trainee and now he's going to give up his life too,

318
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,900
- would you be able to stay still?
- What?

319
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,910
It seems there are a lot of people and ears here.

320
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:23,050
A rumor like this... can be really fatal to Ji Hoon.

321
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,510
Follow me to the rooftop.

322
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,600
Hey, seriously!

323
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,830
Hey, what's all this?

324
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,520
Why are you home so early?

325
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,980
The meeting ended earlier than expected. But, what is this?

326
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,060
Ta-da! I was going to show you this to surprise you.

327
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,870
You told me you wanted to rest on a hammock.

328
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,010
Well, even if it's not an island, it's just... You can pretend it is. Make yourself feel better.

329
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,450
It was really hard today.

330
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,760
"Ji Hoon, I didn't know you'd care about me so much."

331
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,460
"Looking at this hammock, I'm also starting to like you."

332
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,340
You didn't expect this kind of reaction, did you?

333
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,750
Don't even look forward to it.

334
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,230
Not at all.

335
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,570
So, why would you do something you never did?

336
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,020
I already told you. Now I want to express whatever I want to.

337
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,460
- Be honest with me.
- What?

338
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,870
Do you think I don't know you? I'm sure you feel awkward, embarrassed to death to do these kinds of things.

339
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,980
What are you saying? It's not like that.

340
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,940
What is this?

341
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,420
How was it? It looked natural, right?

342
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,950
Why are you getting stuff all over your face?

343
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,550
What is this?

344
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,300
- Who is it?
- What?

345
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,000
You are not like this at all.

346
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,460
Who taught you this tacky and dirty '90s way of flirting?

347
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,620
It's Thumbs Up, right?

348
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,030
It's awkward to do this and you've just started.

349
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,400
It's so awkward and embarrassing that it's driving me crazy.

350
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,610
Can't we just go back to being friends like our old days?

351
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,790
I don't know if it's convenient for you, but I don't want to!

352
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,670
What should I do?

353
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,020
Anyway, I made a hammock for you so try it out.

354
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,130
So, who told you to make this?

355
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,760
First, lie down. Get up.

356
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,670
Here.

357
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,630
♫ I like it when you look at me from by my side ♫

358
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,280
That's it. That's why I'm telling you to not overdo it. Just do what you normally do.

359
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,060
What do you mean to not overdo it?

360
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,370
My bag.

361
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,240
♫ Remember my love, my eyes, my story ♫

362
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:15,170
Oh! This is really comfortable. So comfortable. It's my first time lying in a hammock.

363
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,410
♫  I only love you ♫

364
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,100
I'll bring some more fruit. Wait a moment.

365
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,640
♫ Oh, oh, oh. Yeah! ♫

366
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,410
♫ Listening to you as you’re in my arms ♫

367
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,030
♫  Having you in my arms ♫

368
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,790
♫  Our eyes, our memories, our hopes ♫

369
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,560
♫ I’ll remember it all ♫

370
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,490
♫ Tonight  ♫

371
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,700
He's not here again? How come there are more times when the management office doesn't have a CEO?

372
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,170
What?

373
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,310
"Anyway, I will win this in the end. Choi Woo Seung."

374
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,470
Choi Woo Seung.

375
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,640
I'm sorry.

376
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,090
You're awesome, Second Place.

377
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,210
Hey, Hyung. Do we have our interns' addresses?

378
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,940
Wow! I didn't know she lives so close.

379
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,100
I could have walked instead.

380
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,030
Choi Woo Seung. If you're going to shower, you can use it first.

381
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,860
Okay.

382
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,330
Wow!

383
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,870
Am I interrupting something?

384
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,450
No, no. I don't know what you're misunderstanding now, but

385
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,600
i-it's not what you're thinking at all!

386
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,720
Aren't you a trainee at my company?

387
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,550
I quit.

388
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,860
Well...

389
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,200
Having a cohabitation history with a woman can be fatal to a trainee, right?

390
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,210
I said it's not like that.

391
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,560
What on earth are you doing here?

392
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,890
Here.

393
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,370
You took my handphone instead of yours by mistake earlier.

394
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,000
What?

395
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,710
Ah, wait a moment.

396
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,840
Hey, Choi Woo Seung! How come you're not answering the phone? What is this?

397
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,990
- You are Thumbs Up.
- Thumbs Up?

398
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,770
You are Slave Underdog.

399
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,380
So you two are "The Double U Crew."

400
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,990
What?

401
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,570
First, I need to catch this punk and have a talk with him.

402
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,490
But, a star is a star after all. He's a popular celebrity. It won't be easy to meet him.

403
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,350
Should I just barge into Yeong Jae's office?

404
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,300
The Best Hit

405
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,610
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
