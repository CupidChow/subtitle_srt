♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,520
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,080
♫ I love you ♫

♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,010
There are 10 messages in the voice mailbox.

14
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,760
Oppa, congratulations on your golden cup.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,620
HEY! You damned little...

16
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,600
I won't let you live. I'll kill...

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,940
- Why don't you pick up...
- You punk!

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,100
Why won't you pick up the calls after causing accidents?

19
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,770
If you were me, would you have picked them up?
-Anyway, listen carefully.

20
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,840
The situation is a lot worse than you think. You're in the studio, right?

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
As soon you receive the message, leave there. Don't stay there.

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,580
Yoo Hyeon Jae!
Opens the door to the future!

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,180
It's not even a joke, what's this?

24
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,490
Gosh.

25
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,760
Gosh, I almost died.

26
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,200
Gosh, I almost died!

27
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,370
Woah!! No!

28
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,810
You want to die! Let's go silently, okay?

29
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,860
What did I do?

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,210
But you didn't know they were in that kind of relationship? You must be really tactless.

31
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,800
I don't understand! I can't understand!

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,300
Just stop!

33
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,340
Even I was surprised, you know?

34
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,330
But that means they dated without you knowing for half a year. How can you not know—

35
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,640
What's wrong with you?

36
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,150
Even I was sad, you know?

37
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,720
But really, your boyfriend and your best friend were like that, but you didn't know—

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,920
Stop, stop it!

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,110
- Stop it, stop it.
- Hey! Look to the front, front!

40
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,330
Stop!

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,130
That was a per... person, right?

42
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,440
Did we hit him! That person, did we hit him?

43
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,280
No, we didn't hit him.

44
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,810
Excuse me, are you okay?

45
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,650
Excuse me!

46
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,500
What did you say?

47
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,340
- What did he say right...
- You are stepping on his hand!

48
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,540
What should we do?

49
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,150
What do you mean? First, call 911.

50
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,960
He died. He died!

51
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,410
Did you see his neck guys? This person has died!

52
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,500
He's sleeping.

53
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,960
Yes? He's s-sleeping?

54
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,290
There's nothing wrong with him. He's just sleeping.

55
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,130
He was hit by a car. How can he sleep?

56
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,920
- He must have been tired.
- Yes?

57
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,030
It seems he's fallen in a deep sleep.

58
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,950
Doctor. We have a patient with a cerebral concussion.

59
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,660
Check his vitals and prep him for an x-ray.

60
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,880
Doctor! What about this person?

61
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,080
Let him sleep for a while. When he wakes, we'll conduct more tests.

62
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,510
He's really sleeping?

63
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,690
He'll be able to wake up, right?

64
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,380
You're saying such useless things! They said he's just sleeping.

65
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,430
Then what about the hospital bills?

66
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,510
I've already called the insurance company to take it over.

67
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,590
Do you know how much our insurance costs will increase? It's all because of her.

68
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,660
But, I definitely didn't seem to hit him. Wouldn't I have known if I had hit him?

69
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,420
Forget it! Take responsibility for this.

70
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,540
Isn't it because you got crazy and made a ruckus while I was driving ?!

71
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,030
Stop, stop it, really.

72
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,860
Let's go home and wait. If something happens the hospital will contact us anyway.

73
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,420
We can't do anything even if we stay here.

74
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,220
Go.

75
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,290
It's chaos. We were in a hurry in the morning

76
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,550
Do you get it now? In this small place, there's nowhere for you to stay.

77
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,430
So don't get any ideas about staying here for long.

78
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,020
I don't plan to. As soon as I find a house, I'm leaving, so don't worry.

79
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,370
Okay, thanks.

80
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,660
He's joking. Be comfortable.

81
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,330
Then, can I sleep here?

82
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,230
Not there, do you want the room?

83
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,870
I don't have any thoughts of stealing your room.

84
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,900
Exactly. We don't even have a room. How uncomfortable would it be for men and women to live together?

85
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,100
- You see her as a woman?
- Then is she a man?

86
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,780
Fine. You really aren't uncomfortable, right?

87
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm a little uncomfortable with the way you look, but I guess I need to deal with that.

88
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,920
Just a minute. The issue is...

89
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,250
I think I have to use it.

90
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,290
While I'm here, I'll pay the rent here.

91
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,540
What? Oh, okay.

92
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,800
I am really doing it. I'll do it as always.

93
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,420
Hey!

94
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,920
Be comfortable while you're here since your officially paying the rent and such.

95
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,880
What's with the stairs? What's up there?

96
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,550
If you clean a bit, you can live here too.

97
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,040
It was used as storage. Wouldn't it be uncomfortable? The ceiling is low too.

98
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,330
I live well in small places. I even lived in a box.

99
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,250
Then let's clean a little, and...

100
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,500
Are you okay?

101
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,660
Yeah, I'm fine.

102
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,410
You're also fine, right?

103
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,650
About what?

104
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,740
Just this and that.

105
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,400
I'm fine. Betrayed by my best friend, left by my boyfriend,

106
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,440
messed up at the police office, and hit a person while driving. Other than that, I'm fine.

107
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,110
I need to study now. The exams are just around the corner.

108
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,440
Oh, right. Don't you need something to change into?

109
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,010
Anything is fine.

110
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,660
Box or here, I can't live with my back straight.

111
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,930
♫ This place ♫

112
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,680
♫ is a little awkward ♫

113
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,410
♫ Like the secret ♫

114
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,200
♫ I tell you ♫

115
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,000
♫ Although love is ♫

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,440
♫ unpredictable ♫

117
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,700
♫ I feel like I'm excited about you ♫

118
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,300
I'm the one who bathed. Why are you without your clothes?

119
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,260
He's been mad about morning exercise.

120
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,050
If you are uncomfortable, you can move out.

121
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,020
I'm not uncomfortable, just displeased.

122
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:22,690
Well, it is well enough that I make displeased.

123
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,120
Ah. This early in the morning, you're making me have a mood swing. Do you want to die?!

124
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,090
Hey! What's with the fight as soon as you wake up? Aren't you even tired of it?

125
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,620
That's what I'm saying.

126
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,420
- Why is he like that?
- Hide! Fast!

127
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,850
Oppa! They are calling you for breakfast!

128
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,580
- I'm coming.
- Do I have to come like this every morning?

129
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,100
I am really getting old because of you.

130
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,680
No matter how old a kindergartener gets, they're just a first grader. I'll wash up and come down soon, so wait downstairs.

131
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,740
Come down quickly.

132
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,240
Is there anyone else here other than you?

133
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,190
What? What are you saying? Who else could be here?

134
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,450
There sure seemed to be someone else.

135
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,060
If not, then okay.

136
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,970
How did she know?

137
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,080
Live about three years in secret. Your body reacts before your mind.

138
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,610
What time are you going to the private academy? We should stop by the hospital in the morning.

139
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's meet at the hospital later. If I head to work, I need to go to her house and get some of my stuff.

140
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,490
But that person seems fine, doesn't he?

141
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,990
Charge to 200-joules. Clear. Shoot!

142
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,930
Charge to 300-joules. Clear. Shoot!

143
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,310
Does it makes sense to move from the company? If you leave, we all are ruined!

144
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,940
I've arranged it so that you receive all the settlements of J2's accounts.

145
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,950
How could you work with them without writing a contract? Do people work in that way these days?

146
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,280
This week's Gayo Top 10 first position is J2!

147
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,940
It's the golden cup.

148
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,220
Please accept this flower bouquet. Aigoo. Also, your colleagues have flower bouquets for you.

149
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,260
I'm disbanding J2 as of today.

150
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,900
What? What did you just say?

151
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,230
I said today's is the last day for J2.

152
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,530
Charge to 350-joules. Clear. Shoot!

153
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,760
What is this?

154
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,680
Is this a hospital?

155
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Why am I at the hospital?

156
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,620
I thought I really passed away.

157
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,470
Unni. It's the first time having a celebrity at our hospital, right?

158
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,450
He seems more handsome in real life, right?

159
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,100
I am a bit of a cap.

160
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,650
His face on camera was actually his ugly version. He looks so much better in real life.

161
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,000
I am quite incredible.

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,620
Right, did you see the reporters outside? What's the big deal about a car accident?

163
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Reporters? Geez.

164
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,500
It looks like I have to leave secretly.

165
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,380
How should I contact Gwang Jae?

166
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,680
What do you do?

167
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,370
Tell them to shift to a personal room quickly.

168
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,100
But about the accident, how did you get into one?

169
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,350
What do you mean how did I get into the accident?

170
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,950
It didn't seem like it would be a situation for an accident. Considering it was a side road, it was quite wide.

171
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,350
Maybe I ran into them on purpose because I didn't want to go to the event.

172
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,760
Hey, you're joking, right?

173
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,840
- It's not, right?
- Let me go.

174
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,890
- It's not. I know it's not.
- Let me go.

175
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,140
You know that my heart is weak.

176
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,560
Since you brought it up, why do I have to go to a congressman's publishing event?

177
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,180
Don't you know that books are the things I hate the most?

178
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,790
Anyway, the CEO will get a bit angry.

179
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,780
It's the CEO.

180
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,450
Anyway, the CEO is not a nobleman.

181
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,650
Quick. My personal room.

182
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,190
He says to come to his office unless your leg is broken. CEO did.

183
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,570
- How did he get into a car accident?
- Not sure. I don't know.

184
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,550
- Was he alone?
- Have you been able to contact his manager?

185
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,530
No, I haven't yet...

186
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,190
Danger
Reporter 1, reporter 2, reporter 3, reporter 4 , reporter 5.

187
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,460
- What kind of wheelchair is like this?
- What are you doing?

188
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,200
- What are you looking at?
- No, no.

189
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,790
- I asked you what you're looking at?
- I said it's nothing.
- Mother!

190
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,090
Mother, please come this way.

191
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,470
Remove your hand.

192
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,600
Can you please not take pictures?

193
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,070
I said to remove your hand.

194
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,840
Is it okay now?

195
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,270
Is this kid joking around?

196
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,770
I said to remove the hand from the door.

197
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,540
Look!

198
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,220
Automatic...

199
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,640
They weren't here because of me?

200
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,780
What kind of situation... Seriously, what is going on?

201
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,930
Perhaps this can't be...

202
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,890
Yes.

203
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,910
Ahjussi Lee Kyung Kyu (from Korean hidden camera show)?

204
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,350
You've been caught on a hidden camera so far. Thank you for your hard work.

205
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,740
I'm sorry.

206
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,110
Everything in the world has changed, hasn't it?

207
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,930
What? Yes.

208
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,930
It's said that even mountains and land can change in 10 years. But 20 years have already passed. Twenty years.

209
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:34,750
- Twenty years?
- Think straight if you want to get back alive and safely.

210
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,480
But who are you?

211
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,300
Yes, that's right. Let's meet and have a look at it before you return home.

212
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,680
We don't know when we'll see you again if you go in.

213
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,500
Okay.

214
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,290
What is he?

215
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,210
The center of the Korean Wave

216
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,810
Star Punch's Stars performance showcase

217
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,110
The largest music concert on earth

218
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,870
2017 Star Punch Summer Concert

219
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,910
On June 30, 2017 at Monster Hall

220
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,130
2017?

221
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,430
The Best Hit

222
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,160
What are you doing? Where are you going? You should have just turned left?

223
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,830
I have somewhere to go before we go to the hospital.

224
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,530
Where? You... No way!

225
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,990
There are probably a lot of things to pack. How can Woo Seung bring all of that by herself?

226
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,900
Bro, stop. Why do I have to help that annoying girl?

227
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,360
Hey, who told you to help? Just wait a bit downstairs.

228
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
Gosh, I don't want to. I don't want to, I don't want to!

229
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,530
Gosh, I really really don't want to!

230
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,160
It seems that I need to fix that seat.

231
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,880
What now? What's going on?

232
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,790
You called me yesterday. Did something happen?

233
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,780
What do you mean? There's nothing like that.

234
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,670
I had a dream and now I can't get rid of this weird feeling.

235
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,480
Do you know that I often have dreams that are predictive of the near future?

236
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,970
I'm busy right now. If you're going to say nonsense, hang up.

237
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,900
You were in my dream, but this fly or bee of some sort

238
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,220
kept stinging your lips. Not even once, but three times!

239
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,510
- You. No matter where you go, be careful of your lips.
- I'm hanging up.

240
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,930
What kind of dream is she dreaming? Why is she acting like a mom all of a sudden?

241
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,350
Hey, why are you here?

242
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,640
You said you were packing. Let's do it together.

243
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,670
What kind of girl doesn't have a lot of things?

244
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,470
I... I've lived off of people since I was little.

245
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,780
Having a lot of things just creates more mental stress.

246
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,300
Well, what would someone who's lived as well as you know?

247
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,410
Live well, my butt.

248
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,440
These books. I just need to put them in here, right?

249
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,300
Yes, in the yellow box.

250
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,030
Hey, I'm saying this just in case. Don't misunderstand.

251
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,010
These tears are just caused by my blocked tear ducts.

252
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,590
It's coming out of my eyes, but it's the same thing as spit.

253
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,540
- Did I say otherwise?
- I've passed the age of crying over losing a boyfriend to a best friend.

254
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,230
Think about it. Human relationships that would've disappeared anyway...

255
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,640
Not just one, but two got fixed. That's something to be thankful for.

256
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,740
- You're strangely cool.
What do you mean "strangely"? If you say cool, it's me, Choi Woo Seung.

257
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
Why are you packing things like that?

258
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,910
We bought all of these with shared money. Half of them are mine.

259
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,860
I bought this with her too.

260
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,360
And this.

261
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,650
- And this, but—
- Forget it. Just let her have it.

262
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,610
Have what? It's enough for her to take that punk. What else does she get to have?

263
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,700
I'm not leaving any single thing that belongs to me. I'm taking everything that's mine.

264
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,310
Here.

265
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:40,510
My bear. Since I got this with her, half of it is mine!

266
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,090
Laptop. We got it at the chicken event. Together...

267
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,210
We split the chicken price in half, then half of that is mine too.

268
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,370
- Even so, how would you split laptop—
- Like this. Half and half.

269
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,130
Oh, you split it.

270
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,540
What? Why? What's wrong?

271
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,240
Ugh, 2017.

272
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,930
What in the world happened?

273
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,250
What is this?

274
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,540
Excuse me. Where is the public telephone?

275
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,620
There was definitely a public telephone. Where could it be?

276
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,210
I'm sure it's here somewhere, but that...

277
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,880
Right. Go over there. Try the back door.

278
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,260
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yes.

279
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:32,800
What kind of public telephone is nowhere to be seen?

280
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,820
That guy, he's so tacky.

281
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,170
Tacky
Completely

282
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,850
- Where did he get such clothes?
- He's such a fashion terrorist.

283
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,570
- Is he from a village?
- Hey, they don't wear clothes like that in a village these days.

284
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,030
He's a visual terror.

285
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,730
- What's with him?
- Why is he like that?

286
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,550
Seriously, what the heck? Tacky?

287
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,000
Me? Yoo Hyeon Jae?

288
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:42,040
As expected. You did well, Defconn. Is this for real?

289
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,600
Excuse me.

290
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:53,290
Excuse me, do you know where the public telephone is?

291
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,880
Public telephone?

292
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,530
Oh, you don't have battery, huh?

293
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,400
Battery?

294
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,000
- Then you can use it to make one phone call.
- What?

295
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,360
No, that's not it. I'm asking for a public telephone.

296
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,290
- Yeah, so here it is.
- No, to call.

297
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,770
Exactly, here it is a hand phone.

298
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,030
- A handphone?
- Yeah.

299
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,890
Handphone. Then it's a phone made of a hand?

300
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,040
Huh, I got a call coming in..

301
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,230
What's up?

302
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,170
Okay then. Let me just use it for one call. Your handphone.

303
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,090
It's a celebrity phone, but sure, go ahead.

304
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,670
Use it then.

305
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,810
Hello?

306
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,700
Right, but how do you press the numbers for this?

307
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,770
What are you doing?

308
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:03,140
Call. Hand. Phone.

309
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:10,450
Hey, manager, why are you so late? I met a weird person!

310
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,080
Testicle friend... friend... friend

311
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,200
Forget it. It was an accident.

312
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,410
Who doesn't make mistakes in this world?

313
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,360
- But it wasn't a mistake.
- Really?

314
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,340
Well, what I'm doing right now is a mistake.

315
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,820
No, but what's wrong with Noona Hwa Jeong? Why would she do such a difficult quiz on the radio? Aish, really.

316
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,360
I get angrier the more I think about it.

317
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,740
- It's because I'm ignorant.
- Ignorance is what's wrong!

318
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,970
No. Is ignorance a sin? You are innocent.

319
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,200
Oh! It's idiot Hong Bo Hee!

320
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,570
Oh, wow! I told you she is the ajumma from the bread store.

321
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,860
- Oh, she is the bread woman. It's awesome!
- These little girls... How come you speak to an elder like that?

322
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,960
Ajumma, you were really awesome on the filmed radio program yesterday.

323
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,920
Filmed radio? What's that?

324
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,290
It's a visual radio program. She's all over social media. She's really no joke!

325
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,360
- Look at this!
- What is it?

326
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,160
What is the four-character idiom for understanding each other's feelings without saying it outright?

327
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,050
Telepathy? Oh! Testicle friends. Idiot?

328
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,100
She's so funny.

329
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,770
Gosh, never mind. Get rid of it! What's with all this fuss over nothing?

330
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,520
It has a lot of views. I'm not kidding.

331
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,920
Hey, what are you doing? We're here!

332
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,980
Choi Woo Seung!

333
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,130
Can you sleep right now?

334
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,470
Let it be. It seems she wasn't able to sleep last night.

335
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:04,120
- Did someone sleep?
- Yes, you did. Snoring and everything.

336
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,220
It seems the two of us will have to go to the hospital by ourselves.

337
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,390
- Disappeared?
- Yes. He was here in the morning, but it seems he got discharged.

338
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:32,130
- Is there no contact information either?
- No, there's nothing like that either.

339
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:39,460
- He's not going to show up and ask us for money, right?
- No way.

340
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,570
It's weird that he left without telling us! Ugh, I have a bad feeling.

341
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,610
That's true. Where could he have gone?

342
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,230
The number you called is not a valid phone number.

343
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,430
Please call after checking again

344
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,760
My home phone is...

345
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:20,530
- The number you called is not a valid phone number. Please call again after checking. 
- What's wrong with this?

346
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:25,940
- The number you've dialed is not in service, please check the number...< br>- Then, the office phone...

347
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,050
The number you called is not a valid phone number. Please call again after checking...

348
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,310
Monster Hall
On Friday June 30, 2017 at 6 p.m.
Sponsor: Star Punch Entertainment

349
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,470
Then are you saying I came 20 years into the future? How?

350
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,980
Then, at that moment... gosh!

351
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,510
Does that make sense?

352
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,140
Yoo Hyeon Jae. Let's get a hold of yourself.

353
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,430
Even if you're caught by a tiger, if you still have some common sense you'll overcome it.

354
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:21,220
What can you overcome? I can't! I can't!

355
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,680
Hey, Hyeon Jae. Hey, Yoo Hyeon Jae. Let's get washed and leave.

356
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,600
One, two, three!

357
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,400
What would you have done without me?

358
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,000
Right. Let's try this. I need to go and find Gwang Jae first.

359
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,590
Which direction should I take to get to the studio?

360
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,530
Is that the main road?

361
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,230
- Why didn't you pick up when you're always on your phone?
- When did I only use my phone?

362
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,530
I did everything, and you missed the event. Do you know how important that event was?

363
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,500
What can I do when there was an accident?

364
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,960
It's not like you broke your leg. If you made a promise, you should've at least shown your face.

365
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,670
I'm sure CEO made the promise. I never made a promise like that.

366
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,350
Are you going through puberty? All you need to express is how sorry you are.

367
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,860
I'm sorry...

368
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,760
- Can I go?
- Where are you going? Sit down.

369
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:35,190
You've been on a rollercoaster, right? Going up is hard, but going down... Gosh.

370
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,850
It happens in a moment. I'm telling you this as your senior.

371
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:46,030
Going up wasn't that hard.

372
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,190
Gosh, you could just say sorry, but you just make people madder, don't you?

373
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,170
I'm sorry. I can go now, right?

374
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,850
Perhaps, you aren't getting any other ideas, right?

375
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,310
We are like a family. We can't have any secrets between us. Keep that in mind.

376
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,500
Oppa, why are you not answering the phone?

377
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,160
Oppa?

378
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,020
- I wasn't not picking up--
You could just say sorry, but you always—

379
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,270
- Oh my gosh. Hi, MJ.
- Hi, President.

380
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,940
Excuse me, I was in the middle of an important meeting with him.

381
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,400
Are you the only one who's busy? I'm busy too.

382
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,900
- Gosh, so...
- I can go now, right?

383
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,100
What's this about World Villa?

384
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,730
Why do you need that much money to do something I don't know about?

385
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,400
Well, that's something I'll explain later.

386
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:51,110
How many times do I have to tell you that we can't keep secrets from one another?

387
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:57,000
CEO, you shouldn't have secrets. We're a family.

388
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,040
That little...

389
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,940
Gosh, whatever. There's no reason to do that anymore.

390
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,000
Jay-2

391
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,600
Hey, no way. It can't be.

392
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,090
But this is too similar!

393
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,120
Ah, yeah. Even this is here. That happened when I parked it.

394
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:03,190
Ay, it's probably not. Why would my car be here?

395
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,570
Gosh, it's my car!

396
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,170
Is it really my car? Why is this here?

397
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,300
What in the world is going on?

398
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,120
How come you ended up in this bad state?

399
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,680
Mal Sook, eat a lot. It's delicious, right?

400
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,090
- What about Bo Hee?
- She has no appetite.

401
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,140
What's the matter with the noodle ghost (someone who loves eating noodles)?

402
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:08,010
It serves you right. Why did you take her on such a radio show?

403
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,430
I heard she wanted to go on "Burning Youth" or "Flaming Youth" or whatever it's called, you punk!

404
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,340
Can I eat ajumma's noodles?

405
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,930
Yes, you can eat them.

406
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:25,060
No, there is this rascal director who wants me to find Hyeon Jae if I want to get Bo Hee on a TV program.

407
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,490
Hey! Is that rascal crazy or what?!

408
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:33,070
Grandpa, if those are leftovers, can I have them?

409
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,800
They're not leftovers. I'm in the middle of eating.

410
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,240
It's KBC, right? Director Yoon is still the chief of the station.

411
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,500
Director Yoon and I are like blood brothers. Sworn brothers.

412
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,890
Then I... I should give him a call.

413
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,750
It's been a long while since Director Yoon passed away.

414
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,940
Die? He died? When?

415
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,980
Just eat your noodles.

416
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,810
Gosh, these punks. If they're going to die, they should tell me they're going to die before they die.

417
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,100
He died...

418
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,830
Choi Woo Seung. That sly girl.

419
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,530
I'm going to kill her!

420
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,930
CHOI WOO SEUNG!

421
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,240
♫ Yeah. ♫

422
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,900
Gosh, I need to know where everything is.

423
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,600
You're saying this is Seoul, right?

424
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,700
Gosh, I shouldn't have come this way. Where am I going?

425
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,070
Gosh, what is this? We haven't arrived at the hospital yet?

426
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,610
Stop the car! Stop the car! I said stop the car!

427
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,410
Hey, what are you doing? Who are you?

428
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,660
I said to hurry and stop the car!

429
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,770
Gosh! Hey! That just went in my mouth!

430
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,100
- Hey, let go!
- We're going to get into an accident at this rate!

431
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,850
Ah, really! I don't know who you are, but stay still.

432
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,690
This is your final chance.

433
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,080
You... you can't do that. Put that down already!

434
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,860
- So stop the car!
I mean, how can I stop the car here?

435
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:24,470
Hey! Look, look, look, look, look!

436
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,190
♫ On the rainbow colored street, people smile ♫

437
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,160
♫ You make me smile as well ♫

438
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,680
♫ The flowers flutter with joy in the sweet breeze ♫

439
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,490
♫ Greeting everyone step by step ♫

440
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,280
♫ Beautiful, beautiful ♫

441
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,040
♫ I’m happy with you here ♫

442
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,290
♫ Beautiful  ♫

443
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,160
What are you doing—?

444
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,300
The Best Hit
