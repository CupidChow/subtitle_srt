Let's go.

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,420
Where are you going?

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,910
- Why?
- I want to go too.

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,460
Where do you think we're going?

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,180
Wherever.

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,350
- Okay.
- No.

20
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,110
I only promised it to Woo Seung.

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,620
Well, you're right, but...

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,180
You'll get busier once you start working.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,860
It's the weekend and also...

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,210
I want to go out. I have to get out of here.

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,510
I'm really curious about some things now.

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,620
He'll also get busier once he starts his part-time job. Let him join us just for today.

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,110
Okay!

- It's thumbs up!
- I told you to not say thumbs up.

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,460
- He's crazy.
- Ah, why is he taking this long?

♫ Beautiful. Beautiful ♫

38
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,240
This hair salon is great.

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,250
You became a man.

40
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,470
♫ Beautiful. Beautiful ♫

41
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,920
Should I cut my hair?

♫ Beautiful ♫

44
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,600
Hey! This fridge is very big.

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,680
Hey! Hey, don't touch it. You'll have to work here forever if anything happens to it.

46
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,340
I can remember everything now. Who I am...

47
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,980
There was one like this in my house.

48
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,180
Do you really remember?

49
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,260
I came from the future.

50
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,190
What?

51
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,280
I came back in time to meet you guys.

52
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,110
What's wrong with him?

53
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,380
You don't believe me?

54
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,210
This is the fridge I brought from the future.

55
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,760
Fridge, let me know today's schedule.

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,770
You have no schedule today.

57
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,170
Awesome, right?

58
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,200
Hey, what should I eat today?

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,080
Please give me the recipe for shrimp fried rice.

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,000
The shrimp recipe, I will start.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,760
One more thing.

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,540
Please devein the shrimp, and remove the shell and head...

63
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,650
Isn't it fun? Isn't it absolutely amazing? Yay!

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,910
Aigoo. What an idiot.

65
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,260
Hey, I'm hungry. I'm hungry!

66
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,550
What's the matter?

67
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,690
Oh, it's 50 cents.

68
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,510
Follow me for a second.

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,800
- I'll do it. Come out.
- No, no.

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,880
I saw the trick before.

71
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,450
Here. Like this...

72
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,520
What?

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,180
Like this. Yay!

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,010
- Isn't it great, right?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,700
Nice to meet you.

76
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,180
When did you say it was your birthday?

77
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,920
It's July 13. Why?

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,790
Is that so?

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,400
Then think of it as your birthday present.

80
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,710
Hey. Thank you.

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,150
When you were in high school, what was your student number?

82
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,660
Why do you ask?

83
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,260
Well, I was wondering if you went to high school.

84
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,770
You seriously!

85
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,380
Worry about yourself. You don't even know who you are.

86
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,600
Why would you dare ask someone else's student number?

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,170
That's right. You walked around the streets with us today. By any chance, do you remember anything?

88
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,740
No, nothing. Not at all. Are you satisfied?

89
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,500
What is this? Where have you been without me?

90
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,720
You three guys, seem to eat well and have a good time without me these days.

91
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,790
I'll save these and those.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,850
- What is that?
- What?

93
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,310
Here. These items are going to be a hit.

94
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,890
I almost missed them for being stuck in this room.

95
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,200
There's nothing new or interesting about those.

96
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,050
Hey, Thumbs Up. I think you're kind of weird.

97
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,760
What are you saying again?

98
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,630
You like old dramas like "Justice Pao" and "Jealousy."

99
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,150
It was your first time eating a triangular kimbap.

100
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,310
It's a bit uncomfortable for you to wear those tacky clothes.

101
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,600
You know nothing about the world.

102
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,980
So what?

103
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,530
From what I see, you are...

104
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,710
I'm what?

105
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,950
You're not a person from here.

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,180
- What?
- You...

107
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,650
You're an overseas Korean. I'm 100 percent sure.

108
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,170
Instead of going to the police, let's go and look for some embassies.

109
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,160
You know what I mean, Bro?

110
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,950
- Yes.
- Yes!

111
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,930
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

112
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,190
- Yo!
- Great!

113
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,270
- Yeah!
- Great then!

114
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,860
- You're crazy.
- An embassy...

115
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,730
Teddy bear, you have a new friend.

116
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,000
- A road manager?
- You said you wanted to make money.

117
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,420
Did you forget?

118
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm the great Yoo Hyeon Jae, who has been heard and released albums all over the Republic of Korea until recently.

119
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,230
How come now I'm supposed to drive for someone else?

120
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,040
Be quiet. Hey, just worry about how to make ends meet now.

121
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,430
While working as a part-timer at the bakery, do this in your spare time too. This is the schedule for today.

122
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,650
Hey! How much are you going to give me?

123
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,160
Gwang Jae. I'm ready.

124
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,150
Oh, is that so? Are you feeling better?

125
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes. I'm fine.

126
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,860
Let's go, let's go. Get in.

127
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,820
"Are you feeling better?" Yuk.

128
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,410
World Entertainment

129
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,340
Are you the new manager?

130
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,600
This oppa is really handsome!

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,470
I'm not your oppa.

132
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,640
Have you already started working?

133
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,950
Yes.

134
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,270
- Where are we going again?
- I heard it's a truce village in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). It's in Paju.

135
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,870
- Okay. Oppa, I have the address with me. Let's go!
- Let's go then.

136
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,090
Right. Wait a moment. My earrings.

137
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,250
- Ah.
- Hurry up.

138
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,480
Go get it!

139
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,250
- I wish I could go to Paju too.
- Get in then.

140
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,200
I have to go to work too.

141
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,210
Forget it. If you go to Paju, there's a really delicious jjajangmyeon (black bean noodle) restaurant.

142
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,590
- Oh. Where is it?
- You wouldn't know even if I told you.

143
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,270
New Oppa, are you good at driving?

144
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,160
Can't you see it? I'm great at it.

145
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,720
New Oppa, how long will it take?

146
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
With my driving skills? It won't take that long.

147
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,630
Tell me where it is. I really like jjajangmyeon.

148
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,450
I remembered it was at a very random place.

149
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,290
But, it may not taste good to you.

150
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,760
Hey. Where on earth there is a bad jjajangmyeon?

151
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,520
When I was very young, it was the last time my real dad bought me something before he left for somewhere far away.

152
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,110
As a young girl back then, I only kept looking at the fried egg on top of the jjajangmyeon...

153
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,580
I was wondering when I could eat it. That's all I was thinking about then.

154
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,250
That was the last memory I had with my real father.

155
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,710
Anyway, I was going to visit that place again but I couldn't find it no matter how hard I looked for it.

156
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,530
Oh. Well, if you've been there only once when you were very young, how can you get there again?

157
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,840
It was unusual. I just stayed by the side of the road.

158
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,420
If you go a little further from there, I heard it's near North Korea so it was somewhere remote and far.

159
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,910
Ah, seriously. She has so many stories.

160
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,380
Yes, yes. I think it will take about 30 more minutes.

161
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,510
Yes, I understand. I'll see you there.

162
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,180
I thought it was right to reject the offer at first.

163
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,390
- But, there are a lot of incoming calls from reporters.
- Really?

164
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,340
You don't look well.

165
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,590
I'm fine.

166
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,040
I just hope we can pay off all our debts with this.

167
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,930
So I hope you don't suffer because of our debt anymore.

168
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,100
Hey. What suffering? If it's hard, you're the one suffering.

169
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,750
I was looking through the old photos during the day, but there wasn't a single picture of you.

170
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,870
When I think about it, you used to carry a camera with you all the time to only take pictures of us.

171
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,930
But you never took any pictures of yourself. I felt sad and bad about that.

172
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,380
Hey. When you were younger, you were so cute, right?

173
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,720
Aigoo. What cute?

174
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,540
What was so cute about me?

175
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,600
You can do and move around the same as I mentioned to you before.

176
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,940
You can do the same as he mentioned earlier.

177
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,340
Most of them are chroma key shots, so you just follow the director's instructions carefully.

178
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,230
Mostly chroma key shots. Follow the director's instructions.

179
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,400
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,010
Ah, yes.

181
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,940
Earlier, I saw the storyboard so there's nothing special about it.

182
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,680
You just have to pretend to be flying.

183
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,750
Okay.

184
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,810
Is Dragon Belch here? Dragon Belch.

185
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,470
Excuse me, Director. She's already on standby there.

186
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,370
I see.

187
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,470
No, but how that dare that jerk...!

188
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,400
Hey, he didn't know I was here, so calm down.

189
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,580
Hello!

190
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,620
- Hello.
- Aigoo. Ha Soo Yeong.

191
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,350
You said you were going to be late today, but you came right on time.

192
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,700
Am I shooting this with Soo Yeong?

193
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,370
I didn't know.

194
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,470
Ah, then, is Ha Soo Yeong the main character?

195
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,200
Oh, Unni!

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,810
It's been a really long time since I last saw you.

197
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,950
What's wrong with her clothes? Why is she coming this way?

198
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,490
It's been more than 15 years since we saw each other, right?

199
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,590
Yes. I think so.

200
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,780
- Let's do a good job today.
- Okay. I'll take good care of you.

201
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,620
From time to time I get together with the girls these days. Why aren't you coming to our meetings?

202
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,320
What? Right. I should go now.

203
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,440
When we get together, we talk about you sometimes.

204
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,840
Many people used to talk about us so much, before. Do you remember, right?

205
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,450
- Did they?
- Yes, they did!

206
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,770
Secondary school students used to fight over the two of us.

207
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,200
They'd argue which of us was the real Pure Fairy.

208
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,230
At that time, I was very jealous of you.

209
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,360
Were you?

210
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,000
Unni, what's on your face? What's going on?

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,660
Ah, the male students, from that time, should see her face now. What a show.

212
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,450
She has pickled radish on her eyes.

213
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,230
My gosh. I think my makeup will be erased. What should I do?

214
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,530
- Ah, Bo Hee.
- Yes.

215
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,230
Oh, you look great. It feels nice.

216
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,460
Gimbap.

217
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,470
Nice!

218
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,300
It's much cuter than I thought.

219
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,490
Really?

220
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,400
Do you want some water?

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,990
No. I can't go to the bathroom wearing this. I don't think I should drink any water.

222
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,820
Okay. Let's hurry up and then leave.

223
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,670
Ready. Action!

224
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,350
Cut! It's an NG.

225
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,370
It doesn't look good.

226
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,340
Hey, gimbap. No, Hong Bo Hee.

227
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,650
Let's make it a bit more realistic. Okay?

228
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,610
I'm sorry!

229
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,940
Unni, be comfortable. Take it easy.

230
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,350
Okay.

231
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,880
We'll do it again.

232
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,240
Ready. Action!

233
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,630
Cut! It's an NG!

234
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,630
Don't make it look like a joke.

235
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
Ready. Action!

237
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,410
It's an NG!

238
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,440
- Cut! It's an NG.
- I'm sorry.

239
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,310
- Cut! It's an NG.
- I'm sorry.

240
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,010
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,410
Cut! It's an NG.

242
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,950
Ah, what a headache. Why can't she do this right?

243
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,760
Hey, you should do it instead.

244
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,200
- Should I do it then?
- Do you want to do it?

245
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Director, I'm sorry but...

246
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,510
This feels so good. This does feel good.

247
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,100
It'll be okay, right?

248
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,400
What to do?

249
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,190
What should I do?

250
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,230
What is it?

251
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,600
Ah, Soo Yeong just heard she has to go film some extra shots for her drama and went there for a while. She'll be back soon.

252
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,550
Aigoo. What? Then do I have to wait for her wearing this?

253
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,630
I asked around and she said she'll be back soon so they think it's better for you to just wait like this.

254
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,020
- Is that so?
- She'll be right back.

255
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,010
They said she'd be here soon.

256
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,910
Lie down.

257
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,650
- Aigoo. That hurts.
- Sorry.

258
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,610
World Entertainment

259
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,980
You're late. Does an intern work overtime?

260
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,510
How does it feel to be jobless? What did you do all day?

261
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,190
For a change, I was just doing nothing after a long time.

262
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,840
Ah, I'm going to make some ramyeon.

263
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,780
Stay here. I'll boil some ramyeon for you.

264
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,470
♡ Pretty Do Hye Ri ♡

265
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,460
♡ Pretty Do Hye Ri ♡

266
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,100
What?

267
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,820
It's a call from Pretty Do Hye Ri.

268
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,590
This is not how I saved her name on my phone.

269
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,960
What are you doing? Aren't you picking it up?

270
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,500
So much fun.

271
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,150
Hello?

272
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,920
- Why do you keep calling me?
- Did you really quit?

273
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,000
You didn't even tell me about it.

274
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,930
Why would I tell you about that? Never mind. Let's stop.

275
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,900
I'm hanging up.

276
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,270
♡ Pretty Do Hye Ri ♡

277
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,220
So that was Do Hye Ri?

278
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,070
What do you mean?

279
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,600
"Someone I've known for a long time. You know her too."

280
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,530
It's not her.

281
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,840
You can just be honest with me.

282
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,590
Between friends, there is really no such thing as a secret.

283
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,760
- It's not like that.
- What do you mean no?

284
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,300
I can easily tell it's a lover's quarrel.

285
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,560
What is it? Did you guys fight? What's the problem? You can tell me anything.

286
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,780
- It's not like that!
- What?

287
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,960
I said it's not like that. If you wish that to be true, then okay. I got it.

288
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,560
I'll consider going out with Do Hye Ri. Are you happy now?

289
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,210
Make your ramyeon by yourself.

290
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,070
Why do you keep bringing up Do Hye Ri? Do Hye Ri...

291
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,650
Hey!

292
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,130
Here. Have some kimbap.

293
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,910
Even if you don't have an appetite, you should eat something. I think this will take a long while.

294
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,520
Thank you.

295
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,460
They said she'd be back soon after the shoot.

296
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,920
Ah, why has she been filming during all this time?

297
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,550
Anyway, Ha Soo Yeong has always been so rude.

298
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,250
You're struggling a lot, right?

299
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,120
How much longer should we wait?

300
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,660
- Why? Do you need to use the bathroom?
- No.

301
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,110
Then, eat first.

302
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,040
Gwang Jae, water. Give me some water.

303
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,470
Water? Wait. Just wait a moment.

304
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,020
Unni, are you alright? You're sweating.

305
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,230
Yes. Well, this costume is a little hot. I'm fine.

306
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,940
Ah, it's so hot in here.

307
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,790
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,170
Oh. Soo Yeong! You're here?

309
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,570
Hey, You're a little bit late.

310
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,600
Today's scene was an important one so it was much harder to get into character and convey the feelings than I thought.

311
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,500
Hey, Ha Soo Yeong!

312
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,740
Please come here.

313
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,070
Pardon?

314
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,900
Unni, you have been waiting a lot, right?

315
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,710
Because of you, you made many people wait for nothing.

316
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,130
If you thought that it would take a long time like this, wouldn't you have told us in advance?

317
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,590
No. It's not like that Unni.

318
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,610
I am not your unni. I'm your sunbae.

319
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,200
And I debuted a year before you did.

320
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,900
Hey! What? What's this situation now?

321
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,950
Ah, seriously. I've had enough of this. That's too much.

322
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,300
You're only a kind of decoration that doesn't make any difference.

323
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,500
Excuse me. Are you proud of being old?

324
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,950
- Hey! What are you doing to her?
- Ah, seriously.

325
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,070
- Hey, Get up.
- Why are you being like this? Stop.

326
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,550
I'll let you have it today!

327
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,400
- I'm really not holding up today.
- Bring it on!

328
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,560
- Come on, bring it on!
- What? Don't back down!

329
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,190
- Kimbap!
- Kimbap!

330
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,960
Bo Hee! Bo Hee, are you okay?

331
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,490
- Get an ambulance. Get an ambulance!
- Hey, look here.

332
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,210
Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance quickly!

333
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,640
Ambulance

334
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,580
She has a slight fever, but you don't have to worry about it.

335
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,720
Ah, yes. Thank you.

336
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,420
It's my fault.

337
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,460
I really get zero points as a manager. Zero points.

338
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,240
What are you saying?

339
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,830
To be honest, I wasn't ready to pass out.

340
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,550
What?

341
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,040
I was afraid you'd get beaten up if I just watched.

342
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,790
Why would I get beaten up?

343
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,980
His physique is no joke at all.

344
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,760
Earlier, I heard them talking in the dressing room...

345
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,430
What did she say it was?

346
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,590
She learned mixed martial arts. Her manager learned it too.

347
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,360
So what?

348
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,470
Originally... Among the ancient fighters, the scariest one was...

349
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,640
the one had learned to fight on the streets like me.

350
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,000
It hurts.

351
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,350
Hey! I thought you guys were funny but you two are good at singing.

352
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,310
Exactly, exactly. Thumbs up!

353
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,860
But, are you going to keep talking down to your noonas?

354
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,590
What?

355
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,220
I got it. I understand, Noonas.

356
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,370
As of today, I'm going to be your FS.

357
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,370
FS?

358
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,150
Faithful Servant!

359
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,640
You're cute. Cute! Cute!

360
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,590
Cute!

361
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,150
He's cute!

362
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,630
But, When our manager isn't around, it's really comfortable riding this car, right?

363
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,410
Hey. I've been driving since I was young...

364
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,650
The Great Wall restaurant

365
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,000
Wow! This is really a random place for a Chinese restaurant.

366
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,940
The Great Wall restaurant

367
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,440
Excuse me.

368
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,880
- Welcome.
- Are you still open?

369
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,620
Because I'm still selling, the doors aren't locked yet.

370
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,140
- Sit down. What would you like?
- No.

371
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:08,660
By any chance do you put a fried egg on top of the jjajangmyeon?

372
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,050
Originally, you're supposed to eat jjajangmyeon with a fried egg on top.

373
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,920
- I see.
- Sit down.

374
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,410
Okay. That's thumbs up!

375
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,520
Wow! I got goosebumps.

376
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,200
Hey! I dared to get in luckily.

377
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,810
Then... By any chance, can you pack it for me?

378
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,000
My friend... I must take it packed with me.

379
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,730
Then, that's fine.

380
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,760
That's thumbs up!

381
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,170
You worked hard today.

382
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,760
Yeah, right.

383
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:08,850
Thank you. You're always by my mom's side, protecting her.

384
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,940
I am pretty good at staying next to her.

385
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,160
Also, I'm sorry. I disappointed you.

386
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,150
You're all grown up, Lee Ji Hoon. You now know how to be stubborn.

387
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,880
I was always like that.

388
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,270
Why did it have to be Young Jae's company?

389
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,780
That angered me the most.

390
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,220
That wasn't your fault.

391
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,960
I'm quite narrow-minded.

392
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,700
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,710
You should stop holding it in, too.

394
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,640
How could you stay silent for three years?

395
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,510
Looking back, it's all my fault.

396
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:11,380
I stopped you from saying "Mom" to your mom in public,

397
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,920
and didn't approve of you singing and dancing. You must have been sad.

398
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm not even your biological dad. What right did I have, right?

399
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,960
It wasn't like that.

400
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,340
Back then, I just thought that was the best way to protect you.

401
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,300
When I thought about the hurt you would receive from this industry—

402
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,380
Father.

403
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,720
At first, I thought everything would get better if I was patient.

404
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,130
Your mom's comeback, my business, your career.

405
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,340
I thought I should be a little more patient.

406
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,890
After pushing everything back, I missed all the good moments.

407
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,920
I'm going to quit being a trainee.

408
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,900
I don't think this is the right path for me.

409
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,720
I think it was a mistake to get started.

410
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,940
- I'll go back to studying—
- No.

411
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,300
You have to do what you want when the time is right.

412
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,980
It doesn't matter what you think will happen in the future.

413
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,710
ID Card
Lee Ji Hoon

414
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,900
Even if you do resemble me, don't resemble me in this sort of way.

415
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,800
You shouldn't regret things as I did.

416
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,200
Do what you want, say what you want.

417
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,540
That's how you should live, okay?

418
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,550
Okay.

419
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,460
This shot is for our family.

420
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,010
And this shot is for Ji Hoon, who should not live like us.

421
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,140
I'm sorry, Father.

422
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,450
He gets impetuous exactly like me.

423
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,220
Was I talking to a wall? Goodness.

424
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,840
Goodness.

425
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,390
You're a hundred times worse than the president.

426
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,050
I'm sorry. The black bean noodles don't taste good if they're soggy.

427
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,330
Good work today, both of you.

428
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,280
MJ is signing off for today!

429
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,620
Hey!

430
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,130
♫ The road that leads me to you shine like sunshine ♫

431
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,080
♫ My heart is beating ♫

432
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,060
♫ I want to confess to you today ♫

433
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,090
What's up?

434
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,600
Where are you? Hurry over here.

435
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,130
I stopped by the convenience store. What happened?

436
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,590
Just get over here now.

437
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,790
Now!

438
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,630
Now, now, now! Get here now!

439
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,150
Get here quickly! Now!

440
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,330
♫ I think of you ♫

441
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,290
She's going to be so surprised when she sees this.

442
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,690
♫ Beautiful ♫

443
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,970
It got so soggy already.

444
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,660
♫ I’m happy with you here ♫

445
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,430
♫ Beautiful. Beautiful ♫

446
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,160
♫ So that you can hear ♫

447
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,440
Her height and weight.

448
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,230
Would she be about 130?

449
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,550
130... and her weight is...

450
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,200
Oh.

451
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,210
Last four digits of her number...

452
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,540
Her birthday?

453
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,100
Oh!

454
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,390
Thumbs up!

455
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,490
Okay.

456
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,740
Hey! Thumbs Up!

457
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,940
What happened?

458
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,340
Did you cause trouble again?

459
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,300
What's wrong? What's going on?

460
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,650
Choi Woo Seung.

461
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,950
Did something happen?

462
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,240
You asked me before.

463
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,730
- Ask you what?
- About the person I like.

464
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:53,070
I want to answer that question.

465
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,920
No, I will tell you.

466
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,130
What are you talking about? That's so random. Let's talk inside.

467
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,700
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

468
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,260
There's someone I've liked for a long time.

469
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,270
She's someone you know.

470
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,320
♫  Some day, fly fly fly ♫

471
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,640
She's you. You. Choi Woo Seung.

472
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,720
You're the person I like.

473
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,990
Since you were Park Woo Seung, Yoon Woo Seung,

474
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:32,510
and now Choi Woo Seung. Not as a friend, but as a woman.

475

♫ Light in the sky ♫

476
