00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,610
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,480
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,410
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,550
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,030
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,260
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,870
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,560
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,060
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,390
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,120
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,450
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,610
Self-study

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,600
At some point our goals have turned from passing the exam to escaping from this place.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,350
It's not that we're studying to become something.

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,680
It's because we're scared of ending up being nothing that we have to study.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,520
We don't study to gain something.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,220
We study because we don't want to lose anything anymore.

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,020
We don't study to pass an exam. We study because it's the only thing we know how to do.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,300
I'm sorry but your thoughts are too noisy and it bothers me.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,800
Please be quiet.

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,130
I'm sorry that I'm a bit late.

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,220
Oh, you're here.

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,320
Boss, did something happen?

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,280
We've been shut down.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,240
- What?
- It wasn't a profitable business anyway.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,340
I'm just going to close the shop.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,100
If you need anything, just take it.

29
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,840
Think of it as your severance pay.

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,810
Hey, I was joking around. What's with you?

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,070
Why are you so early? Don't you have your part-time job today?

32
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,840
I got fired. Again.

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,530
Anyway, You're very good at getting fired.

34
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,170
Oh, well, that's a talent. It's a talent, after all.

35
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,760
You're right. I'm lucky.

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,780
You would need to do something to get fired.

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,720
Look at her.

38
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,390
I really can't be friends with her anymore.

39
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,680
Since we're feeling down, should we have a party for the first time in a while?

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,220
I want to make up with you. Let's make up.

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,560
It's my fault, okay?

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,600
Are all these beers? Why did you bring so many bee—

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,240
Beer? Beer sounds good!

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,810
This is nice.

45
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,450
Hey, I can't believe they even make beer cans which are this big.

46
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,530
Wow, this tastes awesome (thumbs up)!

47
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,970
Thumbs Up, you're forbidden to say "Thumbs up" today.

48
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,790
It makes me feel like I'm getting old.

49
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,680
Anyway, thanks to you we managed to drink beer after a long time.

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,350
Aish.

51
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,220
So you got all these snacks when you got fired from the convenience store,

52
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,250
and these beers when you got fired from the noraebang (karaoke)?

53
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,860
Hey! If you don't want them, give them back to me.

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,370
Hey, who said no? I didn't say I didn't want them.

55
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,710
Hey! Now that you mention it, I call this a party, but these are all actually my blood and sweat.

56
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,350
You all should know that while drinking and eating.

57
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,770
Aigoo. How did my life end up in this mess?

58
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,180
It's really sad. It's sad.

59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,840
Sad?

60
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,710
Then, let's drink to sadness today.

61
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,600
That's right. Let's just drink tonight.

62
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,920
Thumbs up!

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,440
Okay, then. Thumbs up!

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,600
Thumbs up!

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,550
To the right. To the right.

66
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,440
- To my right?
- To my right. To my right.

67
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,230
- Not to your right. Not to your right.
- Okay.

68
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,440
One, two, three!

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,300
Ta-da!

70
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,350
The atmosphere is nice!

71
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,070
You see? It's great, right?

72
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,210
Didn't you drink too much already?

73
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm fine now. I'm fine. I'm fine.

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,750
I don't know about anything else, but I acknowledge your fighting spirit.

75
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,820
What?

76
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,240
Woo Seung has already failed the exam three times, right?

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,420
Are you drunk? What are you talking about? Don't bring that up.

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,150
I really thought I'd make it this time.

79
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,930
I was confident too.

80
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,030
But, it's all because of that jerk!

81
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,790
You know there will be another exam. You'll make it next time.

82
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,770
No. I mean it's not like I'm getting greedy and want something big!

83
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,110
I want to live like others just an average life, that's my dream.

84
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,090
How come no one helps me with that?

85
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,000
That's not a dream.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What? What did you say?

87
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,850
That's right. How can making a living be a dream?

88
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,690
Dream isn't a word that is meant to be used for that.

89
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,310
While we are at it, why do you even wish to become an official civil servant? What are you risking your life for?

90
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,850
I think it sounds so boring and dull.

91
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,530
What do you know about my life?

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,010
You're homeless and you're living off a stranger, like a beggar.

93
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,910
Aigoo.This is all because you don't know who I am.

94
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,570
If you knew who I am, you'd be...

95
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,690
You must remember something since it's been a while already.

96
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,410
It's been a while I don't remember anything. Anyway, I'm just saying that.

97
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,180
Things will work out for us.

98
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,000
We may look like we are nothing right now,

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,350
but I'm sure things will work out.

100
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,840
Hey! What's up with the atmosphere? Don't be like this.

101
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,620
Should we play a game?

102
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,710
- A one, a two, a one, two, three, four!
- A one, a two...

103
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,270
Drama, drama. Name the drama's title!

104
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,380
"Descendants of the Sun!"

105
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,720
"Pinocchio."

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,940
"Signal!"

107
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,590
- "Tree Blooming with Love!"
- What?

108
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,710
- What tree?
- What blooming?

109
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,310
You don't know?

110
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,280
Another one then. "Under the Same Roof"!

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,200
- What roof?
- What family?

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,930
"Pilot"!

113
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,800
- I don't know.
- Man, what's that?

114
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
"Seoul Earthen Pot!"

115
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,430
- I don't know.
- I want to eat now.

116
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,500
"Jealousy!" "Jealousy!" You have to know "Jealousy."

117
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,320
What are you talking about?

118
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,610
- You don't know "Jealousy"?
- We don't.

119
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,260
♫ Who on earth are you looking at?

120
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,970
- You don't know?
- I don't know.
♫ I am standing here...

121
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,590
I said I don't know!

122
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,980
Right, during the last broadcast, there was a kiss scene and the camera was spinning around filming it.

123
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,550
- You don't know?
- We really don't know.

124
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,320
Okay. There's no way you wouldn't know this one!

125
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,270
"Justice Pao"!

126
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,030
- What?
- You don't know?!

127
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,890
"Bring out the straw cutter!" You don't know?

128
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,350
We really don't know.

129
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,560
Hey, hey, hey! You lost!

130
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,310
- You're right!
- Drink, drink, drink!

131
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,880
- You have to drink!
- The drink goes in!

132
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,030
- Wait a moment!
- Never mind about any of your troubles, forget them...

133
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,140
Hey, didn't you guys plan this?! How come you don't know the straw cutter?

134
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,310
Stop making excuses and drink immediately!

135
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,840
- Drink!
- Quickly, one shot!

136
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,000
Guys, make him chug it down!

137
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,770
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

138
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,900
Ah, I've been through a lot.

139
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,180
It's been a while since I last saw her play the piano.

140
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,140
I've never heard that song before. Whose song is it?

141
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,200
I think Woo Seung wrote it.

142
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,220
She was in a band until high school.

143
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,940
She was also so good at composing songs.

144
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,380
A band? That part-timer girl?

145
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm a little nervous.

146
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,390
What if she does her drunk act again?

147
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,190
What drunk act?

148
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,150
Hey. A drunk act with an introduction, development, turn, and conclusion.

149
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,750
So don't let her drink any more alcohol.

150
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,890
I think she's already completely drunk.

151
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,930
So how does she act drunk with an introduction, development, turn, and conclusion?

152
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,840
- What's the introduction?
-The introduction?

153
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,960
The introduction is when she starts acting cute.

154
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,960
Woo Seung is out of alcohol.

155
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,880
Give me more alcohol.

156
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,480
I think she's not cute, but crazy instead.

157
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,500
I'm not here.

158
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,000
Oppa, give me alcohol.

159
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,250
No. I don't think I can watch her anymore.

160
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,560
If you don't give me more alcohol,

161
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,520
then I'll take some selfies.

162
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,340
Click, selfie!

163
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,110
Click, selfie!

164
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,910
Ah. What's that sound?

165
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,360
- Don't you hear that sound?
- What sound?

166
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,110
The sound of Woo Seung's cuteness.

167
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,510
I can kill her.

168
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,580
What's the development?

169
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,710
The development is... When she gets angry without reason.

170
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,450
Are you honey-butter flavored?

171
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,650
I'm death flavored!

172
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,530
Ojingeo Squid Jjamppong

173
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,110
Look at you. Spicy squid flavor.

174
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,070
Do you know what spicy squid is like?!

175
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,230
Ah. Why is a squid out here?

176
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,360
Squid. Go back to your sea!

177
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,010
Go back! I said to go back! Nothing's going well after you came.

178
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,150
What's the turn?

179
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,960
The turn is Jeolla Province.

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,000
Ah. Let's have one more drink.

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,150
I asked you to have one more drink.

182
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,240
Just one more drink.

183
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
Is she from Jeolla Province?

184
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,870
- As far as I know, she's never been to Jeolla Province before.
- What?

185
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,440
Hey, you're making a fool of myself and I feel bad.

186
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,670
What are you looking at? Have you never seen an angry person before?!

187
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,280
I'll just pull out your tongue and make a red carpet out of it.

188
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,090
Guys, are you going to keep staring at me?

189
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,720
I should tighten your belts and turn you into hourglasses.

190
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,710
What's the conclusion?

191
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,930
The conclusion is... It comes down to this eventually.

192
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,330
Hey.

193
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,720
Now, we can finally drink in peace.

194
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,670
- Get me one beer.
- Okay.

195
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,930
What? What is it?

196
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,870
It's totally awesome, thumps up. Wow! How can it be possible if it doesn't have a power cord?

197
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,610
I hate it most when people touch my stuff without my permission.

198
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,500
You're really cheap.

199
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,280
Hello, everyone! I'm broadcasting drunk.

200
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,060
If you're drinking by yourself,

201
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,120
have a drink with me.

202
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,850
Cheers!

203
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,190

What is he doing?

205
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,230
Internet broadcasting. But nobody sees his internet broadcast.

World Entertainment

225
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,180
They should clean the dishes before leaving.

226
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,030
Anyway, I really don't want to see any of them. They're so annoying.

227
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,730
Bro, are you looking for something?

228
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,880
Have you seen my watch? I'm sure I put it here.

229
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,100
Your watch? No, I haven't.

230
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,730
Did you put it somewhere else?

231
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,180
No. I left it because it got broken, but it's not here.

232
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,900
Where did it go?

233
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,430
Jin Art Academy of Music
Convenience Store

234
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,410
How did it go?

235
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,310
The owner refused to tell me since it's considered personal information.

236
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,060
I barely persuaded him to tell me something by buying this ice cream.

237
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,960
That... Did you only buy one?

238
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,970
Pardon?

239
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,720
- Would you like a bite?
- Hey.

240
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,230
So what's the final result?

241
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,810
Nothing much. He said he only could give me her name and phone number.

242
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,650
Here.

243

Choi Woo Seung
010-4764-46

244
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,970
Choi Woo Seung?

245
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,040
- Hyung.
- What?

246
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,520
Pull the car over, there.

247
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,590
Hey, pull it over to the right side.

248
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,910
Hey!

249
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,980
Are you Choi Woo Seung (First Place)?

250
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,620
So what?

251
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,070
You said so what?

252
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,500
By any chance, is your younger brother, Jun Woo Seung (Second Place)?

253
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,140
What's he saying?

254
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,760
Never mind if he is not.

255
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,310
I was going to throw it away, but I'm giving it to you instead.

256
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,130
Hyung, let's go.

257
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,140
These are my summarized notes.

258
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,690
World Entertainment

259
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,770
Are you going to the event?

260
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,000
The kids are upstairs. Hey, you should have asked them to join you and help you somehow.

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,700
No. It didn't take me a lot of time though.

262
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,090
Aigoo. The kids should be helping you.

263
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,910
They knew you were carrying all the costumes.

264
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,820
Let them be.

265
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,970
Ah, I have a meeting in Dongdaemun for a while. I'll be back.

266
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,820
- Okay. Drive safely.
- Yes.

267
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,210
Ah, right. By any chance, have you seen the peanuts I bought?

268
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,010
I definitely bought a lot of them, but I couldn't find any of them.

269
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,490
I haven't seen them. Maybe, Ji Hoon ate them?

270
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,850
Ji Hoon can't eat peanuts because of his allergy.

271
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,270
Ah, right.

272
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,710
Then Chairman must have eaten them.

273
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,620
These days, he has been eating so many nuts that...

274
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,380
- Ah, peanuts?
- What?

275
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,420
No, it's nothing.

276
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,870
What is this?

277
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,350
These are some leftovers so you can eat them if you want.

278
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,100
Look at how you talk. Why would you tell me they're leftovers?

279
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,390
- If you don't want them, then I'll just take them back.
- No, no!

280
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,010
Anyway, I'll eat them well.

281
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,030
That's peanut jam.

282
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,210
What? What is it?

283
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,550
It's a food you can't eat. It's a peanut jam.

284
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,570
I said that?

285
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,230
That's how I remembered it. I'm sure of it.

286
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,850
- But, why are you so curious about that?
- What?

287
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,680
I have my reasons.

288
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,930
Yes, yes. Yes, I'm on my way now.

289
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,060
If it's Dongdaemun, I'll be there in no time.

290
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,350
Yes, bye.

291
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,590
Are you going to Dongdaemun?

292
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,930
When your boss carries around the costumes and gets ready for work, you guys should go and help him.

293
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,890
It's for your event.

294
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:48,150
Hey, I thought we were all in this together as a family, but I guess I was wrong.

295
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,470
Do you guys think it's okay as long as it's comfortable for you?

296
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,680
Hey, whoever saw you like this, they may think I'd be disciplining you severely.

297
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,050
- Just sit comfortably.
- Yes.

298
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,840
Immediately.

299
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,050
Make yourselves comfortable but don't cross your legs.

300
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,930
Yes, we understand.

301
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,270
What is this, the army?

302
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,860
Why are you stiff? Just make yourself comfortable. Just relax.

303
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,790
Yes, Unnie.

304
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,550
- Make yourself comfortable, but make your voice loud and clear.
- Yes, Unnie!

305
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,150
That's it. It's so nice to see you like this.

306
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,220
Let's do well, okay?

307
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,260
Hey!

308
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,900
Real Ji Hoon. What brings you here? You didn't go to the company today?

309
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,850
I'm on my way back. Today, you aren't going to work at the karaoke store, right?

310
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,390
Please help me.

311
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
- With what?
- It's my dad's birthday today.

312
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,620
I need to buy his birthday present.

313
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,930
But as you know, I don't have a good eye for choosing suitable things.

314
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,010
Why are you looking at me?

315
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,970
No, it's nothing. Let's go.

316
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,090
I'll be done with my work in an hour. So come to the parking lot after an hour. Okay?

317
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,780
Oh. I don't have a watch.

318
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,480
Isn't that a watch that you are now wearing?

319
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,610
Ah, this is broken.

320
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,600
Then you can ask around. I'll leave you if you're late.

321
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,380
♫  So the whole world can hear ♫

322
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,300
Wow! This is really awesome (thumbs up).

323
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,980
Wow!

324
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,140
♫ And I have something to say ♫

325
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,880
♫  Something to tell ♫

326
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,180
♫  I wanna love you  ♫

327
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,880
How about this? You don't like it?

328
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,290
You have a terrible taste.

329
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,230
Not at all.

330
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,650
What about this one?

331
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,380
You never think about buying a present for my birthday by yourself.

332
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,930
- Give me money. Money.
- I'm not thinking of giving you anything.

333
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,190
Okay. Don't give me anything. I'm confident that I'd laugh at the present you gave me.

334
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,960
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

335
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,850
Hey. How about we buy this instead?

336
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,510
Ahjussi wears a lot of casual clothes.

337
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,800
Pretty.

338
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,020
Impromptu Singing Contest
"I am a singer"

339
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,090
I am a singer...

340
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,410
1st Prize — Latest Mobile Phone

341
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,930
That's totally awesome (thumbs up)!

342
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,420
I think these shoes were the best choice.

343
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,060
That's weird of you.

344
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:11,140
That was a very passionate performance. Let's give him a big round of applause!

345
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,640
It was good. It was so nice.

346
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,220
Okay. We'll accept one last contestant. Is there anyone who wants to give it a go?

347
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,970
Anyone? Who wants to apply?

348
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,760
Here!

349
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,930
What are you doing?

350
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,520
Please come forward and ask for assistance to sign up.

351
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,720
- I won't do it.
- That's not a big deal.

352
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,190
You've been working on it for three years!

353
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,720
Hey, let me change my handphone. I want to get a new one.

354
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,380
And let them have a look at my trainee friend.

355
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,510
Ah, really. I can't.

356
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,980
You're buying samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly) then.

357
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,940
Of course, my friend!

358
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,520
Darn it.

359
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,890
Hey, Thumbs Up! Why are you here?

360
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,640
- Why are you here, guys?
- I had something to buy. What about you?

361
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,260
Ah! I bought some clothes too.

362
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,340
I only bought a few though, because I don't have enough money.

363
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,510
- You should have paid my money first!
- I'll pay you back.

364
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,050
Also, you shouldn't drink too much. How can a woman drink like that and behave so terrible?

365
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,000
But still, I don't cause any damage to others.

366
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,260
What no damage? That's what you think.

367
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,130
- Don't you have a drinking habit?
- A drinking habit?

368
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:21,610
Yes. When I'm really drunk, I give a kiss to just anyone near me.

369
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,210
But, that's a cute habit.

370
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,870
Aigoo.

371
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,190
Come here.

372
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,230
Hey, you.

373
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,810
- What?
- Then, it was you.

374
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,820
What's wrong with you?

375
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,400
You really!

376
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,110
No. Stop.

377
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,150
Hey, hey. Calm down.

378
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,330
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

379
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,330
You deserve a beating.

380
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,000
Be glad I'm done with only this much!

381
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,790
What was that?

382
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,200
I know I'm pretty.

383
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,580
What are you talking about?

384
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,120
Ah. By the way, part-timer.

385
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,100
Since you hit me, I'm going to use your name instead, for the contest.

386
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,140
I can't use Thumbs Up! after all.

387
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,970
- Hello
- Yes.

388
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,280
♫ My small hopes and dreams ♫

389
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,400
♫ I hope I won't lose them so I pray to the sky ♫

390
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,000
Hey! Please give her a round of applause.

391
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,730
Okay. Next, we'll meet the next contestant.

392
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,380
He is from Jeonnong-dong, Dongdaemun-gu.

393
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,350
Prince of Dongdaemun! Come up!

394
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,850
Please give him a round of applause.

395
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,560
Prince of Dongdaemun, fighting!
Please introduce yourself.

396
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,540
Hello. I'm Lee Ji Hoon from Jeonnong-dong.

397
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,680
By any chance, are you a student?

398
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,980
Yes, I'm a student.

399
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,870
Wherever their fans are, Helter-Skelter will go running hurriedly in all directions until they reach their fans.

400
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,100
That's the meaning behind their name.

401
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,860
Ah, is there an event being done over that stage?

402
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,640
Hey everyone, take a look at him. He's so good looking.

403
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,510
I think he could be a celebrity. He's so handsome.

404
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,770
What have you prepared for today?

405
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,820
I'll dance.

406
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,630
A dance?

407
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,810
Okay, great then. He's Jeonnong-dong Dance Machine. Prince of Dongdaemun will dance for us!

408
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,670
Please give him a round of applause. And please play the music!

409
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,220
Hey! Hey, a big round of applause.

410
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,240
Hey. Without looking at the next sequence, I think we all know who will get the handphone.

411
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,040
Don't you agree? Yes.

412
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,460
Thank you for your hard work. I would like you to give him a big round of applause again.

413
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,680
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon.
We'll greet our next contestant.

414
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,220
Hey, you're good.
Please come forward.

415
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,040
It's your fault. You made me...!
Everyone please give him a round of applause.

416
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,340
Yes, hello. Oh, his nickname is...

417
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,070
What to do with Thumbs Up? He wants a new handphone.
Rooftop Michael Jackson!

418
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,070
That I think he went up to get it no matter what.
Please introduce yourself.

419
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,170
Yes. I'm Choi Woo Seung. I'm 23 years old.

420
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,220
Are you 23 years old?

421
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,640
No. Your style of clothes makes you look like 43 years old.

422
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,900
He's just dragged my name through the mud.

423
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,020
You, white pants.

424
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,710
Yes. You have a strong character. That's fine.

425
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,130
Okay. He's the final contestant for today. The song he prepared is...

426
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,450
Yes, let me introduce it. It's titled "Tell me!"

427
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,340

431
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,150

455

Hey! Give him a big around of applause!

456
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,680
That was awesome. Yes, you can go down now.

457
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,240
- Wow! Everyone! Wasn't he great, right?!
- Yes!

458
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,050
Please give him another round of applause.

459
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,630
Hey, Thumbs Up! That was great!

460
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,410
What? Am I cool?

461
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,260
Not that much.

462
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,700
By the way, I think you really look a bit like Yoo Hyeon Jae.

463
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,760
Where does he look like him?

464
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,130
Okay. The judges told us that they have had a very hard time choosing the winner.

465
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,600
Now, the second place and the first place have only one point difference!

466
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,530
Today's first place is...

467
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:28,630
Congratulations Rooftop Michael Jackson! The winner is Choi Woo Seung!

468
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,170
Are you that happy?

469
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,300
Of course, I am.

470
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,040
Hey, hey. Look at this. The quality of the pictures is no joke.

471
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,210
Hey! This is also considered a memory. Let's take a picture.

472
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,560
- Hey, Lee Ji Hoon. Come here.
- I don't want a picture.

473
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,960
Hey, let's just take a picture. Come on quickly!

474
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,020
Immediately.

475
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,760
Look! Where there are three people in a photo, we can take it like this.

476
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,120
Hey! I told you not to touch my stuff, right?

477
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,110
What's yours? What are you talking about?

478
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,220
That's my watch.

479
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,590
What? How is this yours? It's mine.

480
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,840
Give it to me so that I can check it.

481
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,980
Oh my gosh.

482
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,330
Here.

483
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,750
Look at this. Is this your watch?

484
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,770
The initials are different.

485
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:54,040
That's right. The initials are not your name, Ji Hoon.

486
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,010
That's because... This watch is a keepsake from my late father.

487
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,780
What?

488
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,100
A keepsake from your late father?

489
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,930
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon!

490
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,910
What are you doing here?

491
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,940
Additional scenes

492
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,460
It's chilly.

493
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,590
I'll wear this.

494
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,640
Why is she sleeping here like this?

495
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,890
It's late, so let's clean up and go in.

496
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,240
What? Already?

497
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,550
- Hey, take it off!
- Why? Why?

498
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,360
You don't know that this is my favorite shirt.

499
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,040
- Take it off! Take it off!
- I won't wear it because it's dirty.

500
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,780
Hey!

501
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,920
- Hey, it smells bad.
- What? It must be your smell.

502
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,770
Hey, do you have any ramyeon left? I think it'd be nice to make some ramyeon.

503
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,910
You're so annoying anyway.

504
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,390
I'll go and buy it.

505
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,990
Hey!

506
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,300
- Wear it. It's quite chilly.
- It's really chilly.

507
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,360
I'll be back.

The Best Hit

521
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,740
What? Why?

522
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,840
My younger sister is really a fan of yours.

523
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,270
Anyway, that part-timer really does all sorts of odd jobs.

524
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,810
Mom, can you really call yourself a mom?

525
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,820
If you've called your daughter after a long time,

526
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,810
shouldn't you ask me if I've eaten at least?

527
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,830
I thought you might need this.

528
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,020
Is it just me?

529
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:10,200
Doesn't Thumbs Up look a little like Yoo Hyeon Jae?

530
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,260
How do I know this kid? This is my first time seeing him.

531
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,500
- This is also my first time seeing this kid.
- Kid?

532
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,170
You have no manners.

533
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,930
We don't look alike at all.

534
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,780
Let's say Ji Hoon is my son.

535
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,190
Then, who is his mom?

536
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,820
You really don't know?

537
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,200
By any chance...

538
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,200
♫ Fly, fly ♫

539
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,660
Is it Bo Hee?

540
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,080
♫ What makes you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful life  ♫

541
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,670
The Best Hit

542
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,930
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
