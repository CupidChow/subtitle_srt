00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,200
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,520
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,630
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,030
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,810
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,820
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,520
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,070
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,380
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,230
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,690
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,630
Chairwoman, if you change your mind all of a sudden, we really have no other way.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,730
We'll just go under.

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,540
Chairwoman, please think it over one more time.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,690
Here's the thing. I'm sorry to you, CEO Lee.

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,330
I'll just say that there's a better investment offer coming from somewhere else.

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,840
You already know. People like us don't know anything other than making money.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,090
Even if you invest in our company, you will never lose money.

20
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,810
I already looked into it a little bit.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,090
- But there's no one in your company right now.
- What?

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,610
You only have one trot group called "Helter-Skelter" who focuses on doing gigs.

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,580
Well... I'm forming another team together soon.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,040
You know me. I'm an old-fashioned person.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,750
I'm the type to knock on a strong stone bridge before crossing it.

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,330
But, CEO Lee's company doesn't even have a strong stone bridge to knock on.

27
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,420
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,790
No matter how much I like triangular Kimbap,

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,100
I didn't expect to come all this way here to eat it here too.

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,040
Because of whom are we like this now?

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,010
So, is this because of me? It's because of that drill.

32
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,120
- So why did you bring that drill?
- Ah, you seriously!

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Do something about that drill. The mere sight of it makes me sick.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,820
Ah, seriously. Who's cursing at me like this?

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,920
Ah, it tickles! Who is it?!

36
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,200
Is there anything you're curious about me?

37
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,280
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you the truth from the start.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,120
But, I couldn't say it.

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,490
I didn't know if people would believe me...

40
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,570
People are living so differently from what I thought.

41
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,270
I wonder if it's my fault.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,670
Then, when did you come here?

43
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,190
In 1993.

44
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,440
If it was 1993, then you and my mom...

45
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,870
I only knew her name.

46
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,760
Somehow, I found out that she was Gwang Jae's friend from his hometown.

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,850
We met a few times together.

48
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,690
Then, I don't know about anything yet.

49
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,850
I've always wondered about these things.

50
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,930
Why did that person abandon us?

51
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,900
Why couldn't he tell us where he was going?

52
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,160
Why couldn't he tell us where he was or when he got there?

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,220
Does he know me?

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,240
Does he know that...

55
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,540
I'm living a great life doing well?

56
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,660
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,100
It feels like I'm blaming you for the days you haven't even lived yet.

58
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,830
I know it's not fair to blame you.

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,510
But, whenever I see you...

60
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,930
I've been there. I didn't go through it but it's still me.

61
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,020
I used to be a little selfish. I lived alone because I was so proud of myself.

62
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,930
I never had a family when I was younger.

63
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,220
And as I grew up, I became a popular star.

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,480
So that's why I never managed to live a normal life like other people.

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,350
I didn't know what a normal life was.

66
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:27,190
For the first time, sinceI came here, I don't feel lonely living here with you guys.

67
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,840
I don't know what you guys think, but

68
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,090
everyone was like a family to me.

69
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,990
I always thought I did everything by myself.

70
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,900
I thought everyone was staying by my side to use me.

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,550
If you think about it, this time is strange.

72
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,110
This time I spend talking to you like this.

73
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,870
You're right.

74
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,060
But...

75
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,400
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,780
I couldn't be by your side.

77
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm sorry for making you feel lonely.

78
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm sorry for the things I did to say sorry.

79
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,600
♫ Yes, fool, I have a lot to say to you too ♫

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,950
♫  All day, I wrote down funny things that happened ♫

81
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,370
♫  I’ll tell you all of it as I slowly fall asleep ♫

82
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,070
♫  I’ll tell you stories cozy like the clouds ♫

83
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,850
♫  At night, it’s too dark but ♫

84
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,450
♫  I’ll be your roof, don’t worry ♫

85
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,490
♫  You don’t have to say anything, I have no choice but to love you ♫

86
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,770
♫  You wrap your arms around my neck, I have no choice but to hug you ♫

87
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,610
♫ I look at you but I miss you ♫

88
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,630
♫  When I tell myself that, I really do miss you ♫

89
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,760
♫  I don’t wanna miss a single moment ♫

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,340
♫ I can’t fall asleep until you fall asleep ♫

91
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,330
♫  Moments I don’t wanna forget ♫

92
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,520
♫  I blink and capture the moment in my heart ♫

93
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,250
♫ Good night ♫

94
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,220
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

95
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,290
♫  Only to you, I can give my all ♫

96
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,720
♫ Remember my love, my eyes, my story ♫

97
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,220
I thought I finally saw you smile again.

98
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,120
♫  And what I wanna say is ♫

99
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,380
Part-timer, where are you?

100
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,840
You must be at home?

101
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,990
I'm studying.

102
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,330
Then I shouldn't bother you.

103
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't live too diligently, or don't live only for the future.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,990
Don't look at what's above you too much.

105
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,240
All the fun in the world is already by your side.

106
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,290
Don't be a fool who knows nothing like me.

107
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,960
I won't bother you anymore.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,300
♫ I like it when you look at me from by my side ♫

109
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,070
♫ I like it when you lean on my shoulder ♫

110
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,550
♫ Remember my love, my eyes  ♫

111
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,790
Don't live too diligently, or don't live only for the future.

112
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,400
Don't look at what's above you too much. All the fun in the world is already by your side.

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,000
♫  My hope, it’s all you ♫

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,710
♫  And what I wanna say is ♫

115
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,490
♫  I only love you ♫

116
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,930
Didn't you go out? I put the camping equipment in the storage.

117
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,210
What? Okay.

118
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,280
Why do you look so serious?

119
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,770
Hey, is the company ruined?

120
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,930
Okay. It's about to be ruined before it even started.

121
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,910
What? You said you got investments?

122
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,590
I think someone got in the middle. Someone with much better conditions than ours.

123
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,430
- Who did that?
- I'm trying to find out.

124
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,760
Honestly, that's not what's important now.

125
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,190
Hey, we're going to have to stop everything we've been working on right now.

126
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,290
- You're saying you can't get even a single investment?
- That's right.

127
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,410
Well, I'll just have to try asking other places.

128
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,320
Right. Did you talk to Ji Hoon?

129
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,200
What? Well, yes.

130
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,340
How did it go?

131
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,610
You know him. He's a nice kid.

132
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,620
Ji Hoon is nice and kind.

133
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,930
Hey, I'm busy. Let's talk later.

134
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,070
Okay. I got it.

135
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,310
Hello?

136
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,540
Master, this is MJ.

137
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,470
Where are you?

138
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,330
♫ When I still see you ♫

139
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,330
How is it?
♫  When I see you asleep ♫

140
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,160
♫  I remember when we first met ♫

141
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,200
♫  You’re still so beautiful ♫

142
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,740
Good. Master, you're really amazing.

143
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,060
I don't think you're as bad as I thought you were.

144
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,910
You have good ears, and you have good eyes to see someone who is great.

145
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,030
But, how did you get involved with Yeong Jae?

146
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,060
I was foolish back then.

147
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,260
So you know now.

148
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,850
At first, I thought all I had to do was debut.

149
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,620
But as expected, I'm getting more and more greedy.

150
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,800
But every time I got what I wanted according to my greed,

151
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,250
I was strangely not happy somehow,

152
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,590
- because everything was a lie.
- Of course.

153
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,220
At first, I thought it wasn't important,

154
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,110
but things just got out of hand.

155
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,820
As you already know, I'm too great.

156
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Come to think of it, you remind me of myself.

157
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,410
- What?
- Not really.

158
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,540
Forget it.

159
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,430
- When does your contract end here?
- Why?

160
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,450
There is a man called Gwang Jae. He's Yeong Jae's enemy.

161
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,490
What should you do? Would you like to meet him?

162
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,030
Yeong Jae, Gwang Jae...

163
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,850
Two Jae? Hey, It's a little hard.

164
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,370
You should listen to what an adult says.

165
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,180
- Double Jae!
- Double Jae?

166
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,020
Master.

167
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,740
World Entertainment

168
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,140
I've got everything organized here.

169
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,330
I don't know how you can feel the emptiness of a seat once someone is gone.

170
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,210
Is there anything I can pack from here?

171
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,710
What is this?

172
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,200
What?

173
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,560
That's a coda mark.

174
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,780
If it is to coda,

175
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,770
then that means you have transferred it to a coda section.

176
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,320
Segi Bank

177
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,990
It's correct. That's the key used for keeping lock boxes in our bank in the past.

178
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,900
So, this key is...

179
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,430
You've been using our personal private safe of our bank since 1994. You paid the fee in one lump sum.

180
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,960
We have already confirmed the key so you only need to enter your passcode here.

181
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,020
- My passcode?
- You set up your password before.

182
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,160
Ah, my passcode.

183
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
If I were Yoo Hyeon Jae from 1994,

184
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,710
What numbers would he put as his passcode?

185
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,890
At that time, the most important thing for Yoo Hyeon Jae was...

186
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,250
22198... It meant "I want to be with you alone".

187
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,770
- It was like a code for me.
- A code?

188
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,680
22198 was a code that he and I used when we wanted to meet each other.

189
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,360
Right.

190
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,730
Wait a moment.

191
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,490
It's correct. You can follow me with the key.

192
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,610
- Please take your time checking.
- Yes.

193
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,420
2 million dollars

194
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,800
Did I change it into a check?

195
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,060
Wow! As expected, I'm great!

196
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,990
I think it was torn from my notebook.

197
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,930
Did I write this in 1994?

198
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,240
Was it all because of this?

199
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,350
What's so important about this?

200
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,530
Well, I think these terms are good enough for the contract.

201
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,020
I've also reviewed it.

202
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,100
How about if we make it a little more favorable for MJ?

203
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,400
What are you talking about?

204
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,970
He contributed a lot to the company.

205
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,610
These days, he's free because it's before the album comes out...

206
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,670
As you know, we don't have time to sleep when we start promoting.

207
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,780
These days, it's a trend that companies give a lot more dividends to their artists.

208
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,900
Why are you acting like you know nothing about this business?

209
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,340
Thanks to whom is he now successful?

210
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,890
You're right about that, but...

211
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,050
You're so soft-hearted. How are you going to do your job later?

212
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,430
This is enough. You may go now.

213
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,580
Take extra care and attention with MJ. Even sending him texts should be done carefully.

214
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,750
Yes, I understand.

215
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,150
What's the matter?

216
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,740
- I have great news.
- Great news?

217
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,290
You wanted to find our settlement money, right?

218
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,500
What do you mean? When did I?

219
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,190
Because of that, you wanted to buy their building so badly. You were drooling over it.

220
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,770
I don't know what you're talking about. If you're going to say weird things, get out.

221
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,770
This.

222
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,730
You found it.

223
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,360
Where on earth did you...? It was in the rooftop room, right?

224
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,070
So, did you know this from the beginning and go to live there on purpose?

225
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,340
You shameless fellow.

226
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,570
Don't mind the details. I'm giving you this but instead let me ask you for a favor.

227
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,560
You will give this to me?

228
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,060
Instead, cancel the contract with MJ that expires in a month.

229
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,670
- What?
- You can't even control him anyway.

230
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,860
Wait. Why are you doing this for MJ?

231
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,610
- Then what about the renewal of his contract?
- I don't know about that.

232
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,340
You can either dump him or you can convince him over.

233
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,310
Okay then.

234
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,640
Contracts

235
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,210
Here.

236
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,590
Then, the contract between Star Punch Entertainment and MJ is over.

237
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay. Then from now on, we don't need to care for MJ, right?

238
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,180
Be prepared, you'll get bad articles criticizing him right away. We've already been blocking a lot of them lately.

239
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,660
That's what you do.

240
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,430
Hey, punk! Are you crazy?

241
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,100
No way, are you saying that you gave away all the money to Yeong Jae?

242
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,830
Hey, you idiot. Does this even make sense?

243
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,600
Calm down.

244
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,710
Calm down, my foot.

245
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,500
Hey, how can you be so consistent in causing trouble from beginning to end?

246
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,130
No way. I should go and meet Yeong Jae immediately.

247
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,410
Don't meet with Yeong Jae. Why don't you meet Chairwoman Oh instead?

248
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,810
I told you that investment fell over.

249
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,260
And Chairwoman Oh is not the type of person to change her mind.

250
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,290
She said that the risk of investment is high because the size of World Entertainment is small?

251
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:59,450
So what if we have a great and well-known famous artist on our side at World Entertainment?

252
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,800
Then, she'll change her mind.

253
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,630
Ah, you're really acting like Helter-Skelter by shouting, jumping around, and then you're sitting there talking nonsense.

254
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,150
Hey, a youngster who is already popular and trendy.

255
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,070
Do you think he's crazy enough to sign a contract with our World Entertainment company?

256
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,970
Also, the only thing we can give him as a down payment right now is debt. Do you know that?

257
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,250
Anyway, you're again at it exaggerating things.

258
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,730
Get a contract ready.

259
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,110
What contract?

260
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,020
Didn't you hear that there is no down payment I can give him?

261
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,110
For the time being, no down payment is required.

262
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,970
Two million dollars.

263
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,560
It's right. 2 million dollars.

264
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,390
Juhan Bank

265
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,580
What?

266
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,570
Juhan Bank? If it's Juhan Bank...

267
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,360
Isn't it the bank that went bankrupt and disappeared during IMF incident...

268
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,980
Come in for a moment.

269
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,100
Yes, CEO.

270
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,260
Can you change this Juhan Bank's check into cash?

271
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,200
From Juhan Bank? That bank went bankrupt and it's gone.

272
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,280
So? You can or you can't?

273
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,690
I don't think I can. It went bankrupt a long time ago.

274
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,640
- Go and check it immediately.
- Yes.

275
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,060
Yoo Hyeon Jae, that punk seriously!

276
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,430
CEO Lee, I'm sorry for making you wait.

277
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,540
I have a meeting to attend outdoors so I have to go out soon.

278
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,390
If it's not urgent, let's talk later.

279
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,390
Last time, you said that our company is too weak and too small for you to invest in, right?

280
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,700
Well, if you put it in that way, then you're right.

281
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,610
This time, we have a new artist we have recruited.

282
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,700
Is that so? Who is it?

283
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,580
He's on his way to come here now.

284
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,950
Hi, Chairwoman Oh.

285
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,500
Did you sign a contract with MJ?

286
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,330
Aigoo. The car is too small, right?

287
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,720
I'll change it into a bigger one, so just bear with it a little more.

288
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,410
Yes.

289
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,820
Ah, you're hurting my feelings. You used to be so mean to me before.

290
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,150
You don't even remember I used to carry you on my back so many times, do you?

291
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,910
- Keep your promise.
- What promise?

292
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,780
That you'll teach me how to compose songs.

293
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,350
How can I teach you something like that? You're born with it.

294
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,250
What? Did you lie to me?

295
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,190
Hey! Thanks to my songs, you've been doing well and have become this successful.

296
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,190
But, thanks to you, my songs are still alive.

297
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,680
Try composing songs yourself.

298
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,340
Try it and if you can't do it, then there is nothing else you can do.

299
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,360
If you do well, you'll just keep doing better.

300
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,790
The way I see it, I don't think you can do anything.

301
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,820
Mgoon, don't worry about it.

302
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,820
Even if I have to strangle this punk, I'm going to get you some songs from him.

303
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,030
Master.

304
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,970
Right. Mgoon.

305
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,940
Big Master.

306
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,950
Hey, Part-timer.

307
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,270
You can't slack off just because you're part-timers.

308
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,690
- Make sure you organize all these by today.
- Yes.

309
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,220
By the way, Woo Seung our printer needs maintenance service.

310
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,290
The toner is completely gone.

311
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,490
- Please call the service center.
- Yes.

312
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,730
Hey.

313
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,270
Yoo Hyeon Jae.

314
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,770
President. Do you recognize me?

315
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,780
Of course. I do.

316
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,890
Do you think I've forgotten your face just because I haven't seen you in a long while, you punk?

317
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,580
What?

318
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:42,500
So, did you think you'd be able to do whatever you want once you ran away with the settlement money?

319
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:51,420
Somehow or other, I'm going to ban you from appearing on the three major broadcasting stations, you punk!

320
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,250
A contract, my foot. Since when did we sign contracts and work like that, you punk?

321
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,340
President, I'm sorry.

322
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,320
What's with you punk all of a sudden?

323
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,810
I found out too late that I shouldn't do things that way.

324
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:20,120
And just like you said about J2, I wasn't the only one who did it.

325
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,820
You... What kind of medicine are you taking?

326
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,520
But still, it's nice to be able to tell you directly that I'm sorry.

327
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,130
Don't hate me too much.

328
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,260
I didn't know it was my fault that I did wrong back then.

329
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,690
Did you really realize what you did was wrong?

330
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,680
Yes.

331
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,960
Then, make J2's second album with us.

332
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,970
Then it'll be all right between us.

333
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,690
Ah, right. And about the letter, you sent me last time.

334
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,630
What was it about?

335
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,110
I got so pissed off, so I just put it somewhere else. Was it important?

336
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,110
- A letter?
- That's right, a letter. You punk!

337
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:09,670
Ah. Hey, but why am I getting a headache all of a sudden? Aigoo.

338
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,410
Are you okay?

339
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,590
Ah, yes. I'm fine. I'm fine.

340
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,470
Wait. What's this place?

341
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,620
This is the office.

342
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,460
Ah, right. We're in the office.

343
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:37,890
Hey, you punk. This is all because you look so similar to Yoo Hyeon Jae.

344
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,110
So that's why I'm experiencing nightmares like this one, you punk!

345
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,280
Hey, punk. How can you look exactly like him?

346
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,660
Oh, my goodness. My head hurts.

347
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,200
Ah, what's wrong with me?

348
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,280
- Yeah, it's me.
- Hey, Yoo Hyeon Jae.

349
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,980
This is a scam. Scam!

350
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,130
I never mentioned the bank's name. I only said I found the settlement money.

351
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,730
I'm not going to leave you alone.

352
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,850
Whether or not to leave me alone is your choice.

353
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,190
Just think of it as you paid off what you owe in the meantime.

354
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,770
You seem to think that I'm still the Park Yeong Jae that followed you around,

355
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,960
but you are wrong.

356
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,340
This jerk, to the end he does this.

357
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,540
What's this?

358
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,940
- Well, I thought you would need to listen to this in person.
- What is it?

359
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,320
I think the general manager knew everything in advance that we will do it this way.

360
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,890
No way. What would he know?

361
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,240
Listen to this.

367

Ah, this jerk.

368
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,040
But still, we were on the same team. Did I go too far with Yeong Jae?

369
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,130
No, that's not it.

370
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,160
Welcome.

371
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,860
Is there anything you're looking for?

372
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,780
Ah, I'm here to look at watches. The ones the young people like.

373
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,190
The young people nowadays?

374
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,520
I'm going to give it to my friend.

375
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,350
I understand.

376
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,120
Ah, nowadays watches like this sell well.

377
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,350
This is a smartwatch.

378
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,490
- Would you like to try it personally?
- Sure.

379
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:25,370
The buckles and straps are replaceable, so young people tend to like it.

380
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,230
You can have a look.

381
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,270
- Excuse me.
- But we're about to close.

382
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,520
No, yesterday, I think I left my wallet here.

383
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,960
Is it okay if I check the CCTV footage?

384
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,790
The CCTV footage? Yeah, go ahead.

385
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,310
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

386
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,360
- At dinner time?
- Yes.

387
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,240
This is you, right?

388
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,850
I'll put it in a slow mode like this.

389
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,370
Right there! You left the store with your wallet.

390
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,360
I think you might've lost your wallet somewhere else.

391
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,520
Oh, where did I leave it?

392
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:27,190
- Work hard.
- Yes, goodbye!

393
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,700
What's this? It's Gwang Jae?

394
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,090
What's he doing?

395
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,180
Da Bong. Thank you.

396
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,560
I'll close up the shop, so you can go home.

397
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,810
But... I think you have to see this.

398
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,630
Huh? What?

399
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,040
You're not going to go home?

400
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,500
I'll have to go soon.

401
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,020
I'm thankful for today's work.

402
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,960
As if you're thankful.

403
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,250
Oh, right.

404
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,360
I think President Soondae should go to the hospital to see a doctor.

405
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,580
Why should President do that? Who on earth is as healthy as he is at his age?

406
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,180
I'm not sure of the exact circumstances, but that is it. He must go.

407
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,940
Okay, I got it.

408
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:27,330
Hwang Jae, can't you live for yourself for one day?

409
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,570
What are you talking about?

410
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,300
Don't put anything off till the next time.

411
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,970
What a blockhead.

412
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,280
Just think about yourself. And also, do what you want.

413
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,930
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

414
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:01,610
Wasn't it hard to close it alone, right?

415
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:05,930
Starting tomorrow, I'll never be late again. Let's go up.

416
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,670
I told you not to handle heavy things!

417
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,690
I can do it by myself.

418
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,720
Wait a moment.

419
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,350
Let's stay like this for a bit.

420
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,540
I'm at the rooftop. Can you meet me here for a bit?

421
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,480
At first I thought it was easy, but no matter how much I think about it,

422
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,480
it doesn't seem like this is the place where I belong.

423
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,260
I seemed to be like a wrong thing that's put in the wrong place.

424
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:52,250
But I still want to see your face one last time,

425
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,060
so I'll wait until 10 pm.
