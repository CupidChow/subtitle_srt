00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,420
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,410
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,610
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,050
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,680
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,870
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,820
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,190
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,350
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,200
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,180
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,990
- I'm Team leader Lee Hyeong Mo.
- Ah, yes.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,820
Ah, it is an honor to meet you like this.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,010
Thank you for calling me here.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,020
I'm not really lying when I say this.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,770
We only take your digestive medicine here.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,630
I guess this is what people call fate.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,560
Then, shall we get down to business?

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,640
Yes.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,780
This is the storyboard for the commercial.

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,790
The main female character is eating gimbap deliciously.

23
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,810
As you can see here, a piece of gimbap, she was eating, is stuck right here.

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,040
The Kimbab between them is also agonizing.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,020
That's funny.

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,690
At this time, the female character takes digestive medicine...

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,190
Then the gimbap will get digested and sucked into the stomach.

28
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,440
Ah.

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,200
Bo Hee's favorite food is gimbap.

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,750
Don't worry because she'll eat it really deliciously.

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,900
But... Bo Hee is the gimbap here.

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,770
What?

33
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,690
The gimbap?

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,740
Yes, the gimbap.

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,340
This person seriously. Are you kidding me?

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,550
How on earth can you ask the Pure Fairy to play the gimbap role?

37
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,020
What? Gimbap role?

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,590
The gimbap is really popping out and it'll hit you to stop talking such nonsense!

39
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,040
Let's go Bo Hee.

40
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,830
No. What's wrong with a gimbap?

41
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,160
Good job. You did well.

42
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,990
How could you do that, punk? What are you supposed to do when you come out against it in that way.

43
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,450
You know, this industry may seem like it's wide, but it's actually very narrow.

44
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,060
You don't even know when and how you might run into them again in the future.

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,850
Aigoo, I can guarantee you that

46
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,970
you're going to be ruined by your hot temper.

47
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,500
You see, it is not that money comes before people. Is money more important than people?

48
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,100
I don't want my family to get hurt because of money. I'll hate it.

49
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,660
Are you going to protect your family with just nothing?

50
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,290
This building looks like it's going to be taken right away. Do you have any money left?

51
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,840
I'm looking for money somehow.

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,500
Listen to me this time.

53
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,230
I abandoned my pride,

54
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,650
and I contacted Yeong Jae.

55
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,350
Why did you that?

56
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,970
Shouldn't we save the building?

57
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,220
Hey, let's go. Let's go to see him and flatter him a little bit.

58
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,210
Right. Just think of Yeong Jae as a dog.

59
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,220
No matter what he does, you'll think, "Ah, he's cute."

60
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,640
Even if he says something annoying that you don't like,

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,590
you'll think he's just barking and you won't take his words seriously, you punk!

62
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,680
Do you understand? Let's go. Hurry up.

63
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,170
Yes, CEO. I understand.

64
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,020
CEO seems to be in a long meeting. He wants to see you another day.

65
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,680
Oh, he called me even though I'm sick and filmed all night. What's he thinking?

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,710
Hyung, how long do I have left until my contract expires with Star Punch Entertainment?

67
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,180
Hey, there's nothing I can really say.

68
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,440
Right. The youngest daughter of Taewoon Industries is interviewing us today.

69
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,120
Ah, I said I wouldn't participate in that interview.

70
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,400
Even if the medicine is bitter, medicine that's bitter is usually good for your body. Isn't it?

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,270
The same goes for people. Even if there is someone you don't want to meet, they can be more helpful in your life later.

72
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,130
But still, how could they hire an amateur for the show?

73
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,230
Who told you to go on stage? Just let her interview you and see what she has to show us.

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,380
At first glance, it seems like she's a fan of yours.

75
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,460
She's going to use this excuse to talk to you for a while.

76
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,640
Whatever! I'm already tired.

77
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,470
She must be here.

78
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,520
Hello.

79
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,370
- What brings you here?
- I'm here for an intern interview.

80
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,220
An intern interview? Wait a moment.

81
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,680
Did you come for an interview?

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,930
Pardon?

83
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,740
Yes.

84
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,890
Please follow me.

85
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,880
Please come in.

86
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,010
Is the interview being held here?

87
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,240
That's right. Since it's only you.

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,720
It's only me?

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,210
Are you that happy?

90
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,010
Ah, yes.

91
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,710
Where did this annoying punk go again?

92
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,430
- Please sit here and wait a moment.
- Yes.

93
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,720
This office is really spacious!

94
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,940
What? You're here.

95
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,270
Pardon? Yes!

96
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,690
It's MJ.

97
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,810
Where is my hyung?

98
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,930
- Didn't you come here with him?
- What?

99
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,040
Didn't you come for an interview?

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,670
Yes.

101
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,740
Then do it.

102
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,350
What?

103
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,080
What should I see first?

104
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,170
Let's start with the song. Let me see you sing first.

105
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,980
What?

106
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,740
What is this? Why is he asking me to sing?

107
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,360
Maybve because it's an entertainment company?

108
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,450
I'm a busy person you know.

109
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,470
Yes. Whatever you say I really have to do it...

110
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,690
♫ We listen to all of you guys ♫

111
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,670
♫  I'll make sure you change your path  ♫

112
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,920
♫ Wait, ha ha. ♫

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,870
It's amazing how we're really back...

114
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,310
Stop. Just stop. That's enough.

115
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,270
- You can't sing.
- What?

116
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,220
- Don't you think so?
- Well...

117
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,370
Let me see you dance this time.

118
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,590
What?

119
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,230
Your singing was disappointing.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,750
I hope you can dance well.

121
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,520
Yes, well...

122
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,640
What's this? Why does he suddenly want me to dance?

123
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,880
No. I think I've heard that they have these kinds of interviews lately.

124
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,180
You're taking too much time.

125
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,140
Yes. Then I'll dance.

126
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,340
What is this?

127
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,060
You...

128
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,250
You!

129
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,450
Are you Second Place?

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,390
Second Place? You are Second Place.

131
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm busy. Why did you want to see me?

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,510
We came to ask you a favor.

133
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,730
The Great Lee Gwang Jae is actually asking me for a favor.

134
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,880
What is it?

135
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,550
You know I'm not a good talker, right?

136
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,350
I'll just go straight to the point.

137
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,900
I'd appreciate it if you did.

138
00:07:52,940 --> 00:08:00,230
It's about our building. We took out a loan from the bank and it's now overdue.

139
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,220
If we can't pay it back by the end of the month, it'll be foreclosed and put up for auction.

140
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,540
How much do you need?

141
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,830
First, if you lend me 20,000 dollars, I think I'll be able to settle what's urgent.

142
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,710
We've known each other for a long time.

143
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,420
You know that when I was in J2,

144
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,000
I really suffered and went through a lot.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,730
- You know, right?
- What?

146
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,200
Yes. I know.

147
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,190
You and Chairman were always busy taking care only of Hyeon Jae.

148
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:43,060
Hey. That's because you are capable of doing things by yourself.

149
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,000
I always asked you to include my song in our albums but you never did it, not even once.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,390
Our business went down for a reason. We didn't have ears for music back then.

151
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,620
Gwang Jae, why are you not saying anything?

152
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,630
You know I don't have a good eye for noticing people's potential.

153
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,720
I never really said anything. But I'm envious of you whenever I see you.

154
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Well, You have to be born with talent. Right?

155
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,670
Gwang Jae, it's not something someone like you can do just by trying. It won't make any difference.

156
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,350
CEO, you're here. I have several things to report to you.

157
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,670
No. It's not like they're important people. You can report them to me now.

158
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,830
What's the matter?

159
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,870
This is the list of dropouts who didn't make it for the pre-debut team.

160
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,740
Please review it and make a decision on who should be expelled.

161
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,970
- What? Should I care about these kids?
- I apologize.

162
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,920
Just solve these kinds of matters by yourself.

163
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,300
You can go.

164
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,530
Why should I? Whenever I think about J2,

165
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,560
strangely, I feel so bad.

166
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,540
That's understandable.

167
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,630
You know Hyeon Jae was always trying to take the lead. Right?

168
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,310
The result is what matters in everything, right?

169
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,480
In the end, look at how things turned out. You're up and Hyeon Jae is down.

170
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,050
Well, that's right.

171
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,350
Leave your account number first.

172
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,540
Ah, that's right. Thank you. Call us when you send the money.

173
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,310
Hey! You did well, you punk.

174
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,810
Good job. Good job.

175
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,050
Aigoo.

178
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
Hey, hey! What's wrong, you punk?

179
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,240
Gwang Jae!

180
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,980
You have a good eye at noticing people's potential?

181
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,580
- Hey! Where is your good eye at noticing people's potential?
- What?

182
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,770
Hey, hey. Gwang Jae, why are you being like this?

183
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,880
You punk, you don't know what's going to happen to those people.

184
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,600
How come the CEO of a talent company is a loser like you who is always steaming and sitting back in your office?

185
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,490
No one even knows how high up these dropouts, whom you threw in the trash, can reach in the future.

186
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,740
I feel sorry for the poor kids who trusted you at first and gave their all for this company just for nothing.

187
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,980
I'm an idiot for coming to borrow money from a guy like you.

188
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,150
Your money? Even if you lend it to me, I won't accept it for sure! You bastard!

189
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,840
Hey. Sorry.

190
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,260
Hey! Are you crazy?

191
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,480
Hey, punk. How could you scatter ashes on already cooked rice?!

192
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,420
Nice job. Why did you do that all of a sudden?

193
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,460
Bo Hee is listening so let's talk about it later.

194
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,380
She needs to know what's going on.

195
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,540
The building is in such a difficult situation it's going to be snatched away.

196
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,240
Will your pride help us to protect it?

197
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,740
At this age, to accept that you and I go together to bow down our heads in front of that punk...

198
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,940
Do you think that's easy for me to do?

199
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,990
- Let's go outside.
- Why?

200
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,600
Let's go outside to talk.

202
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,660
I mistook you for someone else. I'm sorry.

203
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,220
No. It's okay. I'll get going first.

204
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,680
Is she supposed to get hired by our company?

205
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,930
Excuse me. I'm a bit late but...

206
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,850
- What's your name?
- Choi Woo Seung.

207
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,780
Choi Woo Seung.

208
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm sorry but you were already marked as absent.

209
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,240
Ah. Is there any way you can help me out once?

210
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,130
The last group just went it.

211
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,690
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,220
I'm hello. I'm Choi Woo Seung.

213
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,760
Who is she?

214
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,970
There was an internship interview, but this applicant is late.

215
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,470
I'm a bit late.

216
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,210
If you give me one more chance, I'll do my best.

217
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,440
This opportunity is not easily given to anyone. You have to catch it when you can.

218
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,800
If you can't come to an interview on time, I'm not sure how I can give you another opportunity even if you beg me.

219
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,390
- Let's get going.
- Yes.

220
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,860
CEO!

221
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,860
About the guy, you asked me to contact.

222
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,740
I think MJ played a prank on us.

223
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,390
I looked into it, and it turned out to be that it was a girl, not a boy.

224
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,420
I heard he looks like Hyeon Jae.

225
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,770
What? But, I found out that the girl was doing a part-time job there.

226
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,250
Really?

227
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,910
- Give her a call then.
- What?

228
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,120
Okay.

229
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,360
Restricted number

230
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,040
Who is it?

231
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,190
But, what if she knows this call is from us and we get caught?

232
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,330
Hey. It's a restricted number, so she'll never find out.

233
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,600
Really?

234
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,080
Hello?

235
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,640
She accepted the call.

236
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,970
Hello?

237
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,860
Who is it?

238
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,460
Leave it to me. Give it to me.

239
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,190
Hello.

240
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,260
Yes, hello?

241
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,460
Choi Woo Seung, I'm sorry to ask this.

242
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,650
By any chance do you know MJ?

243
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,780
What I mean to ask... Not just his name, do you know him personally?

244
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,130
What? Personally?

245
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,780
Yes. I know him a little.

246
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,010
How do you know MJ and for how long have you known him?

247
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,390
Well, I...

248
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,060
By any chance are you CEO Park Yeong Jae?

249
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,960
Pardon?

250
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,300
No, I'm not Park Yeong Jae.

251
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:44,860
Excuse me.

252
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,060
You startled me. What is it?

253
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,050
You just called me, right?

254
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,500
Then you are...

255
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,510
Yes, that's right.

256
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,000
That's how this thing notifies me.

257
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,150
This is pretty great.

258
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,710
Right. The e-mail.

259
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,550
Ddabong! (Thumbs Up!)
A new mail has arrived.

260
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,470
Welcome. You're now an official member of the Lost & Found Cafe
"Questions on Yoo Hyeon Jae's disappearance"

261
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,520
Oh, finally.

262
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,110
"Questions on Yoo Hyeon Jae's disappearance"

263
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,340
The day I remember Yoo Hyeon Jae.

264
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,890
Oppa, it's an unusual night.

265
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,760
I heard Oppa Hyeon Jae's current song on the radio today.

266
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,700
If Oppa were still alive, he would be getting old with us, right?

267
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,600
What kind of music would he be making?

268
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,940
When I heard Oppa's music for the first time, I was in middle school.

269
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,370
Now my eldest kid is in middle school.

270
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,220
You guys haven't forgotten about me yet.

271
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,970
Ah, I guess I'm really dead.

272
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,180
All questions on Yoo Hyeon Jae's disappearance.

273
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,650
What is it? Why are there so many posts?

274
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,660
Full members only:
The suspect.

275
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,430
What? There was a suspect?

276
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,030
Warning!

277
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,180
That's right. I'm glad I became a full member.

278
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,040
This is confidential. Do not leak out this information.
Agree

279
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,890
The suspect.

280
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,440
Park Yeong Jae.

281
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,020
That's right. That guy can even do that.

282
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,220
What? That's Gwang Jae.

283
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,850
Gwang Jae?

284
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,310
Did you call me to kick me out again? I already told you I can't leave.

285
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,630
Earlier, you came down to the store in the daytime?

286
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,510
- Bo Hee offered me bread first.
- It took her 20 years to get over you.

287
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,700
I have no feelings for her.

288
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,730
She and I didn't have anything going on in the first place.

289
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,400
It's just you can't remember it.

290
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,060
It's not the same for Bo Hee. So please move out of the rooftop room.

291
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,490
What? Hey, what will I do if I get kicked out of here?

292
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,970
You should find that out by yourself.

293
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,110
Hey, I don't care where it is as long as it's very far from here.

294
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,620
You must have a lot of money.

295
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,100
What? Where's my money?

296
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,230
You took the money from selling the album by yourself and run away. I thought you were looking for the money.

297
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,460
You're not right. I jumped to this time before I could even use it.

298
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,070
Then, the money will probably remain as you left it.

299
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,460
I'm asking you this because I'm really curious about it,

300
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,510
but where on earth did you hide the money?

301
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,490
What? Where did I hide what?

302
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,610
On the day of your wrongdoing, don't you remember how Chairman and I stopped by your studio?

303
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,150
What? Did you and Chairman Soondae come over?

304
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,890
Don't you even remember that?

305
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,720
As expected, you look great.

306
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,440
Hey, Hyeon Jae! Are you inside?

307
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,090
Hey, open the door.

308
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,200
Hey, don't you know what kind of person Chairman is?

309
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,210
You should give him back all that as payment and say you were wrong and beg for forgiveness.

310
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,790
- What did I do wrong?
- What?

311
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,140
Come to think about it, what did I do wrong?

312
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,940
I made J2 and I composed all the songs,

313
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,400
but does it make sense for Chairman Soondae to take all the money I earned? Isn't that strange?

314
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,520
Hey, Chairman Soon Tae is the President of the Korean Managers' Association.

315
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,850
He has a lot of producers at TV stations, who consider him like a blood brother.

316
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,590
If you leave like this now, you'll never be able to do it again.

317
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,850
Are you really going to take all this to the end?

318
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,680
Let's see where the road takes us.

319
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,440
Hyeon Jae, you! This rascal seriously!

320
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,650
Chairman. Chairman, why are you being like this?

321
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,930
Okay. I got it, punk. Let me go.

322
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,110
You rascal. I'll give you one more last chance.

323
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,310
That money. Where on earth did you hide it?

324
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,680
Money?

325
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,390
I don't know.

326
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,570
That little rat.

327
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,130
You! If you walk out of that door now,

328
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,720
I'll never see you again.

329
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,720
Goodbye.

330
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,810
That idiot!

331
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,840
Darn it.

332
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,680
Search the room. I'm sure it's hidden somewhere here.

333
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,100
If we can't find that money, our company is going down and we're over!

334
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,350
Find the money somehow! Somehow!

335
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,430
Darn it. That damned punk.

336
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,950
Darn it. Search for it.

337
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,100
Nothing was in the rooftop room.

338
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,440
Then what happened to the money, where did it go?

339
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,610
You should know that, not me.

340
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,000
- Do you really not remember?
- Hey.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,270
If I remembered it, do you think I'd be living in the rooftop room?

342
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,670
Then, do remember that.

343
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,470
That's the least you can do.

344
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,030
The suspect

345
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,090
I came here.

346
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,790
It was a typhoon day.

347
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,140
And the two million dollars is gone.

348
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,480
Bo Hee and I were dating,

349
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,380
and Ji Hoon turns out to be my son.

350
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,810
Gwang Jae lives with Bo Hee, who was dating me.

351
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:15,880
Yeong Jae is using and selling my songs through MJ.

352
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,680
In 1994, when I went missing, the most likely suspect was ...

353
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,100
The suspect

354
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,650
It was Gwang Jae!

355
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,470
Hey, Thumbs Up! Lee Ji Hoon!

356
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,300
You're early?

357
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,920
How did the interview go?

358
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,590
Well, there was an incident.

359
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,190
Anyway, Star Punk Entertainment hired me!

360
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,860
At once?

361
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,660
That's right. They hired me all of a sudden.

362
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,870
Stay still. Star Punch Entertainment is owned by Park Yeong Jae?

363
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,550
Right. The President is the famous Park Yeong Jae.

364
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,880
I see.

365
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,650
Anyway, keep your promise! You said you'd buy us samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly) if you got the job.

366
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,960
Okay. When the guys get home, let's go to eat and get greasy. It has been a long time since we last did.

367
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,130
First, let's keep her by our side and see what happens.

368
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,710
Is that why you hired Choi Woo Seung as an intern?

369
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,720
You must keep the enemy closer than your friend.

370
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,420
What else does she know about MJ? What's her purpose by getting to know him?

371
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,220
I need to know those things so that I can come up with a plan.

372
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,100
From what I could see, I don't think you were living a good life at all.

373
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Why are you so frustrated?

374
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,040
If you want to do it, just do it.

375
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,680
What he said makes some sense, in a way.

376
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,460
Choi Woo Seung, do you also think I'm frustrating?

377
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,160
Well...

378
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,620
In some ways, I think you are.

379
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,220
What? Do I look weird?

380
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,100
Because of my personality, I'm a bad liar.

381
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,620
Then what?

382
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,010
You look pretty.

383
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,230
Didn't you already know I'm pretty?

384
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,220
He's right.

385
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,680
I'm frustrating.

386
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,800
What are you doing? You haven't left yet.

387
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,760
What? I was about to leave.

388
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,510
You haven't eaten, right?

389
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,900
No. Why?

390
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,500
Once a month, I can eat whatever I want.

391
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,180
It's my treat. I'll buy it for you.

392
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,550
- You don't want to?
- Why are you doing this to me?

393
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,690
What?

394
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,790
Don't you have any friends?

395
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,430
Are you bored?

396
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,300
Or do you think I'm easy?

397
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
If you don't want to, then forget it.

398
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,400
Yes.

399
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,340
Lee Ji Hoon! What are you doing?

400
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,370
I am about to go home.

401
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,180
That's great. You haven't eaten dinner yet, right?

402
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,070
It's been a while so Noona will buy you meat!

403
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,340
What's the occasion? You know I like a free meal.

404
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,440
So where should we meet? Can I go to your company?

405
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,460
You can or I can go there.

406
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,220
Hey, Part-timer. Take a look at that! Isn't that amazing?

407
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,390
- Hey!
- I'm on the phone. You are so all over the place!

408
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,970
Stay still.

409
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,900
Are you with Thumbs Up?

410
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,140
What?

411
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,470
Yes. Because I owe him a meal.

412
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,740
What should I do? I don't think I can join you.

413
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,020
What? Why not?

414
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,640
Suddenly something came up.

415
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,150
You guys should go and eat.

416
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,050
Hey. You can't do this to me.

417
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,370
Can't you make some time?

418
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,130
I don't think so.

419
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:24,100
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

420
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,470
♫  Only to you ♫

421
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,770
What did he say? Where did he want to meet us?

422
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,090
He said that suddenly something came up so we should go eat by ourselves.

423
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,080
What?

424
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,840
Hey, Well, it's better to have one less competitor.

425
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,220
Hey, let's just go anywhere. I'm hungry.

426
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,640
Why don't we just buy samgyeopsal and go home?

427
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,090
What?

428
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,060
It's nice to eat delicious things when we are all together.

429
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,010
I'll grill the pork belly really deliciously.

430
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,750
Ah. Then just grill it at the restaurant. There are meat restaurants everywhere. Why at home?

431
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,810
I think I'll faint because I'm starting to death!

436
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,140
That's none of your business.

437
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,000
- Let's go eat.
- What?

438
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,370
You said you'd buy me meat. Let's go together.

I can eat by myself so you should eat it.

443

You said you'd eat as much as you want today.

444
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,870
I was just saying that. Eat this instead of me.

445
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,190
- Just the sight of it makes me feel good.
- Forget it.

446
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,350
Hurry up. Open wide.

447
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,690
I said it's okay.

448
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,550
At least I want to see someone eat it deliciously.

449
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,100
Then I'll wrap up it myself and eat it. See it all you want.

450
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,880
I want to see you eat what I made.

451
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,930
Hurry up. Open wide.

452
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,530
I should make sure to say this before I eat.

453
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,060
What?

454
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,100
Today, it will be the last time I'll do what you ask me to do.

455
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,430
Why?

456
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,500
I have a person I like.

457
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,960
And I'm going to tell her now that I like her.

458
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,120
Meeting each other like this, it may not mean anything to you but—

459
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,300
Hurry up. Open wide first.

Hey, old student.

461
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,960
I think I like you too.

462
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,130

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,890
First, I'll reconstruct the day I went over to this side.

498
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,120
- Ah! Why are you really moving around so much?
- Ah?

499
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,530
I'm going to give up being a trainee.

00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,000
You're the first one I'm telling this to.

Won't you regret it?

00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,720
Rooftop. Floor. Cash. A way to get in.

503
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,840
What's the door passcode of this room?

504
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,330
Do you think I'll tell you that?

505
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,660
I didn't even let you call your mom, "Mom."

506
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,780
I mean I am not even your real father.

507
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,000
I think I like you too. What should I do?

508
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,900
What's wrong with him?

509
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,500
When did you say was your birthday?

510
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,470
I remember who I am now.

511
