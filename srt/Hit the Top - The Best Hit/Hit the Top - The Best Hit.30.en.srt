♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,130
I showed my skills for the first time in a while ...

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,620
Why isn't he coming?

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,130
He isn't answering his phone either.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,560
Ah, everything cooled down.

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,660
Thumbs Up!

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,980
Why are you so late?

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,920
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was busy the whole day.

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,890
Oh my God! What is this aroma? It smells so delicious.

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,410
I was going to eat.

22
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,890
Looks like you're in luck when it comes to eating.

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,190
Luck for eating? More like, I'm in luck when it comes to my girlfriend.

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,210
You can't just say that you're dating me.

25
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,660
- Go on and wash your hands.
- Alright.

26
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,580
Choi Woo Seung. Bang, bang, bang!

27
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,900
What is that?

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,630
Receive the gun of love!

29
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,610
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

30
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,580
I'll go wash my hands.

31
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,550
Receive the gun of love. Bang, bang, bang!

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,730
So that's how you do it.

33
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,550
Bang, bang!

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,970

CEO.

50
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,650
Yes? I was going to call you here. About MJ—

51
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,090
Yes, I'm here because of that.

52
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,560
Please have a look at this.

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,350
What is this?

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,690
Singer MJ puts his life on the line and apologizes out of guilty conscience, "I have never written songs."

55
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,320
What is he doing, this rascal!

56
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,790
It looks like he caused trouble first.
 Related news: MJ's shocking confession ... No official stance from Star Punch

57
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,460
Like this, it makes the company's responsibility look bigger as if we had the central role!

58
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,860
What should we do?

59
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,020
Entertainment Scoop's Department Head Park In Woo

60
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,960
Aish...

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,250
Ah, this jerk causes trouble when he leaves.

62
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,720
Is Gwang Jae not supervising the kid, or what?

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,110
- How is public opinion on the internet?
- Half of it is not good.

64
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,110
But half is backing him up, saying he at least confessed his guilty conscience.

65
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,330
On the fans' side, they are saying they were moved by his courage to confess.

66
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,220
They shouldn't be! Why are they being moved by this?

67
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,840
This is making me so mad, really!

68
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,620
The reporters will keep on trying to get in touch.

69
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,360
Say we don't know, no matter what. Say he deviated by himself.

70
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,260
What's this?

71
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,690
Oh? Mal Sook, where's Grandpa?

72
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,080
I don't know. He wasn't here when I fell asleep yesterday.

73
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,840
And when I woke up, he still wasn't here.

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,950
Did he not come home yesterday?

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,780
Ah, how much alcohol did he consume?

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,210
Your call cannot be connected, you will be sent to voicemail.

77
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,820
Is he sleeping somewhere?

78
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,310
Right. I think President Soondae should go to the hospital to see a doctor.

79
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,740
Why should President do that? Who on earth is as healthy as he is at his age?

80
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,460
I'm not sure of the exact circumstances, but that is it. He must go.

81
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,580
Ah really, why is the old man not answering his phone?

82
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,970
Where are you, huh? Goodness.

83
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,150
How would I know?

84
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
You're Bo Hee, right?

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,330
What's with this ahjussi?

86
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,300
Oh my, what's with him?

87
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,790
It's not her.

88
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,960
How refreshing.

89
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,350
What are you doing, Old man?

90
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,560
Well, excuse me. It's because my legs hurt.

91
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,990
- Pardon?
- I have to get there, but

92
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,600
I don't know where I am.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,770
Excuse me... When you go, take me with you.

94
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm not a taxi. Where would I take you? Get off, now.

95
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,180
Hey person, it's because my legs hurt.

96
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,900
My feet hurt.

97
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,080
Ah dammit, this old fogey.

98
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,370
Hey, get out! Get out!

99
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,710
- Alright, alright.
- Please get out!

100
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,560
- Ah, wait.
- Tsk.

101
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,980
This young folk is quite cold-hearted.

102
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,590
Ah, my throat is dry and I'm hungry.

103
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,900
Where is this, really?

104
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,380
Ow, my legs. Ow, my legs.

105
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,070
Ow, my feet.

106
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,650
He didn't go there either?

107
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,380
No. Yes, I understand.

108
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,690
Ah, where on earth did he go?

109
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,890
Grandpa?

110
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,760
Huh? Yeah.

111
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,170
The thing is, he isn't calling to let me know where he is.

112
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,990
Ah, I'm s-sorry. I'm a mess.

113
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,290
Oh no, I am the one who is sorry. Doing that on my own accord—

114
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,340
Don't say that. If you did something wrong, getting it out is the right thing to do!

115
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,000
Then... the company has no problems, right CEO?

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,570
I told you there are no problems!

117
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,840
Grandfather... he's really okay, right?

118
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,190
Even if problems come up, I'll deal with them myself.

119
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,850
Isn't that something I should do?

120
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,160
Hey, you all shouldn't worry and instead work hard for your debut, okay?

121
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,190
Our MJ...

122
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,100
For the time being, get a good rest. Well, we can't really do anything. You should rest.

123
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,330
Go, go on, go.

124
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

125
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,300
The investment hasn't come in yet, has it?

126
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,260
Huh? Y-Yeah.

127
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,000
And on top of that, MJ's news blew up. Needless to say, they'll be hesitating even more.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,030
But they promised me for sure, so it should be fine.

129
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,360
What if we debuted on the internet?

130
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,960
They do that a lot these days, I heard.

131
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,640
Or there is also a broadcast that Drill is doing, we could start there.

132
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,630
Sorry. I'm making you worry again.

133
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,460
I know that you're working the hardest.

134
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,800
And that if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have been able to start.

135
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,310
I'm trying to start with others' money, without having any pump-priming funds.

136
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,000
Honestly, it is a bit beyond my power.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,340
But still, it'll get better very soon.

138
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,380
It's just that the first step is the hardest.

139
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,740
Oh? Da Bong!

140
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,460
What's going on? You didn't come to work.

141
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,090
Did you come to fetch me?

142
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,490
Of course.

143
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,530
Is there something going on?

144
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,440
- Let's go on a date.
- What?

145
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,040
I want to go on a date. Where do people go nowadays?

146
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,300
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

147
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,270
♫  Only to you, I can give my all ♫

154
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,150
Yes!

♫ You don’t have to say anything, I have no choice but to love you ♫

159
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,810
♫ You wrap your arms around my neck, I have no choice but to hug you ♫

160
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,290
♫ I look at you but I miss you ♫

161
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,450
♫  When I tell myself that, I really do miss you ♫

162
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,140
♫  I don’t wanna miss a single moment ♫

163
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,090
This card means that you two meeting was fate.
♫ I can’t fall asleep until you fall asleep  ♫

164
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,450
Of course, it was fated.
♫  Moments I don’t wanna forget  ♫

165
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,540
It looks like you are very strong, Miss.
♫  I blink and capture the moment in my heart. Good night  ♫

166
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,380
Wow, this gave me goosebumps! Look at this.
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me  ♫

167
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,030
And so, which concerns?

168
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,110
Depending on how you will behave, Mister ...
♫  Only to you, I can give my all  ♫

169
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,170
♫ Remember my love, my eyes, my story ♫

170
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,120
♫  My hope, it’s all you ♫

171
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,420
Whoa, there is so much! So it has been completed!
♫  And what I wanna say is  ♫

172
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,060
♫  I only love you ♫

173
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,710
♫ You’re a girl who looks good in PJs ♫

174
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,170
♫  Fall asleep in my arms today as well ♫

175
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,910
♫  With that innocent face, you act like a fox ♫

176
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,570
♫  So I’m completely deceived ♫

177
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,530
♫  I think about your day ♫

178
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,170
♫  About how you feel these days ♫

179
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,670
So they couldn't win, in the end.
♫  You smile so easily, but sometimes  ♫

180
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,820
♫ Your tears fall on your shoes like a rain shower ♫

181
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,280
♫  I’ll be your summer ♫

182
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,150
It's okay.

183
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,140
♫  Like the cozy clouds in the sky, I’ll be your eternal smile ♫

184
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,420
♫  Will you be my painting? My ocean? ♫

185
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,460
♫  You shine like the stars inside of me ♫

186
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,180
♫ In order for the two little dots, you and me, to meet ♫

187
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,800
♫  We drew lines upon lines ♫

188
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,460
♫ And we became one picture ♫

189
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,390
♫ I love all of those processes ♫

190
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,750
♫ You make me beautiful ♫

191
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:49,050
♫ I like it when you look at me from by my side ♫

192
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,990
♫  I like it when you lean on my shoulder ♫

193
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,940
♫ Remember My love, my eyes ♫

194
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,050
What's that, what's that?

195
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,030
What's this? Sunscreen? What is it?

196
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,510
Wait. What is this?

197
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,860
- Why are you putting so much?
- You might get sunburned.

198
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,740
♫ Oh, oh, oh ♫

199
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,470
♫ Oh, oh, oh. Yeah! ♫

200
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,080
♫ Oh, oh, oh ♫

201
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,660
♫ Oh, oh, oh. Yeah! ♫

202
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,180
I forgot for a bit because of you.

203
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,810
What?

204
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,580
Who I am, where we met, how I lived.

205
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,230
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

206
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,720
Come to think of it, to me, the twenty-first century is you only.

207
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,460
Choi Woo Seung.

208
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,640
What are you saying?

209
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
To me, it's like that.

210
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,080
Yes. I am Lee Gwang Jae, the one who made the report earlier.

211
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,450
Lee Soon Tae. Born in 1948.

212
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,410
No, he hasn't come home yet.

213
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,680
He doesn't have dementia, though. He is healthy.

214
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,860
Yes. Yes, I will be waiting for your call. Yes.

215
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,690
Where is he?

216
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,860
Do I need to borrow money?

217
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,220
Once we're done paying off the debt, there won't even be much left.

218
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,980
Sender: Yoo Hyeon Jae / Recipient: Lee Soon Tae

219
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,340
Right. I heard I sent something to President Soon Tae.

220
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,960
- What? When?
- Huh?

221
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,110
It should be around 1994. I don't remember, you see.

222
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,790
What did you send?

223
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,310
When I went out that time, I said I would pay some amount for the expenses.

224
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,040
Maybe, because it was awkward to meet in person, I sent it by mail. I think it could be this.

225
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,400
How could we find it, then? It's been so many years.

226
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,830
Since you won't meet me, President Soon Tae, I am sending it by mail.

227
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,390
I have paid off the expenses you spent on me all this time, without missing a cent.

228
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,590
Right! I was going to send it to you in cash, but it didn't fit in the envelope.

229
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,230
So I'm just sending it as stocks. It's more fun, you know.

230
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,530
Samsu Electronics Company Share Certificate
500 shares

231
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,230
This, if it's Samsu Electronics, then ...

232
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,370
I-It's f-f-five hundred shares,

233
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,940
so even if it were only 2,500,000 won (≈ $2,500) per share...

234
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,280
1.3 billion?  (≈ $1.3 million)

235
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:23,090
I'm here now. You waited a long time, right?

237
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,870
No, Dad.

238
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,260
But why did my dad get so old?

239
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,600
My handsome, popular dad.

240
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,400
You little... You're the same as always.

241
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,430
It's me, well.

242
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,200
How long did you wait here?

243
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,630
Until you came.

244
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,730
I watched people passing by,

245
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,360
and I thought of the past.

246
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm sorry I couldn't become a daughter you could be proud of, Dad.

247
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,110
I obstinately followed someone you were opposed to, to live with them.

248
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,360
I'm sorry about that, too.

249
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,080
I always wanted to gain your acknowledgment.

250
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,240
We didn't have a lot of time given to us.

251
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,130
Right?

252
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,280
If we'd had more time,

253
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,420
you would've definitely understood.

254
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,190
I'm sorry, too.

255
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,750
All of this ... I was being stubborn.

256
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,780
Hey... as if.

257
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,370
It was because you care for me, Dad. I know that.

258
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,630
You resented me a lot, didn't you?

259
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,420
Not at all.

260
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,960
Not even once.

261
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,320
There is not a moment I wasn't proud of you.

262
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,420
You're the best in my life, you.

263
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:27,220
You're the best thing I did in my life, you.

264
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,830
For taking care of Mal Sook so well,

265
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,330
thank you, Dad.

266
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,700
Mal Sook

267
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,500
At her school, Mal Sook

268
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,850
was told to draw her mom's face, but

269
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,500
she drew me.

270
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,600
You'll forgive me, right? Right?

271
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,250
We're family, why do you ask?

272
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:16,700
Dad, you're also the best in my life.

273
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,190
Hey! Where did you go? Huh?

274
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,280
Where did you go?

275
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,790
What should we do? What is another thing you want to do?

276
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,780
Not sure. I think we did everything already.

277
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,100
Your dream is so simple, what should I do?

278
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,220
Is a dream that important?

279
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,060
If I only meet you, then I'll have no time.

280
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,540
Slowly do things, slowly.

281
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,760
Is today the only day you have?

282
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,590
Okay. Slowly.

283
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,030
Door

284
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,420
Look here, Police Officer.

285
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,470
Yes, Elder?

286
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,150
Well, about that... I have a home.

287
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,050
That— My house—

288
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,190
Yes, please tell me.

289
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,100
Ah, for goodness' sake, seriously.

290
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,620
That house... I have a house.

291
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,540
I can't find the house.

292
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,800
My house!

293
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,600
You! If you look, I get bothered.

294
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,510
I'm trying to capture all of you in my eyes.

295
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,040
- What?
- Even if I close my eyes, I still see you.

296
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,600
Little by little...

297
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,730
Hey, look at this. No joke, look at these goosebumps!

298
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,400
You aren't even acknowledging my sincerity.

299
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,190
What is it?

300
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,210
What is it?

301
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,290
Who is it?

302
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,600
Me. Open the door.

303
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,790
Oh!

304
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,230
Go in here.

305
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,560
My shoes, my shoes!

306
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,870
Be quiet.

307
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,990
- What are you doing, open the door!
- Okay!

308
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,860
Oh...

309
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,930
- What were you doing?
- Huh?

310
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,640
Studying! Studying.

311
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,290
How can you leave people standing in front of the door like that?

312
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,600
Come in, have a seat.

313
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,670
Wow, you said you had moved, but you've hit it big.

314
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,600
Why did you buy all these?

315
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,520
These are things you should give to people who just moved in. You're not going to do a housewarming?

316
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,130
Ah, I'm sorry. I couldn't focus because I have a lot going on.

317
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,880
When I do some cleaning...

318
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,250
Shouldn't you give us something to drink?

319
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,390
Yeah, yeah, wait here.

320
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,400
Ah, it's okay though.

321
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,950
We dropped by on our way back from the practice room. We were curious to see where you moved.

322
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,190
How much is the rent for this kind of room?

323
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,530
Ah, an Unni at work had to leave it because of a situation, so I got it for cheap.

324
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,100
Right! It looks like you took one of my shirts, thinking it was yours.

325
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,300
What? No! There's no way.

326
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,110
No, when you disappeared, it disappeared with you for sure.

327
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,400
It looks like it's with your clothes.

328
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,930
Later, when it comes out, I'll bring it to you.

329
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,040
The thing is, that was my most treasured clothing.

330
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,830
This is your wardrobe, right?

331
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,550
You— How could you open a girl's wardrobe as you please?

332
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,180
Yeah, she said she'd find it for you next time.

333
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,750
I'm saying, let's quickly take a look.

334
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,570
Just once, just once. Oh?

335
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,580
It doesn't open. Wait a minute.

336
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,510
Oh, that is. It doesn't open well. Next time, I'll—

337
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,100
Better to do these kinds of things when men are around.

338
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,890
Step back.

339
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,420
It's really fine.

340
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,390
I won't look inside. I'll just fix this for you.

341
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,310
Drill, grab it here.

342
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,670
Let's count to three and pull.

343
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,310
One. Two. Three!

344
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,950
I said it's fine!

345
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,580
It's really stiff.

346
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,540
We fixed it for you, didn't we? Okay, let's take a look—

347
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,210
Hey! Really, you two!

348
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,100
How can you rummage through a girl's wardrobe like this, as you please?

349
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,930
Even for people without manners, that's too much.

350
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,360
That's true, it's not right.

351
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,010
Wait a second. Move a bit.

352
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,100
Here. Found it.

353
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,270
Look! It did come together with you.

354
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,600
This shirt is limited edition.

355
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,280
- Let's go home now.
- What?

356
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,800
- But we just arrived.
- We have to go out at dawn tomorrow.

357
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,390
Do a proper house-warming later.

358
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,960
Yeah, yeah, sure. Got it.

359
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,700
Let's at least have some instant noodles. The detergent cost us 30,000 won  (≈ $30).

360
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,100
They say it'll rain soon, and there's even a typhoon coming later.

361
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,800
- Let's go now.
- Come on.

362
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,220
R-Right.

363
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,500
Friend. I'll see you next time.

364
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,650
Yeah, sure. Go well.

365
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,780
Here.

366
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,710
Too bad you're already leaving. You should have had some tea at least.

367
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,800
Bye, Choi Woo Seung.

368
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,050
Yes, go safely!

369
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,950
Here. Oh my.

370
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,030
Are you okay?

371
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,680
Do you think they saw you?

372
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,860
I don't think they did.

373
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,680
That was so hard, really.

374
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,950
Last time, Red Dragon wore this t-shirt, did you see?

375
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,480
Wait a second.

376
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,130
Here. Found it.

377
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,700
Gwang Jae.

378
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,870
What is it?

379
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,400
I am sorry for inconveniencing you.

380
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,540
But if you're ill, you should tell me! Then I would know!

381
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,910
Why do you always ...

382
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,860
Ah, I really should have stopped seeing you.

383
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,390
Gwang Jae, kiddo.

384
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,090
You see, let me make a request.

385
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:06,170
My Mal Sook, I'll ask you to take care of her.

386
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,870
It looks like I'm all done, now.

387
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,620
Is it the time for you to be worried about Mal Sook?

388
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,510
I'm not worried about anything other than Mal Sook.

389
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,670
♫  I pray with my hands together ♫

390
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,310
This is nice.

391
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,620
Still, I feel relieved now that I saw you.

392
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,950
Okay?

393
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:39,010
Ouch. Ouch, my leg.

394
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,230
Why am I feeling this uneasy?

395
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,600
What?

396
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,190
Is it because there's a typhoon coming?

397
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,510
What is this?

398
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,810
A compass.

399
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,070
What?

400
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,010
No matter where you go, don't lose your way.

401
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,970
I'm not a little kid.

402
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep first.

403
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,670
What? Okay.

404
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,840
♫ I didn’t know love ♫

405
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,250
Tomorrow, make me some omurice. I want to eat some, suddenly.
♫  I guess I’m still too young  ♫

406
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,420
♫ Whenever I looked at you ♫

407
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,780
Okay.

408
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,200
♫  My heart fluttered for some reason ♫

409
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,160
♫ Your clear eyes ♫

410

♫  They were so kind ♫

411

♫ I couldn’t fall asleep ♫

412

♫  I could only think about you ♫

413
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,400
♫ If you ♫

414
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,390
♫  If you come to me ♫

415

♫  Your black, pretty eyes ♫

♫  You’ve always been by my side ♫

427
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,050
♫  I was too shy to approach you ♫

428
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:16,090
♫  To even hold your hand ♫

429
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:24,400
♫ Do you know my heart? ♫

430

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,340
Additional scenes

454
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,850
Is Lee Soon Tae here?

455
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,410
Hey, Gwang Jae. You're here.

456
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,290
Goodness. What are you doing here?

457
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:50,050
Well what happened was... Things just ended up this way.

458
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,900
What is...

459
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,370
Why is this on your foot? Oh, right.

460
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,660
I'm fine. I'm fine.
- My goodness.

461
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,280
- What happened to your shoe?
- What?

462
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,500
That is, I'm also wondering.

463
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,730
I do remember taking it off just once, but not about after that.

464
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,340
But then you should have called me!

465
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,460
Why do you make people feel so anxious?

466
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,660
I'm sorry, guy.

467
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,090
You're the guardian?

468
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,300
Yes? Yes.

469
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,630
Please sign here, and then you can take him with you.

470
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,520
Ah, yes.

471
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,980
Thank you. Good work. Let's go.

00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,460
- Okay, let's.
- Ah, shoot.

473
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,380
But I'm fine.

474
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,010
It's fine, rascal.

475
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,530
Can you walk?

476
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,850
Of course, I can! I've been walking all day.

477
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,380
Oh my.

478
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,130
Well then, all you work hard!

479
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,840
I'll be taking my leave!

480
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,110
Elder.

481
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,740
What is it?

482
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,130
You should leave the hat here.

483
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,990
But this is my hat!

484
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,930
- It's mine, though.
- Wh-What?

485
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,130
Oh my, would you look at this? Sorry, sorry.

486
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,890
Your hat is here, Elder.

487
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,070
No wonder, my hat felt a bit big.

488
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,780
Let's go! Let's go, let's go.

You have to help me out a bit.

497

How come you have zero interest in me?

498
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,420
I have to look for someone urgently.

499
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,660
What?

500
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,980
