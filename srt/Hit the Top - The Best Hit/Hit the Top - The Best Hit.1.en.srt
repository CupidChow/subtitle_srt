00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,630
The Best Hit

00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,330
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,460
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,260
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

♫ I love you ♫

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,870
♫  It's a beautiful day  ♫

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,550
I've thought about the best hit in my life.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,990
At twenty-three years old,

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,600
everything I expected to be clear was

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,410
still unclear.

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:11,220
I don't even know where I'm going nor what to do.

18
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,620
The world is full of tests, and I'm going to stand against it alone.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,820
Will I have the best hit after all?

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,980
Can I throw that one shot at this crucial moment?

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,990
I, Yoo Hyeon, was able to throw that one shot.

22
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,270
Seoul, 1993

23
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,450
- Compared to the last end of the year, 13%...
- The manufacturing industry is having a hard time with labor...

24
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,000
- Exports of small and medium-sized companies increased from last year.
- It was a time of growth and hope.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,980
Who am I?

26
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,790
The most confident of all were youth,

27
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,550
and the past was a shambles that would disappear.

28
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,340
Everything that was cool was in the future.

29
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,500
In the youth world, there was Yoo Hyeon Jae from J2.

30
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,120
J2, which appeared from nowhere, is quickly taking control of the music industry.

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,110
Scary rookie J2, their song climbs to 46th place...

32
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,380
Yoo Hyeon Jae is writing the songs, doing choreography and is even in charge of their costumes.

33
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,310
This is enough to speak about J2 syndrome.

34
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,160
The older generation may not be able to understand how ahead they are in terms of music.
[Im Jin Mok (Music Critic)]

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,260
They just make me feel good.

36
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,340
Reported to be in the "Top 10" for the first week of May 1993. Seo Tae Ji and the boys received a score of...

37
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,900
It's 1512 votes.

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,770
I will now reveal J2's votes.

39
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,590
It's 1604! J2!

40
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,300
Congratulations!

41
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,910
♫ When I think of you ♫

42
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,420
Yoo Hyeon Jae from J2 is caught in a new dating scandal.

43
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,330
It's already the fourth scandal in this year alone.

44
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,420
This time it is Pure Fairy Hong Bo Hee.

45
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,460
Fans were shocked when Yoo Hyeon Jae of the popular duo announced

46
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,410
a sudden dissolution of the group. His agency, World Entertainment,

47
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,280
has not yet made any official comment regarding this situation.

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,330
What is this? Get rid of this!

49
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,730
Popular singer Yoo Hyeon Jae has gone missing.

50
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,430
He was in the middle of producing a solo instrumental piece in his own studio.

51
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,520
His presence is left here.

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,810
We have discovered the last whereabouts of the famous singer, Yoo Hyeon Jae.

53
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,920
Yesterday afternoon, one month after he went missing,

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,310
Yoo Hyeon Jae's vehicle was found.

55
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,310
Police are taking into account the possibility of drowning.

56
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,040
They are searching in the lake and along the nearby lakeside.

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,690
We love you Yoo Hyeon Jae

58
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,610
Just like that, Yoo Hyeon Jae disappeared with the 90's generation.

59
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,690
I'm sure the picture will come out good since everyone in your family is good looking.

60
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,720
Of course! It must come out well.

61
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,940
What is this? Glaring in the eyes!

62
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,360
The picture will turn out well if it's like this. I'm sorry.

63
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,790
- Why are you turning it now?
- You said it's glaring in the eyes.

64
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,760
It's not glaring. Leave it as it is.

65
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,490
Yes.

66
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,900
Why isn't Gwang Jae coming?

67
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,280
No, that's why I'm telling you this now.

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,690
It hasn't even been postponed for that long. Why would you say that?

69
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,120
Auction?

70
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,260
What did you just say?

71
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,170
I'll pay you back in two weeks even if I have to rob a bank.

72
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,590
What? What? I'm saying that I'll pay the debt to the bank by robbing the bank. So what?

73
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,440
- Aren't you coming in?
- Exactly, you punk!

74
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,370
I miss you too! Right, let's take a drink together soon.

75
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,440
- I'll come soon.
- Come quickly.

76
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,510
Gosh, I'm sorry. It was an emergency call.

77
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,070
Well, everyone is here. Let's take a picture. Okay, look here, please.

78
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,810
Sir, move a little toward your daughter-in-law—

79
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,830
She's not my daughter-in-law.

80
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,140
- Then, move towards your daughter.
- She's not my daughter.

81
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,090
- Oh, then, Madam should move towards...
- No, no, no...

82
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,760
Excuse me, we are not a couple.

83
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,270
- Our little prince, can you move slightly towards your father?
- I'm not.

84
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,510
- He's not your father?
- I'm not a little prince.

85
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,020
I'm a princess!

86
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,210
Gosh, our little princess. I'm sorry, sorry. Then can our princess move towards your father—

87
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,320
He's not my father!

88
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,270
Then...

89
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,150
- Son— You're not the son, are you?
- I am the son.

90
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,120
- Oh, you are the son?
- He's the son.
- He is the son.

91
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Are you in a census team? Hurry up and take the picture.

92
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,530
Okay, I will take it now. Okay, okay. Don't move and smile. Smile!

93
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,640
Okay, one, two, three!

If it is doable, then it's alright. But why was it never doable for me?

111
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,060
- You said you were good at studying?
- I was better than you.

112

You said it's a two o'clock event. We'll be late.

We won't be late. We won't be late.

You are a youth because you are in pain.

♫ You mature as you go through hardship and pain

121
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,010
there were famous lyrics like this as well.

122
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,820
No pain, no gain!

123
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,830
You know, right? No pain. If it doesn't hurt,

124
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,870
no gain. There's nothing you can get out of it.

125
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,160
Youth generally hurts. If you work hard, it must hurt.

126
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,430
Here. There are people who are here without feeling pain, right?

127
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,070
You must all reflect on yourselves!

128
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,420
It's been nine years that I've been teaching in Noryangjin.

129
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,190
But today is a very touching day.

130
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,200
Student! That.

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
Yes? Me?

132
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,160
Student, what is your name?

133
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,610
It's Lee Ji Hoon.

134
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:09,300
Student Ji Hoon, is my lecture so emotional that it brought tears to your eyes?

135
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,240
- No.
- No?

136
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,910
But why were you crying then?

137
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,480
It's because my tear ducts are blocked.

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,910
- Not because you were emotional?
- It's a disease.

139
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,200
Disease.

140
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,010
Hey, fake Hi Joon!

141
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,890
Real Hi Joon!

142
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,020
Why are you here?

143
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,450
Thank you. But really, what happened?

144
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,820
- Is it good to see me?
- As if!

145
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,190
I'm Hi Joon here. It's not good to see you come here abruptly like this.

146
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,500
Or maybe come during lunch and buy me a meal.

147
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,200
What's this concept? You are already borrowing a person's certificate for attending a private institution.

148
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,320
Do I go for free? I even pay the fees!

149
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,070
Gosh. That's not even that much.

150
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,150
Whose fault is it that I'm leading a double life now?

151
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,160
Should I tell your dad that you've been learning how to dance for a while?

152
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,180
- Ah!
- Oh!

153
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,880
Don't play around and be careful!

154
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,540
I almost spilled my precious coffee.

155
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,420
Gosh.

156
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,100
So, do you think you can stay around this time?

157
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,020
I need to. If I fail again, I might actually have to fall off somewhere.

158
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,930
Your words are quite rash!

159
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,050
My situation is rash.

160
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,210
Gosh. Seeing that I always get cut from the cutline, I'm starting to wonder if that's just my luck.

161
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,590
Well, originally the cutline...

162
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,220
Did you... cry?

163
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,510
What?

164
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,740
Ah... again.

165
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,210
I have an eye disease. My tear ducts are blocked or something like that.

166
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,420
I need surgery, but I don't have time for that now.

167
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,020
Gosh. What a mess.

168
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,920
Okay. I'm done here. I'd love to take you to the bus stop, just accept my kind offer.

169
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,470
I'll reject it first. Your boyfriend is doing well, right?

170
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,840
Obviously. I'll get going.

171
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,570
Next time, let's eat what you like.

172
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,990
Like a ghost, you know when I need money.

173
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,820
Did you eat?

174
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,310
Is he busy?

175
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,170
My father never had a job with a regular and secure salary.

176
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,110
He always thought it was better to have a job

177
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,190
with a secure and regular salary.

178
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,770
However, my dream does not guarantee any such salary.

179
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,440
I am a trainee who aims to debut one day.

180
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,850
- Unni!
- Is MJ here?

181
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,590
- Let us see him!
- Let us greet him!

182
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,930
- Oppa!
- It's Oppa!

183
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,200
- Oppa!
- Oppa!

184
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,390
I cut school and came all the way up here from Busan to see you. I really like you.

185
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,130
Could you please show us your face?

186
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,580
I'm not MJ.

187
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,110
Oppa, please don't be like that. Show us your face just once.

188
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,870
- Please!
- Just once.

189
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,910
Who are you?

190
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,110
You're not MJ.

191
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,280
I told you I wasn't.

192
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:47,270
Damn it. If he's not a celebrity, why is he going around with his face all hidden?

193
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,030
This sucks.

194
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,420
♫ On a day like today ♫

195
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,510
♫ When old tears that I thought dried up ♫

196
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

197
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,750
Oh, you are not so late.

198
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,780
- You covered for me, right?
- Oh, my bro!

199
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,970
I just went and showed my crazy good acting. It was like, boom!

200
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:32,080
With this face, I said, "Ji Hoon... sick. He's at the hospital—"

201
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,020
Ugh, stop it. I think I actually will get sick if I keep seeing your face.

202
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,420
Why don't we take the opportunity to just tell the truth? Your dad's a manager. He'll understand.

203
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,370
As I told you, I told him about a company that wanted to cast me, but it almost disappeared!

204
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,070
Oh, right. He is the type to stick with one thing and see it through, no matter what.

205
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,480
Are you kidding me?

206
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,320
I cleared out their schedule already, and you're pulling them out?

207
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,850
Whatever, I don't care. The girls are going to be at the event on Wednesday at 2 pm sharp.

208
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,960
Damn it, those punks.

209
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,310
What's wrong? Was the event canceled?

210
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,570
Why would an annual event be canceled?

211
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,730
I'm sure they kept looking for more artists and finally found a cheaper group.

212
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,180
- Still, they said it was canceled. You can't send them.
-I'm telling you it's not canceled.

213
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,260
- Hey, why are you holding this? It's so heavy.
- I can handle this much.

214
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,850
Forget it. No one asked you to help with things like this.

215
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,860
It seemed that the bank keeps calling.

216
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,370
Is it bad?

217
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,080
Of course not. It's not that serious.

218
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,580
It's because of the loan you took out for this building, right?

219
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,760
If only that hadn't happened with Hyeon Jae.

220
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,790
Why would you bring him up? Forget him, it's been twenty years.

221
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,410
I'm just saying.

222
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,010
Oh, right. Can you hammer a nail for me? I want to hang the family portrait up when we get it.

223
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,660
Why would she bring up Hyeon Jae?

224
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,990
Who is that?

225
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,230
Damn, who—

226
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,680
Turn off your alarm already.

227
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,710
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,380
Damn it, I'm going to be late.

229
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,780
♫ From far away, I can hear ♫

230
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,920
♫ The sound of your footsteps ♫

231
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,690
♫ Why is it so loveable? ♫

232
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,250
♫ The sound of my heartbeat ♫

233
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,250
♫ is so loud ♫

234
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,340
♫ Makes me blush ♫

235
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,980
♫ Beautiful, beautiful ♫

236
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,690
♫ I’m happy because you’re here ♫

237
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,380
Goodbye.
♫ Beautiful, beautiful ♫

238
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,270
I'm sorry I'm late.

239
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,990
You had to pick the busiest day to be late. Start with room 4.

240
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,700
Okay.

241
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,970
Hey, are you growing a mustache under your nose?

242
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,510
♫ Beautiful ♫

243
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,460
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon!

244
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,380
Hey, it's time to get up. You'll be late for academy.

245
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,070
I am up.

246
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,780
Since when have you snored so loudly?

247
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,990
Oh, well...

248
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,590
Father.

249
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,580
- What?
- I'm sorry I snored.

250
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,360
That's nothing to be sorry for. Anyway, come down soon.

251
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,460
I'll be right down.

252
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,090
Shouldn't you be more careful if you're hiding here?

253
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,800
Bro, I just had a weird dream.

254
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,120
I fell from a high place.

255
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,440
That wasn't a dream. You fell in real life.

256
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,370
That's crazy! That's even weirder. If I don't debut this time, I'm screwed.

257
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,060
And I can fail?

258
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,320
Bro, of course, we have to debut together.

259
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,240
Get off me!

260
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,010
I can't. I'll never let go. I'm going to make it this time!

261
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,810
Gosh, damn it.

262
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,990
Woo Seung, are you still in there? Why do you always sleep in that uncomfortable space?

263
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,480
I guess I got too used to it for it to be uncomfortable.

264
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,520
I paid for the charges for this month.

265
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,320
Why? I should pay, too. I already feel sorry for the small room.

266
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,640
You sure have a lot to be sorry for. Do you even have money?

267
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,530
- Thanks.
- There's no need to say that between friends.

268
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,080
Did you eat all the bread that I bought?

269
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,590
Huh? Oh, I was a little hungry at dawn.

270
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,470
You know I always eat breakfast.

271
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,210
Wait right there. I'll make fried rice for you right now.

272
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,690
Forget it. I don't have time for that.

273
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,680
Let's just eat some egg rolls.

274
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,530
- Egg rolls?
- You said you would wash the blankets, right?

275
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,840
- Oh...
- The bathroom is a mess, too. We should just clean everything.

276
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,530
- Could you do these as well?
- Oh, sure.

277
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,080
Son, stop!

278
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,950
Come on, drink this. Pear juice is good for colds.

279
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,530
- You didn't have t—
- Studying requires a lot of stamina.

280
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,370
- You can't work if you can't sleep.
- I guess.

281
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,760
It may be tiring, but just hang in there. What's better than being a civil servant these days?

282
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,950
Your salary is so good, your retirement money is good.

283
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,240
And during holidays, you get bonuses.

284
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
- You should hurry, or you'll be late.
- You'll be late.

285
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,890
- Goodbye.
- Bye!

286
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,490
That kid resembles me more and more these days.

287
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,310
Ji Hoon resembles you? Where?

288
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,970
I mean, just in general.

289
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,440
♫ Oh my my ♫

290
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,820
- Oh!
- Oh.

291
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,730
- Oppa!
- It's Oppa!

292
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,380
Oppa! Come quick, girls!

293
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,190
MJ!

294
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,510
It's me.

295
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,360
- My god!
- It's this "aspiring to fame." We are always being fooled.

296
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,990
- Let's go.
- This sucks.

297
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,730
I can't believe this.

298
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,340
Is MJ the only one who can wear a hat and mask?

299
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,000
- Boo!
- Hey!

300
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,080
Hey, aspiring to fame.

301
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,640
Hey, what's up, everyone! Can you see me okay?

302
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,430
Next to me is someone who has celebrity disease even before he's a celebrity,

303
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,270
Please greet my friend Ji Hoon.

304
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,780
But, shh! It's a secret that he's a trainee.

305
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,880
- What are you doing?
- Me? I just started a live internet broadcast.

306
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,840
I have to practice a variety of skills. Hey, you should introduce yourself, too.

307
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,900
Come on, hurry up.

308
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,350
Hello. I'm Lee Ji Hoon.

309
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,500
How many viewers do we have?

310
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,970
Let's see. Number of viewers is... zero!

311
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,350
I should've known.

312
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,420
Follow, follow me.

313
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,350
Ready.

314
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,600
Five, six, seven, eight.

315
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,720
Out!

316
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,820
Keep going.

317
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,000
Ji Hoon, bigger movements.

318
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,980
Watch your eyes.

319
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,860
Turn around. Go...

320
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,240
Ji Hoon, bigger moves.

321
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,560
Keep it up.

322
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,660
Almost done.

323
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,070
Okay, rest for ten minutes.

324
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,980
Do you see how much we're sweating, everyone?

325
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,740
If you were to collect all the sweat we poured out in this practice room, there would be more water than in all of South Korea.

326
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,640
You're working so hard.

327
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,110
Um, why don't you guys also try living to the music today?

328
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,260
Music is the nation's

329
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,360
precious drug.

330
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

331
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,760
Are they the new trainees? They look like they're in elementary school.

332
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,390
It's not that they look like it, they are. Green shirt is in fifth grade, red shirt is in sixth.

333
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,210
- Aren't they too young?
- That's what I'm saying.

334
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:52,980
Why would they force such young kids into this? How well would they dance?

335
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,210
World Entertainment

336
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,920
Hey, is this a top or shorts?

337
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,860
It can be both!

338
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,430
Bo Hee! I'm heading to Yangpyeong with the girls, I'll be back soon.

339
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,190
I think I'm going to be late, so don't wait for me.

340
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,510
It's going take so long to get to Yangpyeong.

341
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,670
Bo Hee, I said we're leaving now.

342
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,580
Oh, okay. Be safe.

343
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,290
What were you thinking about?

344
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,520
Oh... I was thinking about my comeback.

345
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,720
Comeback?

346
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,150
The last time it was just empty words. I wasn't even active.

347
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,590
- Is that so?
- No, you appeared on Lively Information, remember?

348
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,420
Oh, that morning TV show where they caught fish and stuff?

349
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,740
It was such an amazing comeback.

350
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,620
Last year, you even appeared in a special episode on Disadvantaged Neighbor.

351
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,380
Oh, I remember now.

352
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,880
Because of you, our unfortunate president had to spend 500 dollars to help other needy people.

353
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,720
We went as Unni's backup dancers and ended up standing there in a tiny little dress for four long hours—

354
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,670
Hey, hey!

355
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,460
So what were you saying about your comeback?

356
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,590
The thing is, you know that TV show Susie and Gook Jin appeared on and became a couple?

357
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,740
I looked it up and found that a lot of prior celebrities appeared on that show.

358
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,320
If you make an appearance there, then it's almost guaranteed that your name will be one of the top trending searches on the search engine.

359
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,560
Do you mean Fiery Youth?

360
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,570
Unni, I don't think you know this very well, but it's a really popular TV show. Someone like you—

361
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,440
We're going to be waiting in the car. Bye, Unni!

362
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,950
I just thought that it would be nice to appear in something like that.

363
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,120
Isn't it perfect for a comeback? Right?

364
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,530
Yes, it's perfect.

365
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,160
I'll look into it for you.

366
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,750
Thank you.

367
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,360
- I'll get going.
- Bye!

368
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,450
I never dreamt that I would be competing with elementary school kids.

369
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,350
Oh, I haven't seen Soo Jin Hyung in a while.

370
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:35,540
Soo Jin Hyung? Bro, listen. Listen carefully.

371
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,750
Soo Jin's sad story. Instead of the stage that he dreamed of, he enlisted in the army.

372
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,830
Instead of being what he wanted to be, he became a soldier!

373
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,910
He'll now be in military barracks instead of the practice room.

374
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,950
Instead of saying "Say Ho" every day, he'll be shouting nightly roll calls.

375
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,960
Now, what is the thing he wants more than anything else? A trophy?

376
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,700
No, Choco Pie.

377
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,160
He's serving in the army?

378
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,580
Without telling us?

379
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,320
Do you think he would tell you when he was dragged into the military after being a trainee for five years?

380
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,410
- What's up, man?
- Soo Jin Hyung!

381
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,370
- It was nice hearing that.
- What happened?

382
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,980
Let's go up first.

383
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,630
Why, why? Does my breath smell?

384
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,960
Wow, the weather's so great today.

385
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,450
This style is perfect for a day like this.

386
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:29,020
You always make fun of us by saying that we are old and out of date, but how do you feel being the oldest now?

387
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,890
Same as always.

388
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,920
- Aren't you nostalgic about time?
- What?

389
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Yes.

390
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,760
Are you going to come back after being discharged from military service?

391
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,790
- They threw me away.
- What?

392
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,580
I will be too old after I get discharged.

393
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,730
By the way, why do you want to become a star?

394
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,130
- Well, because I—
- You are an SNU student.

395
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,820
If you have the will, you can do something else.

396
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,960
This isn't going anywhere. You should quickly give up. Otherwise, you will end up like me.

397
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,630
When I look at you, you look like a nice guy, too good to be true. How should I say it? Oh, right!

398
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,630
You look too straight.

399
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,170
- Too straight?
- Yes, that's it.

400
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:14,570
This industry requires crazy people.

401
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,190
Thinking about it, I started my training at 18 years old

402
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:26,960
and worked hard, did my best for five years. But I guess it's not enough.

403
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,640
Everyone is doing their best.

404
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,070
It's poison to have some talent.

405
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,830
You would regret giving up, but it's not enough to succeed. It's like poison.

406
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,810
What are you doing, like a fool?

407
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,590
I'm putting on some background music for you.

408
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,750
Some background music.

409
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,360
My senior is...

410
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,010
like the high sky.

411
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,020
- Soo Jin.
- What? What?

412
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,420
- Hyung Soo Jin, don't ever come back!
- What?

413
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,140
Director. Ah, Director!

414
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,530
Please, Director!

415
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:12,110
Seriously, just once. Can you help me just once?

416
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,060
I would like to.

417
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,380
- There.
- I'm no longer allowed to accept these things.

418
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,220
Who would look into our relationship?

419
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,890
I don't know what you are talking about, "our relationship."

420
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,270
But you can't suddenly ask me to cast someone out of the picture.

421
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:34,390
It's not asking. It's Pure Fairy Hong Bo Hee.

422
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,320
She was a fairy in the past. Now she is almost like a grandmother.

423
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,220
Seriously, Director! No, Hyung.

424
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,520
You can not do this to me.

425
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,180
Representative Lee!

426
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,810
When your first child, Beom Sik was born, you couldn't go because of a live broadca—

427
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,880
Ah really, why are you bringing up past stories?

428
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,970
In the early morning, I went to the hospital with your wife.

429
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:59,850
Your wife. She held my hair and pulled it so hard.

430
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,590
And when your second child, Yoona was born,

431
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,900
Your wife really wanted to eat raspberries in the middle of winter.

432
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,190
In the heart of a severe winter! Where on earth would I find raspberries?! Where would I find those raspberries?

433
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,460
I had to search for those raspberries all over the country. I went to every single fruit warehouse for your child's sake.

434
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,860
Really, stop it.

435
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,810
That's why I'm asking you for a favor.

436
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,960
Favor? Do one for me.

437
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,050
CEO Lee, I do want to help in any way. But the promotion for Hong Bo Hee can't be done here.

438
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,150
- But why?
- Don't you know?

439
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,250
Hong Bo Hee is disliked by the whole nation.

440
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,190
- Disliked? Really!
- During the scandal with Yoo Hyeon Jae, do you know how much gossip there was?

441
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,670
You also know that a crush can be forgotten but hate goes on for life.

442
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,150
Forget about that. If you do want her on the show,

443
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:45,390
find Yoo Hyeon Jae, who went missing twenty years ago. Then I'll at least make it a special program for them.

444
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,700
I'll get going.

445
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,680
Hey, CEO Hwang.

446
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,020
No, who's idle enough to leisurely play football these days?

447
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,300
Gosh. I did so much for him.

448
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,860
He looks like a puffed-up an anchovy head.

449
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,420
Who's an anchovy head?

450
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,590
Noona, It's been long!

451
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,060
Where are you going? Shooting?

452
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:18,390
I'm a radio host! It's been twenty years and you didn't know it?

453
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:22,870
Ah, right! You are still doing that!

454
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:28,930
Right! If it's the radio, you must be inviting guests, right?

455
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,470
Noona, help me just once.

456
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,660
Radio?

457
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,690
These days appearing in these small shows becomes an issue, you know?

458
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:43,560
But still, its a comeback. Wouldn't it be better to show my face than my voice?

459
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,360
Obviously your face is better.

460
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,520
You remember Yoon Jeong Han PD, right?

461
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,360
In the past, he was the youngest assistant producer of the entertainment department.

462
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,280
But, he's now the chief producer of the radio department.

463
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,880
He just wants you to help him this once.

464
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,610
Let's help him out just once, okay?

465
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:04,010
Then, should we?

466
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,020
What should you do is...?

467
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,360
Can you stop singing that song?

468
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,670
Ma'am, It's a big issue! A fight has broken out. Please call the police.

469
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,660
Gosh.

470
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,630
I felt like I was finally getting focused on studying

471
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:38,560
Gosh, you have no sense of the higher-ups. Am I your friend, you punk?

472
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,130
This punk? Do you think it's everything to be born early? We all grow old anyway.

473
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,620
- Ah, this punk!
- What, you punk!

474
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,260
- "What, you punk"?
- Yes! You punk!

475
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,420
Oh, this punk!

476
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,890
Stop! Stop it.

477
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:55,460
Why are you like this when you came here to have fun?

478
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,890
Gosh, I was singing but this punk started singing in the middle of it!

479
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,030
That was my eighteenth song for eighteen years!

480
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,410
This is strictly theft, gambling. No, it isn't gambling. It's theft, you punk!

481
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,630
Theft? This punk!

482
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,620
Stop! Ahjussi, the exact moment you punch him in the face,

483
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,550
you'll violate Criminal Code, clause 257, which states,

484
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,220
"Intentional bodily injury is punishable by imprisonment for up to 7 years and/or a fine of up to 10,000 dollars."

485
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,280
If you have lots of money and time, go ahead and throw that punch.

486
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,230
This punk! What does he think of humans?

487
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,030
Stop what you're doing! Go ahead and turn the table over once.

488
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,930
You'll violate Criminal Code, clause 266, which states,

489
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,160
"To destroy or damage property belonging to a third person is punishable by imprisonment for up to 3 years and/or a fine of up to 7,000 dollars."

490
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,200
Of course, you'll have to pay compensation for civil damages separately, right?

491
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,470
This punk. You can't even do that.

492
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,960
Ma'am, are you a law school student?

493
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,500
How can you know the law so well?

494
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,120
You're studying to be a lawyer, huh?

495
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,090
Not the bar exam. I'm a civil service exam taker.

496
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,220
What's a civil service exam taker?

497
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,820
It's the students' preparations for the civil service exam.

498
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,260
- Why are you here?
- When does your shift end?

499
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,960
Let's grab a snack. It's been a while.

500
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,150
I don't think I should be eating udon with you this leisurely.
(Udon - thick Japanese wheat-flour noodles.)

501
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,240
Just eat while you are it.

502
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,490
But, about you...

503
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,520
Nothing.

504
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,480
What's nothing?

505
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,520
No, its nothing.

506
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,630
Ah, it's... You know, you... Even you think so?

507
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,540
Think what?

508
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,580
Oh, That is... Do I not have charms?

509
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,020
Like honestly, do I not have any charms?

510
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,960
Not even this much? Not even one percent?

511
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,880
Just a minute. What should I do?

512
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,710
Will I be realistic or emotional?

513
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:56,060
Right now, my cold-hearted left brain and my kind and warm right brain are fighting.

514
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,610
I have thought about it... You don't even have one. Charm. Sorry.

515
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,790
No, stop messing around. I mean really.

516
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,730
You're not that great. Really.

517
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,320
- But why?
- I said you don't have charms. What's with the why?

518
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,930
You don't have charms so I told you so.

519
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,470
And you think you have some charms?

520
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,850
You aren't even soft-spoken, kind or cute compared to other girls.

521
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,800
- Even so, it's not like your body is—
- Ow!

522
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,090
Really, this...!

523
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,470
Stop fighting and have some udon.

524
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,350
- We'll enjoy the food.
- We'll enjoy the food.

525
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,000
Start.

526
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,900
Ah, it's hot!

527
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:15,550
Did you see that? A winner is always a winner. Thank you for the udon!

528
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,820
Really, you are so determined. That was really hot.

529
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,780
My life is hotter. Udon is nothing.

530
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,370
Incoming call
Mood Swing Inducer

531
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,030
Someone's calling. You're not going to pick up?

532
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,750
If I pick up, I think I'll be on a swing.

533
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,180
A swing?

534
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,530
A mood swing. A swing (extreme rapid mood shift).

535
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,420
Incoming call
Mood Swing Inducer

536
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,890
What is it? Did something happen?

537
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,890
Daughter. I broke up with Ahjussi.

538
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,550
You did well, my mom.

539
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,610
