1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,630
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,370
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,450
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,650
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,300
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,840
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,710
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,590
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,030
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,330
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,200
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,390
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,970
Ji Hoon, you pour a cup.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,040
Sorry?

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,790
Yes.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,630
I had a lot of resentment against you,

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,340
but let's forget it all.

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,720
I'll forget about it,

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,110
so forget as well, you rascal.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,320
Well, we don't need much formality.

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,020
Let's all bow together and finish it.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,090
Bow.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,680
Hyeon Jae.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,820
Farewell.

25
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,380
You... Here, what...

26
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,490
What's this?

27
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,980
Ah, sorry. He's my friend.

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,490
No way!

29
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,990
Y-Your friend? F-Friend?

30
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,430
Oh! Oh! It's the friend I saw that time!

31
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,210
Ji Hoon's friend, his friend.

32
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,420
Aigoo, what's this. What to do.

33
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,610
What's this. Oh boy!

34
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,970
Hello, I-I was looking for the bathroom,

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,480
and the rooftop was locked, yes.

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,660
Ah, yes, that could be, it can happen.

37
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,380
It can happen since you're his friend.

38
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,530
Here, careful. Here.

39
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm sorry. Come out.

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,450
My phone!

41
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,110
What's this!

42
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,300
Wh—

43
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,800
Sorry.

44
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,190
Hyeon Jae!

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,190
Yoo Hyeon Jae?

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,770
You aren't him, right?

47
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,140
What are you saying? What's wrong with you?

48
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,380
No, but... He looks so much like him.

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,630
What are you saying, where?

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,710
What looks like him? He doesn't resemble him at all! Look, look!

51
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,730
Yes, Yoo Hyeon Jae, I hear that a lot.

52
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,180
I'm not him, not at all.

53
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,320
He's my friend, but because of some circumstances, he's been staying in my room—

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,030
What? Then the one who's been frightening me every night is this guy?

55
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,210
I'm sorry, I should have told you.

56
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,820
Come out quick.

57
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,240
He's Ji Hoon's friend, preparing for the civil service, the exam.

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,080
His friend, his friend. I saw him once last time. I saw him.

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,390
Whoa, it's odd how he resembles him.

60
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,180
But wait! What the hell is he doing, falling onto someone else's rite table?

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,430
I know, right? That's something.

62
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh but, you said you would celebrate my birthday. Aren't you doing it?

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,420
Oh, what to do, it became a mess. What to do.

64
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,570
Cake! Cake!

65
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,390
Tada! For a birthday, this is mandatory!

66
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,970
Whoa, this is an honor. How many years has it been since I had my birthday celebrated?

67
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,110
Let's see, what kind of cake is it? Oh!

68
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,730
As expected, a cake has to be with whipped-cream!

69
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,180
President! Tada! Birthday present!

70
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,680
Whoah, look at this! It's deer antlers!

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,690
How old ... is he?

72
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,120
He really resembles him too much.

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,320
Ah come on, stop it.

74
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,210
Eat this, it's good for your health.

75
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,940
This guy...

76
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,810
Ah! The song, the song!

77
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,960
- The song, the song!
- One, two, three, four!

78
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,940
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

79
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,830
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

80
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,120
♫ To our beloved president, happy birthday to you! ♫

81
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,830
- Yoohoo!
- Yay!

82
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,610
He's Ji Hoon's friend, so ... He's really young, right?

83
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,060
Once more!

84
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,280
- Again?
- One, two, three, four!

85
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,370
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

86
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,140
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

87
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,970
♫ To our beloved president, happy birthday to you! ♫

88
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,330
Okay!

89
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,170
Happy birthday!

90
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,180
- Quick, quick! A wish, you have to make a wish!
- Okay.

91
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,840
Mal Sook, you...

92
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,940
- Quick, take the candles out.
- Let's eat the cake.

93
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,340
- Oh my, how old is he?
- There are too many candles.

94
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,900
He's old, you know.

95
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,210
ID Card - Lee Ji Hoon

96
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,040
Cut the cak—

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,020
Hey, hey! Where are you going so suddenly?

98
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,550
Are you crazy? Where do you think that is!

99
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,850
Listen to me, there's a misunderstanding.

100
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,470
What misunderstanding?

101
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,260
I didn't fall because I wanted to!

102
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,550
I told you not to go out no matter what!

103
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,770
I went to stop you! You should be thankful to me!

104
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,670
Do you know what you just messed up?

105
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,840
So why would you hide this, when it's nothing much?

106
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,700
Isn't it all to hide your trainee ID?

107
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,970
Hey, "Father, Mother, I don't want to be a civil servant."

108
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,020
"I'm sorry, but I want to be a singer."

109
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,440
"So I'm quite busy. When I become successful later, I'll make you live in luxury!"

110
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,200
If you say this, is it a big deal?

111
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,440
Why do you live in such a frustrating way?

112
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,740
If you're going to be like this, just get out of here.

113
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,300
What?

114
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,490
Hey, did you forget?

115
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,390
I'm someone who is unwell because of you guys.

116
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,180
From what I see, you're perfectly fine.

117
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,320
I'm not fine.

118
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,150
That's right, he's not fine.

119
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,570
Is it really true that you can't remember?

120
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,240
I'm also going crazy at the absurdity.

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,940
- Absurdity? What's absurd!
- Hey—

122
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,890
- Hey, Lee Ji Hoon!

123
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,020
- What's all this?
- I'm sorry, my friend had a stomach ache.

124
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,180
I'm sorry, I'll try to sort it—

125
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm asking what this is!

126
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,550
- F-Father.
- Ah, he got caught.

127
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,430
You, all this time you've been doing this thing?

128
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,850
- What about the civil servant academy?
- I'm sorry.

129
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,600
Since when?

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,030
I'm asking you, since when!

131
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,900
It's been three years.

132
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,660
You, are you doing this knowing what it is? Uh?

133
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,910
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,960
Look, it's not the place for me to butt in, but—

135
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,390
That's all, you go tomorrow and quit.

136
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,050
And then, we'll talk again.

137
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,480
Father, please wait a minute.

138
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,140
I don't want to lie this time.

139
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,890
I'm sorry,

140
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,870
but just this time—
- No.

141
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,600
I just want to do it.

142
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,450
Of course, for now I haven't been able to debut yet, but—

143
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,680
It's something you want to do?

144
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,150
- Yes.
- You said you've been digging in for three years.

145
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,100
If you've dug in for three years but there's no response, fold it.

146
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,550
Dig somewhere else. That's not the right place.

147
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,880
- Father.
- Do that.

148
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,970
Y-You guys. What's this?

149
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,040
Ah. G-Good evening.

150
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,810
What are you doing here at this hour?

151
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,240
Oh, we came to hang out for a bit.

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,230
Yes, to hang out, for a bit.

153
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,100
We also had some things to discuss.

154
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,850
You guys, don't tell me...

155
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,460
President! I mean, Ajussi.

156
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,410
That is, Mister.

157
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,750
He's been staying at our house for a short while.

158
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,230
He's called Drill, he is my friend and also a trainee.

159
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,140
Greet him, Drill.

160
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,470
Why do you...

161
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,660
Good eve- ning.

162
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,020
Ah, Mister, for me— Uuh, that is...

163
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,260
Woo Seung also, she didn't have a place to go anymore.

164
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm sorry, Father. I didn't do this to deceive you all this time.

165
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,840
I'll keep on training. Please let me do this.

166
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,760
- I'm sorry.
- We are sorry.

167
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's talk again tomorrow.

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,060
And you as well, go back to your own houses tomorrow.

169
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,690
- Especially you!
- Father.

170
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,860
And you quit right away! I won't say any more.

171
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,720
Father!

172
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,740
♫ I have a dream ♫

173
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,840
♫ I have a dream ♫

174
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,750
Is it because of money?

175
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,110
What?

176
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,880
But that's weird! He says he wants to do it, why aren't you letting him?

177
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,930
What's more, it's as a singer. You could even help him out.

178
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,300
Why do you keep on telling him to be a civil servant when he doesn't want to? Is it because of money?

179
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,810
Hey. Get a grip.

180
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,190
Even if you say you don't remember, Ji Hoon is your son.

181
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,890
Do you wish for your child to live like you?

182
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,970
Yeah. Why can't he?

183
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,060
Right, you spoke well. He is my child, in fact.

184
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,880
Because he's my child, you can't beat his instinct with rationality.

185
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,090
Don't you see? You've been pressing it down firmly, but it bursts out every time.

186
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,300
His talent, that is condensed somewhere deep inside his heart, he himself can't reject it.

187
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,650
Anyway. Ahh, he really is mine.

188
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,460
Little punk.

189
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,970
- Damn it!
- Hey.

190
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,520
Don't say whatever you want. Ji Hoon is my child!

191
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,320
You're the one who said he is mine!

192
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,970
That we live like this now, does it look good to you?

193
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,700
No, I mean.

194
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,500
Bo Hee can't even tell her son that he is hers.

195
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,680
And me, in my own way... And Ji Hoon, this guy, too!

196
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,390
Forget it. Shut up.

197
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,420
No, but you can't tell Ji Hoon that he is Bo Hee's son?

198
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,350
- Why?
- Shut up,

199
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,680
and leave this house. It has become too dangerous. That won't do.

200
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,380
- No.
- Why?

201
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,010
The people who know why I came to this year 2017, they are all here.

202
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,590
Help me, Gwang Jae.

203
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,230
I lived my whole life helping you and became like this, but again?

204
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,510
Buzz off while I tell you nicely.

205
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,350
I have to find the money, too.

206
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:07,340
The first payment from our album, that I left before coming over. It's somewhere here, for sure.

207
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,230
Hey. It's no less than two billion won. Two billion!

208
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,990
Let's find it together, uh?

209
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,620
What the hell are you talking about?

210
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,720
About Ji Hoon's friend we saw earlier,

211
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Doesn't he look a lot like Hyeon Jae?

212
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,360
You said it was weird.

213
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,450
What do you mean they look like?

214
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,770
It's been 20 years. I can't believe you still remember that punk's face.

215
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,820
You said it clearly with your mouth earlier.

216
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,850
You'd forget him and let him go after his memorial service. Did you or didn't you?

217
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,140
From now on, don't ever mention Hyeon Jae's name with your mouth again.

218
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,870
Hey, is Gwang Jae coming home or not?

219
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,270
Hey, hey, hey! You. Where have you been?

220
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,850
By the way, why aren't you sleeping?

221
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,810
What happened?

222
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,180
Why did you suddenly run out like that?

223
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,480
I'm sorry. Good night.

224
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,060
I... Do you want me to get the cake again?

225
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,970
No. It's okay. It's already late.

226
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,210
What a fool. We threw you a party to feed you a good meal and you couldn't even eat it and just left.

227
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,140
What the hell did you pick up from the floor earlier that made you jump up and run so suddenly?

228
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,750
I said it was nothing. You should rest.

229
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,650
- Go to sleep immediately.
- Okay.

230
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,430
Let's go in.

231
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,570
Aigoo. What a pathetic guy. My legs hurt.

232
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,370
Go to sleep immediately.

233
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,130
ID Card
Lee Ji Hoon

234
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,570
The Best Hit

235
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,340
Hey, trainee!

236
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,760
But you feel relieved, right? Now that he knows everything.

237
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,940
Do you want to be alone?

238
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,470
My father is not my real dad.

239
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,840
I know. How many years have I been your friend?

240
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,020
I heard that before I was born he abandoned me and my mom.

241
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,710
He just left us and went somewhere.

242
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,790
Was he originally a selfish person who only cares for himself?

243
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,590
This is the first time that I've ever wanted to do something.

244
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,350
Yet, it's the first time I can't do it. No matter how much effort I put in it.

245
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,520
To a father whose whereabouts I don't even know,

246
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,390
I think I wanted to show him that I've become famous and successful without him.

247
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:17,520
It may be childish, but I wanted to get some kind of revenge.

248
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,270
What have you doing during all this time?

249
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,550
I'm trying to remember.

250
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,680
Did you already forget it? I have am amnesia.

251
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,680
Why is it raining so hard?

252
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,720
But... Why did CEO Lee keep saying you have to leave?

253
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,250
Ah, seriously. It must be here for sure.

254
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,180
You startled me.

255
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,300
Hey! I'm sorry but just get out of here for a moment.

256
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,860
I need some time to concentrate.

257
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,180
Bro. I'm asking you just in case I heard you wrong.

258
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,720
What did you say?

259
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
Oh my gosh. I said to get out!

260
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,530
Hey, you really.

261
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,330
What is it? What is it? What's wrong with you? Thumbs Up. Thumbs Up?

262
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,460
Thumbs Up?

263
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,050
Ah, that ignorant punk.

264
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,180
Don't talk to me.

265
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,450
I didn't say anything.

266
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,190
You were going to.

267
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,150
No. I was going to talk to myself.

268
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,730
Who are you?

269
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,830
What?

270
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,820
Who are you to barge into someone else's life and cause all this trouble?

271
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,260
Were you living well?

272
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,630
What?

273
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,190
From what I could see, I don't think you were living a good life at all.

274
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,010
I heard you attend Seoul National University? But you don't want to follow the boring path again.

275
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,920
Then, why did you study?

276
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,760
Okay, if you want to be a singer. then do it.

277
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,410
The problem is that you are too smart.

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,520
You must take after your dad.

279
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,430
Anyway, everyone is mistaken.

280
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,000
You don't need to pass a test to become a singer. Just do it.

281
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,380
You make a song and choreography and then you do it.

282
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,350
Dance class, rap class, vocal class. They're ridiculous.

283
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,850
Stop lecturing me.

284
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,900
You must be happy to think that life is so easy.

285
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,910
It's because Thumbs Up doesn't think like you.

286
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,500
Shut up.

287
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,920
What he said makes some sense, in a way.

288
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,510
It may be better this way. That's a good thing for you, Lee Ji Hoon.

289
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,460
You can persuade your dad and do it.

290
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,800
Choi Woo Seung, do you also think I'm frustrating?

291
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,470
What?

292
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,480
That's what you two are talking about now.

293
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,190
Well...

294
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,690
♫ Flowers that haven’t bloomed ♫

295
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,390
I guess you are in some ways.

296
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,120
♫  Will bloom someday ♫

297
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,970
You see. Even your friend of 20 years thinks you are frustrating.

298
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,970
I think you two are better friends now, not me.

299
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,630
What are you saying now? That's so childish.

300
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,370
♫ Light in the sky ♫

301
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,860
Hey, forget it. That's enough. I will tolerate it. Are you satisfied?

302
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,450
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

303
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,200
♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

304
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,680
I'm childish by nature.

305
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,390
♫  Some day, fly fly fly ♫

306
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:20,230
Yes! J2 wins the Golden Cup! Please, everyone, give them a round of applause.

307
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,890
Here it is the Golden Cup.

308
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,320
Awesome! Thumbs Up!
Please accept the flower bouquet too.

309
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,880
Cheers!

310
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,250
- Yes! Cheers!
Great, I like this!

311
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,490
I'm moving to another company.

312
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,680
What? What did you say?

313
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,670
I'm signing with another company.

314
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,130
If things go wrong, everyone keep in mind that you'll be all responsible too! You better know this.

315
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,090
Those punks are a big bunch of bollocks.

316
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,390
Hey! You still haven't heard from Hyeon Jae?

317
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,750
I keep paging him at his beeper but—

318
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,540
- He must be at his house! Have you been to his house?
- He is not at home.

319
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,010
No. Then, what about his studio?

320
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,400
He wouldn't come here.

321
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,010
What is going to happen to J2 now?

322
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,180
What do you mean? You don't need to ask that, you punk.

323
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,840
Hyeon Jae, that rat jerk, must have already run away somewhere!

324
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,800
No, no, no. I can eat it all.

325
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,180
I can do it.

326
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,800
Aigoo, this kid.

327
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,970
Aigoo. You also lead a tiring life.

328
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,500
World Entertainment

329
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,180
I'm going to put the rooftop room up for rent.

330
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,590
I asked around and we could get around 500 or 600 dollars per month.

331
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,620
It's not a small amount of money these days considering our situation.

332
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,670
What about Ji Hoon?

333
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,050
Ji Hoon can stay in my room for the time being.

334
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,640
How can you share a room with him when he has to study?

335
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,880
I think we can use it together.

336
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,210
Ji Hoon. You're okay with it too, right?

337
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,460
I don't want to.

338
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,200
- You don't want to?
- Yes.

339
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,900
- I don't want to.
- Why you don't want to?

340
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,540
- There's a reason that I don't want to do it.
- What's your reason?

341
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,420
- I don't want to tell you.
- You don't want to tell me the reason?

342
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,090
Yes, I don't want to.

343
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,480
Forget it. I already made myself clear.

344
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,040
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

345
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,330
I have my reason behind doing this all of a sudden.

346
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,760
I'm sorry but I think you'll have to wait longer to get an implant.

347
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,850
To be honest, I haven't been actually studying for the civil service exam in order to become a public service official.

348
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,050
I didn't take the exam last time either.

349
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,170
Oh, right. Also, Mom can you please pack some of these side dishes from here?

350
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,140
I'm living together with my three friends on the rooftop.

351
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,300
I thought I should take care of their food.

352
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,090
What?

353
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,320
Father, let me stay with my friends in the rooftop for the time being. They're good kids.

354
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,820
About my breakfast... I'll go up and eat it with my friends.

355
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,710
Bro. You didn't have breakfast downstairs with your family?

356
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,410
It just happened that way.

357
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,190
Ji Hoon!

358
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,010
What is this?

359
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,030
There isn't anyone else. What about your friends?

360
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,030
Bro.

361
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,430
Come out now. She already knows everything.

362
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,100
Hello.

363
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,560
Are you his sunbae?

364
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,260
Not at all.

365
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,100
I'm his friend, MC Drill.

366
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,770
Oh. You must be a comedian.

367
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,630
What? No, I'm not.

368
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,210
Where are your other friends?

369
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,550
- Ah, one of them already left.
- Is that so?

370
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,380
Hello.

371
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,580
Oh my god. Woo Seung!

372
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,920
It's been a while since I last saw you. Your mom is doing well, right?

373
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,330
Do you know each other?

374
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,160
Yes. Her mom used to be my stylist in the past.

375
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,710
I'm sorry. I had some personal reasons so I asked Ji Hoon.

376
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,520
Aigoo. I'd have been surprised if it had been another girl, but I'm relieved it's you after all.

377
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,650
Hey you two guys! When you were young, you two used to take off your clothes and take a bath together.

378
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,710
It's okay. It's just for one day.

379
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,560
Let's have breakfast.

380
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,420
Thank you.

381
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,170
Ah. I'm sorry but I have to go out quickly.

382
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,210
Where? Are you going to take a class?

383
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,440
No. I have an interview to attend today.

384
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,960
My gosh. Like this?

385
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,500
♫ I can hear the sound of your footsteps from afar ♫

386
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,100
Not this one.

387
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,100
♫ Why are you so lovely? ♫

388
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,420
How about this one?

389
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,290
- You'll make her fail the interview.
- It's pretty.

390
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,920
In my humble opinion, it's best to dress up as neatly as possible during an interview.

391
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,010
♫ I always looked only at you ♫

392
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,820
I'm sorry to bother you when you're this busy.

393
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,110
We wouldn't dare ignore Unni Bo Hee's request for help.

394
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,750
Hey, let's do your make up first. Come here.

395
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,550
♫ I’ll call out loud for you ♫

396
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,520
Oh no. That's Okay.

397
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,730
I don't care about my face. I rarely wear makeup.

398
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,810
Also, I tend to wash my face very often so it'll come off easily.

399
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,600
Ta-da! We'll take care of it.

400
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,670
♫ Beautiful  ♫

401
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,840
Let's finish it off with your lucky color.

402
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,080
♫ The whole world becomes clear ♫

403
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,600
♫ Beautiful  ♫

404
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,220
Hey. Gwang Jae, that jerk! He told me to come down. Why isn't he here?

405
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,470
♫ Greeting everyone step by step ♫

406
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,230
♫ Beautiful Beautiful ♫

407
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,000
What is it? Did he call me on purpose to make sure I don't meet Bo Hee?

408
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,090
I don't want to be alone.

409
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,650
♫  Beautiful ♫

410
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,200
Hey, Thumbs Up!

411
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,430
♫ To the lovely you ♫

412
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,140

00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,550
♫ Beautiful Beautiful ♫

415
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,130
♫ I sing for you till the end of the blue sky ♫

416
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,340
What? Do I look weird?

417
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,820
Because of my personality, I'm a bad liar.

418
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,930
Then, what?

419
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,110
You look pretty.

420
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,890
♫ So that you can hear ♫

421
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,340
Didn't you already know I'm pretty?

422
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,320
Right. Stop hanging around. Hurry up and go upstairs. Do the dishes and clean the room completely.

423
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,880
- Why?
- Did you forget?

424
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,130
You're my slave.

425
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,230
I, Thumbs Up, will pay back Choi Woo Seung...

426
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,600
Yes, yes. I understand.

427
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,600
What's with you?

428
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,100
Instead, if I get this job, I'll buy you meat for dinner!

429
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,580
I'm late. I'm going now.

430
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,010
Lee Ji Hoon, let's go together.

431
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,840
Hey. So narrow-minded.

432
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,270
Hey, let's go together!

433
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,760
"Let's go together"? Where are they going?

434
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,920
Yes. Choi Woo Seung has a job interview.

435
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,010
She adapts quickly.

436
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,260
And it's at Star Punch Entertainment.

437
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,960
What? Does she want to become a singer too?

438
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,230
No, it's not like that. I think all of a sudden an announcement came out looking for interns.

439
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,720
Ah, please. I hope she fails it.

440
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,010
I don't want to see you at the company too.

441
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,470
So ill-mannered. You shouldn't live like that either!

442
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,850
- No, you shouldn't live like that either!
- No, don't live like that!

443
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,960
- No, don't live like that.
- No, don't live like that.

444
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,520
- You.
- No, you.

445
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,380
- Hey, you shouldn't live like that either!
- No, you.

446
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,700
- You!
- You!

447
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,930
- You.
- You.

448
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,570
Aigoo. I should also get a part-time job somewhere else.

449
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,210
I'm really not cut out to be a slave.

450
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,190
Darn it!

451
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,620
This is strange.

452
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,620
I clearly remember there was a beeping sound here.

453
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,380
What's that sound? Where is that sound coming from?

454
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,550
Hey, this is really broken... Oh, you startled me.

455
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,460
Hi.

456

Hello.

457
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,860
Ah, right. What are you doing?

458
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,210
What?

459
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,950
Ah. This beeper... no.

460
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,290
I meant... I was exercising.

461
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:10,020
No, it's not that. Well, I was about to do the dishes. But, I'll first wash the laundry quickly.

462
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,940
- Yes.
- I see, sure.

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,890
♫  Only to you, I can give my all ♫

475
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,980
Yesterday, I'm sorry, you were too surprised because of me.

476
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,810
What?

477
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,590
Ah, right. I was surprised.

478
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,220
Right. By the way, do you like bread?

479
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,040
Our bread is very delicious. Would you like to come down and eat it?

480
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,800
Yes.

481
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,630
No. Gwang Jae would hate it.

482
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,500
- What?
- Yes?

483
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,790
No, no.

484
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,990
Where on earth is there a person who doesn't like bread?

485
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,400
♫ Oh, oh, oh. Yeah! ♫

486
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,050
♫ Oh, oh, oh. Yeah! ♫

487
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,500
♫ Oh, oh, oh. Yeah! ♫

488
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,760
Enjoy the bread.

489
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,460
Yes. Thank you.

490
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,320
♫ Yeah ♫

491
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,780
♫ Listening to you as you’re in my arms ♫

492
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,720
♫  Having you in my arms ♫

493
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,770
♫  Our eyes, our memories, our hopes ♫

494
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,580
♫  I’ll remember it all ♫

495
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,810
It's right. This guy is really Hyeon Jae.

496
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:19,430
When you smile, your lips curl up from the corners of your mouth, just exactly as Hyeon Jae's did.

497
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,580
You're Hyeon Jae, right?

498
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,700
Right?

499
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,580
- Right?!
- No, I am not.

500
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,780
What do you mean no? What a big liar.

501
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,710
Be honest and tell us, you punk!

502
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,050
- Tell us!
- Be honest about what?

503
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,970
How dare you? I've lived my whole life making a living by studying people with just an eye.

504
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,860
I don't know if you can fool anyone else, but you can't fool me.

505
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,180
You can't fool me.

506
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,800
Mal Sook. When adults are talking, why do you keep interfering?

507
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,060
Be quiet, you are distracting me.

508
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,510
You... Tell us the truth! I already know everything, you punk.

509
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,670
I'm really not him. Hey, Soondae...

510
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,960
What? You just called me "Soondae"?

511
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,780
You see. I was right! You, Hyeon Jae, always used to call me President Soondae, you punk!

512
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,490
You! You have been caught red-handed by me!

513
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,940
Look at you.

514
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,180
- We are back!
- We are back!

515
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,880
We are back home!

516
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,660
Hey! Why are you down here?

517
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,550
Well, I was told to eat some bread.

518
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,600
Gwang Jae. This punk is really Hyeon Jae.

519
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,010
No. President, what's wrong with you again?

520
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,300
This punk just called me Soondae.

521
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,020
"President Soondae." Only Hyeon Jae used to call me that back then.

522
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,090
What?

523
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,530
This punk called me Soondae. Soondae. Soondae.

524
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,120
- Oh, I'm sure you heard wrong.
- Again I heard wrong?

525
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,420
Excuse me. Can you look after the store for a while? Bo Hee and I have to go out for a meeting.

526
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,060
- What kind of meeting?
- Bo Hee got an offer for a commercial.

527
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,280
Really? Good job. You did well.

528
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,130
Come here, let's go.

529
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,410
The Best Hit
