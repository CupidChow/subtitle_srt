00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,410
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,500
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,660
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,110
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,810
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,820
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,790
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,090
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,400
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,200
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,470
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,200
Next time, bring me separate pictures of each member.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
I can't see our products very well.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,610
Yes, I understand.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,710
The products are intact, right?

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,530
Yes, they are.

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,750
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Yes.

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,120
Ah, by the way...

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,510
Which design is popular among women's rings these days?

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,860
Rings? We have no plans to sponsor rings.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,310
No. Not sponsorship.

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,160
I just want to take a look at them.

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,670
- They're displayed here and there.
- Okay.

25
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,330
Yes.

26
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,950
Unexpectedly, you're talented and good at it.

27
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,130
I even got a bonus for handing out a lot of flyers.

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,760
Hey. It's because I haven't tried. I can do anything.

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,240
If I put my mind into it, I'm really good at it.

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,020
Anyway, I'm afraid to praise you this much.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,560
But, I have a question.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,090
It's about Ji Hoon. Is that child preparing to become a public servant?

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,090
Ji Hoon is a trainee.

34
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,960
It's a secret from his family.

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,320
What? A trainee?

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,160
What is that?

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,990
You don't know what a trainee is?

38
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,540
An aspiring idol.

39
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,660
An idol... You mean a singer?

40
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,150
Then, they have to train to become a singer?

41
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,620
It's been three years since he started training to become one.

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,060
Ajussi is against it.

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,310
If it's Ajussi. Is he Gwang Jae?

44
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,320
How dare you?

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,140
Hey. What is it?

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,570
How dare you call an adult's name so informally? Have some manners.

47
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,540
Is Ajussi your friend?

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,140
Anyway, Gwang Jae...

49
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,920
Ajussi is against it, right?

50
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,030
Maybe it's because he's always worked in the entertainment field.

51
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,910
It seems that Ajussi doesn't like Ji Hoon working as a singer.

52
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,580
Back in high school, Ji Hoon took a few auditions to become a trainee in several agencies.

53
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,490
But, his father went to every single agency and turned everything upside down. He said he'd never allow it.

54
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,900
Really?

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,790
But, since when have you been so interested in Ji Hoon?

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,400
Who is interested in him? Me?

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,460
No, it's not like that.

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,520
Right. On my way back from the academy, I saw a brand-new product that I thought you'd like, so I bought one for you.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,840
It's part of your bonus for the part-time job today. Go and check it in your room.

60
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,160
A brand-new product?

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,090
What brand-new product?

62
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,250
What is it?

63
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,750
She must have meant a brand-new pair of sneakers.

64
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,640
They're not my style but she bought them with sincerity for me after all.

65
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,920
How does that part-timer know my shoe size?

66
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,760
You're back home now? Where have you been having fun all day?

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,530
It was a very hard day.

68
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,860
Right. I have heard something about you.

69
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,170
Hey, what are you doing?

70
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,340
Aren't you going to take them off?!

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,940
What?

72
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,660
Why were you wearing these?

73
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,910
If you keep being like this, I can't share a room with you.

74
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,840
Move aside. Don't touch them.

75
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,450
No. You can't be like that.

76
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,510
What happened again?

77
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,880
No. It's a new-brand thing you bought for me but why is he doing that to me?

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,000
A brand-new product? What brand-new product?

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,210
The sneakers.

80
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,370
The sneakers? What are you...?

81
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,590
Are you talking about the new pair of sneakers?

82
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,850
Yes.

83
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,460
Those are what Ji Hoon bought as a present for Ajussi's birthday.

84
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,380
What?

85
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,690
A birthday present?

86
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,490
Then where is my brand-new product?

87
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,320
It's there. A brand-new flavored triangular gimbap.

88
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,030
It's said to taste like melon fire ribs and spicy galbi. I wonder what it tastes like.

89
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,060
What?

90
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,410
You confused me.

91
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,020
Friend.

92
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,900
Let me use my friend's lap to rest for a while.

93
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,700
What's wrong with you?

94
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,130
Just a moment.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,500
I'm so tired today.

96
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,960
What have you been doing all day?

97
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,010
This and that to make a living.

98
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,660
Right. About the sneakers, don't be so angry.

99
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,760
It's not like Thumbs Up did it on purpose. There was a misunderstanding.

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,910
Whatever.

101
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,020
So, did you get a new part-time job?

102
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,970
I already told you.

103
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,760
Just this and that. I'm doing everything I can.

104
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,260
Get some rest.

105
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,620
Who doesn't want to rest?

106
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,720
If I could, I'd go to some island in the Pacific or something.

107
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,920
And I want to sleep there for three days before coming back.

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,960
I'd enjoy my time lying down in a hammock.

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,560
Lee Ji Hoon, are you happy... now?

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,380
All of a sudden, you're making me have goosebumps.

111
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,940
What's so special about happiness?

112
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,900
That's right.

113
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,440
What's so special about happiness?

114
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,900
Now that I've lived,

115
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,760
I've found out that happiness is something that's not far away.

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:55,970
Happiness is neither around us nor far away.

117
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,100
It just doesn't exist.

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,270
♫ And what I wanna say is ♫

119
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,410
♫ I only love you ♫

120
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,260
If you put it that way, I'm a little disappointed.

121
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,140
Aren't you happy to either use your friend's lap or have your friend by your side when you need him?

122
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,890
Let's be honest. Do you have a friend like me?

123
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,500
♫ I like it when you look at me from by my side ♫

124
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,430
That's right. Go ahead and sleep.

125
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,420
Sleep without dreams. Sleep tight.

126
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,610
♫ My eyes, my story ♫

127

128
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,700

World Entertainment

131
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,710
Where is Ji Hoon?

132
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,020
I don't know. How would I know where he is?

133
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm actually asking you because you're always in his room.

134
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,260
Yesterday, this is something that Ji Hoon forgot to bring from the locker room.

135
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,210
Please give it to him later.

136
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't want to.

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,770
Bro. Since you've been hanging around with Woo Seung lately,

138
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,220
I feel like your personality is getting similar to hers.

139
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,270
Oh my god.

140
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,320
Anyway, I'll leave it here.

141
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,770
Aish. I'll die because of you!

142
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,830
I can't bear the sight of you.

143
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,740
What could it be in there?

144
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,830
Aigoo.

145
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,160
ID Card
Lee Ji Hoon
Star Punch Entertainment

146
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,130
What is it?

147
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,850
It's just garbage. Why bring this?

148
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,080
Haven't they registered me as a member yet?

149
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,080
Aigoo. Let's see.

150
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,540
- Are you already going out?
- What?

151
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,420
Yes. I have somewhere to go this early in the morning.

152
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,930
This.

153
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,040
What is it?

154
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,590
It's not a big deal, but I wish you a happy birthday, Dad.

155
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,770
Ah. You didn't have to prepare this.

156
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,390
I know you don't have much money.

157
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,130
It's really nothing much.

158
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,450
Then I'll go first.

159
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,760
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon!

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,160
Pardon?

161
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,840
Are you studying well? I believe in you.

162
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,200
Yes.

163
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,470
Then, that's enough. Go.

164
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,000
Are they sneakers?

165
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,830
Yes, what is it?

166
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,290
CEO Lee, what are you doing? We are late.

167
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,820
I understand. I'm coming down.

168
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,920
CEO Lee! Hurry up!

169
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,690
At this rate, we'll be late for our appointment! Quickly! Quickly!

170
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,950
Okay. I got it, girls. Aigoo.

171
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,590
Hey! Where are you going this early?

172
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,070
The girls will be sponsored by a dermatologist with a full skincare service, so I'm taking them there.

173
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,520
Well, tonight, come home early, not late. Let's eat dinner together.

174
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
Pardon? Why?

175
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,300
Don't ask why. Do come home early, you punk. Hey, go. Just go. Go immediately.

176
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,090
See you later!

177
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,790
We will come back.

178
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,650
Part-time Job App
Albamom

179
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,390
Find the hottest part-time jobs

180
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,740
It's too far from here.

181
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,080
Something close to home.

182
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,580
Star Punch Entertainment?

183
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,910
Oh! That's right in front of the house?

184
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,590
Star Punch Entertainment is hiring an intern!

185
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,700
Hey.

186
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,390
What? You said you'd give them to Gwang Jae.

187
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,580
He didn't take them?

188
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,070
He threw a fit over these sneakers for nothing.

189
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,220
Are you talking about the new pair of sneakers?

190
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,380
Yes.

191
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,520
Those are what Ji Hoon bought as a present for Ajussi's birthday.

192
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,530
Yesterday, this is something that Ji Hoon forgot to bring from the locker room.

193
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,510
Did he take the other bag because they looked similar?

194
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,350
Hey. He's so clumsy.

195
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,080
Ji Hoon is a trainee.

196
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,500
It's a secret from his family.

197
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,890
Ah, I don't know! Why should I care about him?

198
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,050
Where could it be?

199
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,960
Aigoo.

200
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,010
Yes.

201
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,380
I'm on my way out of here after dropping the girls off.

202
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,480
And I'm near Ji Hoon's academy now.

203
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,570
I'm going to buy him a meal for lunch.

204
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,260
He has class all day. Do you think he'll have time for that?

205
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,760
If he doesn't have time, I'll buy him a lunch box.

206
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,400
Thank you for your hard work!

207
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,940
Lee Ji Hoon! Hurry up!

208
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,850
They're serving meat for today's lunch.

209
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,370
I understand. I'm coming. Just go.

210
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,080
Hurry up!

211
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,430
I'm on my way to your academy with your favorite eel lunch box.

212
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,770
What's your class number?

213
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,090
Darn it.

214
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,290
Why?

215
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,640
Why didn't he tell me he's coming?

216
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,960
Yes!

217
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,340
Where are you? I'm at the lobby.

218
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,390
I'm in class right now so I can't take long calls!

219
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,690
- What?
- I'm in class!

220
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,490
What?

221
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,700
I'm in class!

222
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,970
Ah. You're in class?

223
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,480
When will you be done?

224
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,020
Ah. It's over. That was your class bell, right?

225
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,170
Just wait in the lobby for a moment.

226
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,470
Hey, this punk. Why is he yelling like this when he said he is in class?

227
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,600
That's strange.

228
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,020
Darn it.

229
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,850
Yes, Dad. I'm at the lobby now.

230
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,370
Oh, I'm going to your classroom now.

231
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,900
It's on the third floor, right?

232
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,180
No. I'm not in my classroom right now.

233
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,100
I thought you were.

234
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,580
I told you I'm not in the classroom.

235
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,410
So, where are you?

236
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,020
I'm in the lounge with friends. It's on the eighth floor.

237
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,460
Just stay on the third floor. I'll be right there.

238
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,620
Why would you do that? I'll go up.

239
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,700
This is killing me.

240
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
What? Ji Hoon.

241
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,320
I said I'll come up here so...

242
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,470
Why are you sweating so much? Did something happen to you?

243
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,370
Well... It's not like that.

244
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,930
I had some business to take care of.

245
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,690
Business? What business?

246
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,550
Well... It's number two. A big one.

247
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,320
A big one?

248
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,010
Hey, why do you poop with such passion?

249
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,500
Anyway. Here. This is your lunch box. I bought this for you.

250
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,140
It'd be great to go out and eat together, but you're busy.

251
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,140
What? Woo Seung!

252
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,580
Do you attend this academy too?

253
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,620
What?

254
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,880
Ah, yes. Hello.

255
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,870
What happened? 
If I had known that you were here,

256
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,950
- I'd have bought another lunch box for you.
It just happened somehow.

257
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,090
No. It's fine.

258
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,280
Ajussi, I have a class now.

259
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,400
Student Ji Hoon.

260
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,430
Have you solved the problems from the printout?

261
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,800
Ah, Ji Hoon hasn't had the chance to solve them yet.

262
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,750
Ji Hoon is definitely going to solve everything today.

263
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,240
Who is it?

264
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,840
Ji Hoon's friend, Woo Seung.

265
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,830
Woo Seung?

266
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,600
Yes.

267
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,960
Yes, it's me.

268
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,580
Ji Hoon and Woo Seung, I'm going first.

269
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,060
Goodbye.

270
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,220
How long am I supposed to be here?

271
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,900
I don't think there's anyone out there.

272
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,980
Hey. This damned weather.

273
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,070
Aigoo. Why can't he take his shoes off properly?

274
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,830
Gwang Jae! Lee Gwang Jae!

275
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,350
Isn't he home yet? Gwang Jae!

276
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,230
Aigoo.

277
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,880
Grandpa!

278
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,170
Grandpa!

279
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:01,720
Yes.

280
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,250
I want some snacks.

281
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,770
Hey, why do you always eat so much?

282
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,500
Let's have a look in the refrigerator to see what you can eat!

283
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,640
Anything is fine to me. I'm hungry.

284
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,140
Okay, I got it. I understand. Let me take a look and find something to eat.

285
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,990
Ah. We have some sausages.

286
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,050
Gwang Jae?

287
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,300
- No, it's Grandpa!
- Yes.

288
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,040
Do you want to eat some sausages?

289
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,680
What? An article?

290
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,750
What are you talking about? What do you mean a training building?

291
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,340
No, what is that article about?

292
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,000
Please send me that article first so that I can read it.

293
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,020
What does he mean?

294
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,540
Star Punch Entertainment to build a dormitory for its trainees.

295
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,390
What is this?

296
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,040
Hey. Where is he going to build this training building?

297
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,960
What? This location is where our building is.

298
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,170
Hey! This jerk is really something!

299
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,690
Grandpa, you'll hurt your eyes.

300
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,180
What is it that you are staring at?

301
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,710
Mal Sook.

302
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,990
Do you think that she's preparing a birthday meal?

303
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,550
Or do you think that she's preparing a meal for a memorial ceremony?

304
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm not sure.

305
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,640
It's for a memorial ceremony, right?

306
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,880
Hey. I don't think it's for a memorial.

307
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,990
What kind of japchae do you serve for a memorial service?
(Japchae: Its glass noodles signify a long, happy, and healthy life.)

308
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,050
You're right. Japchae is made for birthday parties.

309
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,100
Exactly.

310
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,170
You're right. Japchae is...

311
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,740
No, but... Hey, look at what she took out now. Aren't they chestnuts?

312
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,780
Chestnuts?

313
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,270
Oh, you're right. Those are chestnuts.

314
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,920
It's for the memorial service, right?

315
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,690
Is that so?

316
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,550
They're chestnuts! Chestnuts mean it's for a memorial service.

317
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,000
Chestnuts are also used in braised short ribs.

318
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,630
- Braised short ribs?
- Yes.

319
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,370
I saw it. She bought ribs.

320
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:13,010
Then, does it mean it's a meal for a birthday?

321
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,970
Damn it, damn it! Holy shit!

322
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,700
Those are jujubes. She's using jujubes. Jujubes mean it's for a memorial service. It's the end for us.

323
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,350
What?

324
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,060
It's a meal for a memorial service.

325
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,290
Hey. She's probably making jakbap.
(Jakbap: A Korean snack, made with sweet rice, nuts and jujubes.)

326
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,510
Yakbap has jujubes in it.

327
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,280
Ajussi likes yakbap.

328
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,540
Yakbap? It's yakbap then.

329
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,190
If she's making jakbap, then does it mean it's for a birthday meal?

330
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,540
Aigoo. How can I figure out which one she's cooking for?

331
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,960
Is she doing this on purpose or what?

332
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,150
Bro! Where have you been?

333
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,620
Why do you look so dead tired?

334
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,170
There is a reason for that.

335
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,830
Why? What exactly happened?

336
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,930
Hey! Long time no see you!

337
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,440
You're really popular these days.

338
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,020
Wow!

339
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,710
That punk Goo Bon Wook! Look at how they're ignoring us, now that they got popular lately.

340
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,090
Why are you pretending to know them by greeting them first? Don't you have any pride?

341
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,420
- Hey.
- What?

342
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,550
Hey.

343
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,040
What is it? What is it? Why?

344
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,730
You startled us!

345
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,140
Hyung, what is it? Why?

346
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,710
Please give me an autograph. My younger sister is totally a big fan of you.

347
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,760
- An autograph?
- Yes.

348
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,000
Hey. Where?

349
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,630
Aigoo. You said it was for your younger sister.

350
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,020
To be honest, I am a big fan of you guys.

351
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,920
Aigoo.

352
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,540
Where is the CEO's office?

353
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,450
Enough, right?

354
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,110
All of us?

355
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,290
This hyung is a trainee. Let's give him an autograph.

356
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,050
Yes.

357
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,690
Are you happy now?

358
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,930
It was a permanent marker. Thank you very much.

359
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,610
So what is it? What do you not like about the song? Where? How?

360
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,020
Just I don't like it.

361
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,450
Tell me about it! Where and how?

362
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,600
There's that part there.

363
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,940
What are you saying?

364
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,300
Hey, Park Yeong Jae! Have a talk with me.

365
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,270
- Ajussi, you can't do this.
- Let me go!

366
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,510
You scared me.

367
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,590
I guess you have a guest, so I'll talk to you later.

368
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,640
Hey! Hey, this talk isn't over...

369
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,000
Hey! What does it mean you're building a trainee building?

370
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,210
What? Should I report to you about my company's business?

371
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,830
You're saying you're going to get rid of my building to make that happen!

372
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,110
Ah, I thought that your land was going to become available soon. If I like the location, I'll just do it!

373
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,500
Hey! How can you do this to us?

374
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,610
I'd like to do even worse, but this is enough. I'm restraining myself.

375
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,710
Do you think I'll give you my land that easily?!

376
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,260
Instead of talking to me about it, shouldn't you talk to the bank?

377
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,260
You really!

378
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,390
- Please leave.
- Let me go! I said to let go of me!

379
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,610
Please open the door quickly.

380
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,500
Aigoo.

381
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,490
It's stuck.

382
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,110
Please hold it in for a little while. I think I'll open it soon.

383
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,770
It's not as easy as it sounds.

384
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,270
So what kind of idiot punk got the door stuck?

385
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,130
Wait a moment.

386
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,390
I'm now about to... Oh! Please open it. Open it.

387
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,910
Grandpa, did you pee?

388
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,840

Mal Sook. It was a meal for a memorial service.

397
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:23,140
Aigoo. You cooked several dishes all day to only prepare for a memorial service,

398
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,390
even though I've been telling you not to do that?

399
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:31,700
For twenty years, Gwang Jae has been by your side taking good care of you through hard times.

400
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,260
Is it that hard to celebrate Gwang Jae's birthday this time?

401
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,700
I want to hold a memorial service for that person.

402
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,260
So, why are you holding his memorial service?

403
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,540
It's been 20 years already.

404
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,730
Hyeon Jae doesn't have any family members left who would do this for him.

405
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,910
I'm going to forget him now.

406
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,180
That's right. You did well.

407
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,100
But...

408
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:05,790
What bothers me is that I've never held a memorial service for him before

409
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,430
because I wanted to believe that he was still alive.

410
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:18,460
As of today, I'll consider him dead in my heart.

411
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,430
Due to long-term unpaid bills, your property will be seized.

412
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,080
Hey! What smells so delicious that I can feel it from outside?

413
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,460
What day is it?

414
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,160
You idiot.

415
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,650
It's your birthday!

416
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,100
What?

417
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,840
It's a memorial service.

418
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,630
Before your birthday, let's pay our respects and say goodbye to Hyeon Jae.

419
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,250
After the memorial service, I'll set your birthday meal.

420
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,580
Oh, Ji Hoon. You too go get changed into a suit and come out.

421
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,700
Gwang Jae, lend him a suit.

422
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,100
Ah, this is killing me.

423
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,550
Ji Hoon, pour him a drink.

424
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,740
Pardon?

425
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,620
Yes.

426
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,140
I've had a lot of resentment towards you, but let's forget everything.

427
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:02,710
I'll forget you so you also have to forget me, you punk!

428
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,770
Right. Also, we don't have to be so formal.

429
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,860
Let's all bow and get this done.

430
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,060
Go ahead and bow to him.

431
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,020
Hyeon Jae, goodbye.

Hey! No, it's not like that.

461
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,770
It is! It definitely looks like that! You made it obvious.
