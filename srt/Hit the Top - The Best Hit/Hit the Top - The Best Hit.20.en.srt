00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,570
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,350
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,490
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,670
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,100
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,850
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,800
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,630
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,060
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,340
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,800
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,750
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,970
Is Old Student doing well?

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,060
Ah. Because he doesn't talk too much,

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,450
shouldn't he be feeling upset and sad now?

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,980
He missed another chance at the debut team.

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,640
I don't know how he is, but he must be feeling too upset and sad.

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,030
I'd like to visit him once at least.

19
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,310
He doesn't even read my messages.

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,520
Next. Next time. I don't think this is the right time.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,670
- So funny. Who are you to decide that?
- What?

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,950
No, what I meant was... So...

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,240
Anyway, when you think it's a good time to see him,

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,890
let me meet him at least once.

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,430
Okay?

26
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,720
Okay. No problem.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,400
But, is she acting like my boss or my noona?

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,200
Ah, this is unbelievable.

29
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,300
Why did I answer her again? What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,300
Yes, yes. Is it tomorrow?

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm in my right mind these days.

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,290
I won't be there late. See you tomorrow.

33
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,320
Ah, right. Also, what about fasting and...

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,730
Look at that jerk!

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,350
Yes. You said it was a check-up again.

36
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,060
Yes. Yes, I understand.

37
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,040
Yes, see you tomorrow.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,800
What are you doing, Mal Sook?

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,710
Push harder. This is no fun.

40
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,610
I'm already doing my best.

41
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,800
- Push harder.
- I got it.

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,640
Ah, that little jerk seriously...

43
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,980
No, Grandpa.

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,250
What was that?

45
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,480
Go.

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,380
You're asking me to go?

47
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,270
Go, just go.

48
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,620
What's with that kid?

49
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,530
Okay, I got it.

50
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,550
What are you doing? I told you to push harder!

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,770
Okay, I got it. Oppa.

52
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,720
Didn't you have breakfast?

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,130
Jeong Hwa used to push me a lot harder.

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,510
I'll push you even harder.

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,270
Ah, that rude little jerk is really mean.

56
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,110
Harder.

57
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,500
Yes, I already called and checked with the bank.

58
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,260
It's said that they will go into foreclosure procedures no later than tomorrow.

59
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,450
So their building is definitely ours now, right?

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,140
It's almost like that.

61
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,930
But don't let your guard down and keep an eye on it until the end.

62
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,660
Allowing rice to sit off the heat is the most important step.

63
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,640
Rice? I haven't had any rice.

64
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,610
That was an analogy. I was making an analogy.

65
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,530
And since I'm exercising, don't set up any meetings.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,740
The architecture firm will be here for a while.

67
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,220
Mal Sook!

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,210
You.

69
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,060
- What were you doing at the playground earlier?
- What?

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,430
Why were you pushing his swing even on a hot day like this?

71
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,930
Because he wanted to ride the swing.

72
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,180
This is the way it's supposed to be. A girl should ride the swing and a boy should push it.

73
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,560
You aren't Chun Hyang and Hyang Dan (characters in a well-known Korean legend).

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,380
Who is Hyang Dan?

75
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,300
- Don't you know the story of Chun Hyang?!
- Chun Hyang?

76
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,570
I want to eat green onion pancakes.

77
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,610
Anyway, your roles have been completely switched.

78
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,690
What the hell do you like about that little jerk?

79
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,960
When I meet him next time, I'll have a serious talk to him and fix this mess.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,900
How dare that little jerk make a girl push a swing.

81
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,840
Grandpa, there are not fixed roles for boys and girls.

82
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,100
So you should ride on the swing. Why are you pushing his swing instead, you kid?

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,660
Why is that important?

84
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,830
- Grandpa, you don't know anything!
- What?

85
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,370
I'll take care of it myself so Grandpa don't butt in.

86
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,300
Please!

87
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,920
What?

88
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,210
I look great even with my hair down.

89
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,550
What? Why is this here?

90
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,390
Star Punch Entertainment

91
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,360
I'm here to meet the CEO.

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,100
The CEO? Did you make an appointment?

93
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,810
No, I didn't make an appointment. If you tell him I'm here, he'll see me.

94
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,040
Pardon?

95
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,820
I see. Who should I tell him you are? What is your name?

96
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,590
Since it's a corner house, rather than making it stand out from its surroundings,

97
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,130
it would be better to use zinc for the exterior, and on this side, we'd be using exposed concrete for the walls.

98
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,200
Zinc?

99
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,330
That sounds good but I want it to be sophisticated.

100
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,390
Something that gives a feeling of looking glamorous but not too imposing.

101
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,110
Glamorous? Ah, yes.

102
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,530
What is he saying?

103
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,760
CEO, you have a guest.

104
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,470
You know I'm in the middle of a meeting.

105
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,040
But, he said he must see you.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,730
Who is it?

107
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,880
It's just that he said his name is Yoo Hyeon Jae.

108
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,130
Yoo Hyeon Jae?

109
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,700
What?

110
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,850
Park Yeong Jae.

111
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,290
No. You...

112
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,510
Long time, no see.

113
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,750
How... How can you...?

114
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,410
So, you're really Yoo Hyeon Jae?

115
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,050
I've been telling you that so far. Why? You don't think it's me.

116
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,050
It doesn't make sense that you're Yoo Hyeon Jae.

117
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,440
Aigoo.

118
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,010
What?

119
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,980
Then, back then you also...

120
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,550
How are you going to prove that you are Yoo Hyeon Jae?

121
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,080
There's nothing to prove objectively.

122
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,800
But... You, of all people, should know that I am me.

123
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,850
Or else, should I tell you something that only we know?

124
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,260
No, no. This makes no sense.

125
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,830
How can you not get old at all? You look exactly as you did back then.

126
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,380
Ah. That's a long story. A matter of circumstances.

127
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,280
Anyway, it also took Gwang Jae a while to believe me.

128
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,350
Does Gwang Jae also know this?

129
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,940
I'm not here to talk about that.

130
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,980
In the meantime, you've been making money using my composition notebook.

131
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,370
- What?
- You have my notebook, right?

132
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,470
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,100
- What notebook?
- I know everything.

134
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,440
You've released my composed songs from my notebook through MJ.

135
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,270
What?

136
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,350
You don't have to be so scared. I'm not asking you to give them all back to me.

137
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,380
Instead, I do need some money now.

138
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,400
In fact, that's why I decided to appear in front of you.

139
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,680
What?

140
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,770
Right. I also want my workspace,

141
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,330
because I think I need to work on some music.

142
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,100
I hope you give me a proper and suitable position for me to work.

143
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,890
That kind of request, you can do it for me.

144
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,090
Right. Wouldn't it be better to not tell people that I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae, right?

145
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,090
So that's why I made up a new name. It's Thumbs Up.

146
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,000
No. It's Da Bong.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,510
Kim Da Bong. "Da" means The Greatest, and "Bong" means Phoenix.

148
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,520
I see you're busy.

149
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,920
You better start talking about business quickly.

150
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,850
I have to go to my Taekwondo academy. I'm a blue belt.

151
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,840
You're only a blue belt?

152
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,650
I'm a black belt.

153
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,010
A black belt, you punk.

154
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,080
Did you just call me to show off that?

155
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,810
What a rude jerk.

156
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,040
♫  I’m afraid we’ll grow apart ♫

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,560
Here. This.

158
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,170
What's this?

159
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:18,970
That'll buy everything you want at the toy store for the time being.

160
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,130
What?

161
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,270
Break up with Mal Sook.

162
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,300
With Mal Sook?

163
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,720
That's the condition.

164
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,700
We've raised Mal Sook without a mother.

165
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,700
I can't give her to a guy like you.

166
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,560
Take that and break up with Mal Sook.

167
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,220
I'll tell Mal Sook myself.

168
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,810
You!

169
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,180
Be sure to do it right, you punk.

170
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,260
I succeded.

171
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,050
But, why hasn't Mal Sook's mom ever come to visit her?

172
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,660
Ah. You don't seem to know about Mal Sook's story at all.

173
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,720
That is not a good story.

174
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,120
Aigoo. Still, we need to know why.

175
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,930
Mal Sook's mom was Chairman's only daughter.

176
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,040
Because Chairman had her late in his life, and since she was her only daughter, he adored her.

177
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,060
Manager, please tell us the story.

178
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,730
But, his only daughter fell in love with a jerk who worked for Chairman.

179
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,560
Of course, Chairman went crazy over the matter.

180
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,690
The two of them ran away to the countryside and lived together well for a few years.

181
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,110
But how could she pretend not to know her only father?

182
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,970
Oppa?

183
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,880
She kept coming up to Seoul to beg his father for permission.

184
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,470
And soon after Mal Sook was born, they got into a car accident on their way home.

185
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,470
I'm very sorry to hear that.

186
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,920
In the end, Chairman Lee and his daughter couldn't make up.

187
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,460
Mal Sook's mom passed away and she went to heaven first.

188
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,140
And that's how Chairman ended up bringing Mal Sook here to raise her.

189
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,050
Yes, hello?

190
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,980
Yes, Yoo Dae Ri. Wait a moment, please.

191
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,690
Pardon?

192
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,100
No... What do you mean? I don't understand.

193
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,100
As of today, all your debt has been paid off.

194
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,440
I thought you knew about it.

195
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,970
Who made the deposit?

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Wait a moment. It says Park Yeong Jae.

197
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,640
Pardon?

198
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,510
Yes, I understand.

199
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,170
So he signed a contract with Bo Hee.

200
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,050
Hey. This is really thumbs up!

201
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,650
It might take me a while to learn how to use this properly.

202
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,060
I'm going to introduce you to the company staff as a general producer.

203
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,110
The money, you talked about earlier, was deposited in the bank.

204
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,810
Thanks anyway.

205
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,690
You're welcome. Let me know if there is anything else you need.

206
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,730
Okay, I got it. I'll not refuse your offer so I'll keep asking you if I need anything else.

207
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,310
Aigoo, Yoo Hyeon Jae!

208
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,210
Excuse me, CEO.

209
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,860
Did you find out what I asked you?

210
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,230
It's under investigation now, I'm working on it.

211
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,050
Who is that guy who just got in our company now?

212
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,480
No matter what it takes or what you do, you'll have to find out what his identity is first.

213
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,550
Yes, I understand.

214
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,190
Also, the chairman is now waiting for you in the department store in front of the company.

215
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,630
I don't feel like going there now. Let her know that.

216
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,020
Chairman said she'd wait there until three o'clock and that she'd hit you for every minute you're late.

217
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,280
Ah, seriously.

218
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,840
Hey.

219
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,510
What are you doing?

220
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,890
Hey, it's a nuisance to exercise in a small place like this.

221
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,210
Who is a nuisance?

222
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,110
What?

223
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,800
Ah, I wasn't really going to reveal this, but

224
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,100
yesterday, Ji Hoon received another chance to join the debut team.

225
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,500
- And?
- And...

226
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,280
But suddenly he ran out in the middle of his interview.

227
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,610
Because of someone.

228
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,150
What? Because of who?

229
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,740
Who is the one who says "because of who"? It's someone who just asked me the same question!

230
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,120
Me?

231
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,820
He went there right after he heard you got injured in the mountains. You didn't meet him?

232
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,510
We didn't.

233
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,720
Give me that. Anyway...

234
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,510
Hey.

235
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,230
What? Isn't it water?

236
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,020
I thought it was water.

237
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,600
It's mouthwash.

238
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,100
It turned out well! I see you don't brush your teeth very often.

239
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,970
Just gargle with this.

240
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,970
What's wrong with her?

241
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,010
Hey, friend!

242
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,100
These days, you're often on it.

243
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,390
I didn't know at first but I think it's kind of addictive to be resting here.

244
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,700
If you lie down like this, you can see the night sky so well.

245
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,460
Let's go in.

246
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,100
Did you come yesterday?

247
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,300
What?

248
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,100
I heard you came to pick me up.

249
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,600
Ah, well... We must have just missed each other.

250
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,300
You weren't there when I arrived.

251
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,420
Thank you.

252
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,050
Don't mention it.

253
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,940
I heard you got another chance to join the debut team yesterday.

254
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,970
- But because of me—
- They'll call me back if they need me.

255
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,300
Lee Ji Hoon!

256
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,890
Can't we just be friends?

257
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,270
Like the old days, let's just be comfortable friends.

258
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,340
Do you really see me as a woman?

259
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,180
I mean you know. We've been friends for a long time.

260
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,430
Can you have something like a kiss with me?

261
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,770
When we were young, we even bathed togethe—

262
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:57,140
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

263
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,090
♫  Only to you, I can give my all ♫

264
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:07,060
♫ Remember my love, my eyes, my story ♫

265
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,110
I can do it.

266
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,380
I can't go back to being friends with you now.

267
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,690
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,110
♫ Yes, fool, I have a lot to say to you too ♫

269
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,510
♫  All day, I wrote down funny things that happened ♫

270
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,880
♫  I’ll tell you all of it as I slowly fall asleep ♫

271
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,510
♫  I’ll tell you stories cozy like the clouds ♫

272
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,580
♫  At night, it’s too dark but ♫

273
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,890
♫  I’ll be your roof, don’t worry ♫

274
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,610
♫  You don’t have to say anything ♫

275
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,150
Mal Sook, you little brat.

276
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,890
Stop crying.

277
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,510
It's not like our country is in ruins.

278
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,350
Is your grandfather dead?

279
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,220
What are you so sad about?

280
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,810
I don't know.

281
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,220
Oppa Sin Hwa doesn't want to play with me anymore.

282
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,100
He is a rude little punk. That's great.

283
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,350
Mal Sook. Mal Sook, shall I go buy some ice cream?

284
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,870
I don't want it.

285
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,930
Aish! This kiddo seriously!

286
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,800
♫  My hope, it’s all you ♫

287
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,790

288
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,230
♫ I like it when you look at me from by my side ♫

289
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,680
♫  i like it when you lean on my shoulder ♫

290
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,500
Hey! But that little punk.

291
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,430
♫  My love, my eyes, my story ♫

292
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,140
♫  My hope, it’s all you ♫

293
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,520
♫  And what I wanna say is ♫

294
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,450
♫  I only love you ♫

295
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,850
♫ Oh, oh, oh ♫

296
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,540
♫ Oh, oh, oh. Yeah! ♫

297
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,170
♫ Oh, oh, oh ♫

298
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,410
♫ Oh, oh, oh. Yeah! ♫

299
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,910
♫ Listening to you as you’re in my arms ♫

300
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,860
♫  Having you in my arms ♫

301
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,350
What's wrong with her?

302
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,300
I did something, so I deserve to get hit.

303
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,720
- What did you do to deserve that?
- Forget it.

304
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,470
Still, I have no regrets.

305
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,190
Where is a vending machine?

306
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,080
What would you like?

307
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,590
Wait a moment.

308
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,920
A scoop of chocolate and strawberry...

309
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,600
And a scoop of chirping cherries whatever, whatever.

310
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,330
- Can you wrap them for me?
- Yes.

311
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,350
What ridiculous names for ice cream are like these ones?

312
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,480
Tell me what you want to eat. I'll buy you everything you want.

313
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,170
- Really?
- Of course.

314
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,090
I got pocket money a while ago.

315
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,510
Oppa. I like your abilities.

316
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,850
- It's delicious, right?
- Yes.

317
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,550
Give it back!

318
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,110
- Give it back to me!
- You want this one, little punk?

319
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,180
It serves you right, you little punk!

320
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,040
- What's wrong?
- That elder took my ice cream.

321
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,160
That elder did that?

322
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,890
Excuse me, elder.

323
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Are you filming a music video today?

324
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,160
Yes, we'll have to film for an hour or two in the lobby.

325
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,280
What a hassle. You just should have finished it at the studio.

326
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,950
The director needs an outdoor lobby scene.

327
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,490
- Anyway... After it's done, wrap it up and send them away.
- Yes.

328
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,030
Ah, you scared me!

329
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,330
What are you doing here?

330
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,140
What? Right. I'm studying this program...

331
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,750
This room is the most comfortable and spacious in this company.

332
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,410
Let's share this room. Can you do that, right?

333
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,400
No matter what you say, it's still my room.

334
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,200
I know this is room. That's why I'm here.

335
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,700
Okay. Okay then. I can go out, right?

336
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,410
I'll get out. I'm going out.

337
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,800
Is there anything particularly uncomfortable in your body?

338
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,650
Yes. Well... You know, from some point on...

339
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,850
- You know, that thing...
- What thing?

340
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,840
Hey, why can't I remember again?

341
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,230
No, what I mean... This thing.

342
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,030
- Your head?
- Ah, yes. My head.

343
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,090
My head has been hurting a bit, it seems like a migraine.

344
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,950
Since when have you been forgetting words?

345
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:56,680
Words? Ah! That's because I'm quite old.

346
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,940
Why don't you get one last check-up while you're here?

347
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,920
What else should I do?

348
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,260
Please be quiet!

349
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,100
If we're ready, let's roll.

350
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,860
- Ready?
- Camera roll!

351
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,390
Cue!

- Thank you for your hard work!

Go and check quickly on her! Eun Byeol!

Are you okay? Are you hurt?

368
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,690
I just fell down.

369
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,810
I got a scratch.

370
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,010
Did you get a scratch?

371
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,390
She can't get a scratch. What are we supposed to do now?

372
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,860
What is this?

373
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,760
Who did this?!

374
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,730
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,590
- Who are you?
- Pardon?

376
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,430
Well, I'm an intern here.

377
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,200
Didn't you know we were filming? What are you doing here?!

378
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,300
If you are an intern, you should get your act together and stay focused!

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,700
He's the new general producer.

385
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,120
Ah, nice to meet you. I'm director Jo Chan Joo...

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,240
You were filming in a public area. Isn't it the basic that the cords should be arranged while filming?

392
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,310
Our staff member got hurt because of this. Who's going to take responsibility for this?

- Yes, I work here.

403
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,840
Then, did you get your memory back?

404
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,770

We'll have to do more tests, but you're in the early stage of Alzheimer's.

415
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,800
In some cases, you won't remember much from now on.

416
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,730
You must practice what you have to remember. Okay?
