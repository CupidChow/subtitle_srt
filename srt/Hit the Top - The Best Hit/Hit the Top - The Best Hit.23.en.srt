00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,490
Why are you sleeping like this? 
♫  I didn’t know love  ♫

15
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,910
Ah. 
♫  I guess I’m still too young  ♫

16
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,520
♫  Whenever I looked at you  ♫

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,750
How are you feeling?

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,060
Are you okay? 
♫  My heart fluttered for some reason  ♫

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,370
Well, I'm better after sleeping for a bit. 
♫  Your clear eyes  ♫

20
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,060
Your face is still red, though. 
♫  They were so kind  ♫

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,510
That's because I have a fever.

22
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,380
♫  I couldn’t fall asleep  ♫

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,150
Lay down for a bit more. I'll make some porridge.

24
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,960
♫  I could only think about you  ♫

♫  If you come to me  ♫

27
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,520
I don't even know how to cook porridge.

28

♫  I’ll feel like I have the world  ♫

♫  I’m shouting to the sky  ♫

30
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,680
He should be able to eat it, right?

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,670
♫  It’s only you  ♫

32

36
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,430
♫  Are you listening?  ♫

37
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,670
You're hungry, aren't you? It's almost done.

38
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,060
Do you like porridge, by the way?
♫  To me?  ♫

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,740
My nickname was Porridge Lover. I love porridge so much.

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,030
Eat a lot, even if you don't have an appetite. You have to eat a lot to get over a cold.

41
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,120
- That is, you eat it first.
- What?

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,100
It's not that I'm being suspicious. I finally got better, what if I get sicker after eating this?

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,410
Seeing you being like this, you're all better. Eat, quick.

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,960
It's bland.

45
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,730
Bland?

46
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,700
Kimchi.

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,500
You want kimchi?

48
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,440
Water!

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,990
Water?

50
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,370
Let's get water on our own, okay?

51
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,330
But I'm sick ...

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,950
Sure, you're right. You're sick.

53
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,610
Since you're sick.

54
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,720
Kimchi.

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,380
It's too big.

56
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,540
That's right.

57
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,320
Eating it like this, it tastes alright.

58
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,830
- It's okay?
- It's good.

59
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,510
Really?

60
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,790
It was even raining yesterday. Why did you come? You didn't even know when I'd come out.

61
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,570
At least you should have sent me a message saying you came.

62
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,520
- You said you were doing your overdue revisions all at once!
- What?

63
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,690
Anyway, you want to say thank you? What for, there's no need.

64
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,990
Th-Thank you, who wants to say thank you?

65
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,890
Ah, why do I suddenly feel like eating fried eggs?

66
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,180
Fried eggs?

67
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,310
Just eat. When will—

68
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,650
But I'm sick?

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,600
Wait a bit.

70
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,500
It's good.

71
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
The Best Hit

72
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,110
World Entertainment

73
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,190
Ji Hoon, take that up for me. I think I have to go out.

74
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,200
Right away? But you must be tired.

75
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,260
I'm fine, I slept a bit yesterday.

76
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,560
It looks like they want to use Helter-Skelter regularly.

77
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,470
If that goes well, we won't have to go around doing events here and there anymore.

78
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,400
If you're going to Dongdaemun, can you drop me off?

79
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,470
Why, do you have something to buy?

80
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,740
No, I have a broken watch and wanted to have it checked somewhere there.

81
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,990
Sure, then get ready and come down.

82
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,720
Right. You can't forget the promise you made yesterday, okay?

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,800
I still haven't promised anything yet. I said I would think about it.

84
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,630
Anyway.

85
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,050
You're here?

86
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,070
What's this? You slept out here?

87
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:54,100
Oh... The room's door is broken so it doesn't open.

88
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,450
Oh, you're here? I heard you went fishing. Did you catch any fish?

89
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,890
Then yesterday, it was only you two? What about Drill?

90
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,140
Drill said he had to go home for a bit.

91
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,560
What if it's only us two?

92
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,650
World Entertainment

93
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,130
Why does it have to break now of all times?

94
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,800
And Drill, that buffoon, he should tell me in advance if he's going home!

95
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,840
Hey. I told you not to touch other people's stuff.

96
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,810
What are you talking about, other people's stuff?

97
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,900
It's my watch, you know very well.

98
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,620
What the! How is it yours? It's mine!

99
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,330
But I was told for sure that it was my late father's watch, unique in the world.

100
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,060
- What are you doing?
- What?

101
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,830
Didn't you say you were going out?

102
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,430
I will.

103
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,430
But it looks like this watch is broken.

104
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,610
It's just something like a symbol of my good fortune.

105
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,960
Lee Ji Hoon. Let's have a talk.

106
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,290
What?

107
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,290
I don't know how I should tell you this.

108
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,460
But rather than beating around the bush, saying it directly is probably better.

109
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,760
What is it?

110
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,040
Somehow, I lied to you a bit.

111
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,500
- What lie?
- I thought it wasn't it,

112
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,850
but it wasn't, not it.

113
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,800
So what is it?

114
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,410
I ...

115
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,430
I think I like Choi Woo Seung.

116
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,130
No. I like her.

117
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,900
I knew it.

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,990
What?

119
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,230
I knew it.

120
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,000
How could you know something I didn't even know myself?

121
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,380
There isn't anything wrong these days, is there?

122
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,540
Natural Deer Antlers

123
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,830
Is it deer antlers? What would be wrong?

124
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:23,190
No, but these few days you've been very feeble and you don't eat.

125
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,270
It's summer for an old man, I must be short on energy.

126
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,290
Since when did you feel weak in summer?

127
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,610
By the way, World Entertainment, you know ...

128
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,100
I'm thinking about putting it back to work.

129
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,820
What do you mean?

130
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,910
To properly get the agency running, like the old times.

131
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,990
Isn't it looking for trouble?

132
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,910
If I just get some investors, I think I could do like before.

133
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,820
I heard that an enormous amount of money goes into getting even just one song, these days.

134
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,710
Just to make one idol, it costs at the very least two billion won  (≈ $1.7 million).

135
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,020
Do you think we can handle it?

136
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,650
Well, for getting a song, I have somewhere in mind.

137
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,160
But we need to get investments.

138
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,000
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

139

Don't you have anything to do?

141

I don't. Why are you here doing this?

142
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,310
There's nowhere in the office where I can spread this all out to work.

143
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,660
♫  I only love you ♫

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,670
You ... You don't know that, do you?

149
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,650
What?

150
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,660
You won the lottery.

151
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,690
What lottery? I didn't buy any coupon, though?

152
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,780

Stop playing around and go. I have to finish this quick.

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,320
♫ I blink and capture the moment in my heart ♫

160
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,710
♫ I like it when you look at me from by my side ♫

161
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,700
♫  i like it when you lean on my shoulder ♫

162
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,630
I don't remember anything at all.

163
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,660
You were born in 1971.

164
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,910
Sorry? Seventy- Seventy-one?

165
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,940
But why do you keep speaking informally?

166
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,410
What?

167
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,890
Hey, with your father, I—

168
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,040
With my father? What?

169
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,980
♫  Our eyes, our memories, our hopes ♫

170
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,360
♫  I’ll remember it all ♫

171
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,390
♫  Tonight ♫

172
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,170
You're only coming now?

173
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,070
Hey Bro.

174
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,940
I'm so tired.

175
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,510
You said you went home. What was so tiring?

176
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,750
What?

177
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,970
Aah, there were a few things happening.

178
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,530
- I heard it rained a lot in Seoul yesterday.
- Did it?

179
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,370
What's this? You weren't here yesterday either?

180
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,310
Yeah, I went night fishing yesterday.

181
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,250
Oh, you did?

182
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,110
Then! In the room— Oh my!

183
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,470
Thumbs Up and Choi Woo Seung! Oh my, oh my!

184
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,110
It was only these two?

185
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,460
This is crazy!

186
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,300
What crazy?

187
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,670
- It doesn't seem like Kim Da Bong is Yoo Hyeon Jae.
- Really?

188
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,960
I took Da Bong's fingerprints without him knowing and checked,

189
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,170
but it came out as Yoo Bong Jae, born in 1971.

190
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,600
Yoo Bong Jae is Yoo Hyeon Jae.

191
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,220
Pardon?

192
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,010
There aren't many people who know this.

193
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,800
You're sure about the fingerprints, right?

194
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,790
I gave a lot of money for the commission.

195
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,910
Anyway, you did well. You can go.

196
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,390
Yes.

197
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,060
I knew it, but it means that it really is Yoo Hyeon Jae.

198
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,250
The Yoo Hyeon Jae who disappeared twenty years ago suddenly reappeared?

199
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,420
But how did he not age at all?

200
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,390
This goblin-like guy.

201
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,850
You haven't had lunch, right? Eat this.

202
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,810
How can you come all the way here?

203
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,410
I haven't had sushi in so long.

204
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,120
It tastes good, doesn't it?

205
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,070
I used to be a regular there twenty years ago, but I went again and they're still there!

206
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,940
The owner aged quite a lot.

207
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,240
He was such a handsome man when he was younger.

208
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,300
His hair is all gone.

209
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,680
Really, you're telling lies at the drop of a hat.

210
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,210
What lies?

211
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,290
If you were a regular there twenty years ago, then were you eating sushi as a toddler?

212
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,090
Well no, it's just a way of saying!

213
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,370
Anyway, I'm feeling uneasy eating this.

214
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,860
Uneasy? Why?

215
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,780
It's weird! Why are you suddenly being nice to me?

216
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,170
Because I want to.

217
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,830
That's what I'm saying, why do you?

218
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,900
I must like you, I guess.

219
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,370
What?

220
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,930
Why do you have so many questions, when you have this excellent lunch in front of you?

221
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,920
This is tuna, it's amazing. Try it.

222
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,500
When you eat it, it melts in your mouth.

223
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,840
♫ Beautiful ♫

224
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,210
Are you coming back from somewhere?

225
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,260
Yeah, I bought some books.

226
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,070
I put Mal Sook's snack in the fridge. You can just eat it up when she comes.

227
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,290
Okay. Are you going to the shop?

228
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,360
- Yes.
- Okay.

229
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:34,620
Okay, if I read this, I'll be able to overcome it as I want.
How to Win the Battle Against Dementia

230
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,700
Let's see.

231
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:49,580
Just reading the title, I feel like I've won half of the battle against dementia.

232
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,470
President. It's quite difficult to see you.

233
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,930
Well, are we in a relationship where we get happy seeing each other?

234
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,760
It's better to not have anything to see each other over.

235
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,950
Is that so?

236
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:14,930
For this album, I'd like to start all over again from the beginning.

237
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,270
What are you saying? We got the concept and everything.

238
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,990
I did everything you told me until now.

239
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,580
- But I plan on not doing so now.
- What?

240
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm saying I'll stop deceiving people.

241
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,730
And I'll apologize for deceiving them all this time, too.

242
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,700
Are you drunk?

243
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,870
I didn't drink, though.

244
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,030
You aren't even drunk, but you say this kind of thing?

245
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,790
The moment this goes out, you'll be the first to be done for.

246
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,740
Everything you have will go up in smoke.

247
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,290
I never thought it was mine, though.

248
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,870
Why are you like this? You too? I already have a bad headache as it is.

249
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,300
Oppa. Let's talk.

250
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,590
MJ, good morning.

251
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,730
Chairman too, good morning as well.

252
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,070
Why haven't you taken care of Bo Hee yet? I told you she absolutely won't do, didn't I?

253
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,590
What are you saying, changing things now? I have a reputation to keep.

254
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,900
A reputation?

255
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,130
Oppa. Are you drunk?

256
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,750
I didn't drink, though.

257
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,050
You aren't even drunk, but you say this kind of thing?

258
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,750
Well, I've said all I had to so I'll be going now.

259
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,760
Hey, you only said what you wanted!

260
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,350
Let me ask one thing. Why are you suddenly like this?

261
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,500
It's not suddenly, I've been thinking about it all the time.

262
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,830
Someone said this: for a puzzle that's been put wrong,

263
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,720
the only thing you can do is knock it apart entirely.

264
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,330
A puzzle?

265
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,850
Here.

266
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,400
Hey Part-time Oppa!

267
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,510
What is it again?

268
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,900
Choose a cake for me.

269
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,950
A cake? Is it your birthday?

270
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,450
It's not my birthday, but I have something to celebrate.

271
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,280
Here.

272
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,130
It's pretty.

273
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,620
What are you doing?

274
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,180
It's for you to congratulate me.

275
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,440
I wanted to get congratulated by you.

276
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,290
The debut date for my group has been decided.

277
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,870
Really? That's great!

278
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,490
I'll blow the candle, so please clap for me.

279
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,040
Okay.

280
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,420
Congratulations, really. So, for when has it been decided?

281
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,280
September 9th.

282
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,900
But why aren't you going to Ssen?

283
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,670
I heard you were selected for the debut group, but you said you won't do it.

284
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,070
That is... My father is a manager as well.

285
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,330
And he's the president of an entertainment company, even though it's a small one.

286
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,090
Really? Where?

287
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,700
- Here.
- What?

288
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,240
It's called World Enertainment, and it's in this building.

289
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,600
I'll debut there.

290
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,490
Hello. PR asked me to bring this.

291
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,670
Leave it there.

292
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:16,200
If you look at the back, there is a hard drive with some documents I put in, the black one with a star shape on it. Bring it to me.

293
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,760
Yes.

294
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,680
What did you say you brought from PR?

295
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,740
It looked like material for MJ, would you like to take a look?

296
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,780
Yeah, bring it.

297
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,130
- It's good, I think?
- Yep.

298
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,650
What's this? Why is it like this?

299
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,520
- Ah really, I'm going crazy!
- Pardon?

300
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,950
It looks like everything we worked on disappeared.

301
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,350
What? Then what do we do! What about the backup you were doing?

302
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,610
I was going to do the backup, but—

303
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,380
Hey intern. How are you going to take responsibility? Uh?

304
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,680
Because of you, it all went up in smoke!

305
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,950
Ah, I—

306
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,440
Why is it her fault?

307
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,370
Isn't it basic to do a backup as you work?

308
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,420
I worked on this all night, really.

309
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,270
This is for this afternoon, right away.

310
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,220
Then it's fine if I remake it, right?

311
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,430
Pardon? How will you do this?

312
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,680
I heard it once earlier. I kind of remember.

313
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,110
Pardon? Then, I will send you the guide—

314
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,230
No need. I heard it once, and I remember, I tell you.

315
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,880
I don't care. He can do as he sees fit.

316
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,740
Follow me. Let's go.

317
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,570
Really, I'm going crazy, dammit.

318
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,010
Hey, Thumbs Up, can you make the MIDI?

319
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,000
I kind of remember.

320
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,970
It can't be here.

321
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,950
Is there a ghost playing games? Really.

322
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,540
Grandfather, what are you doing?

323
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,850
The book I was reading disappeared.

324
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,870
Book?

325
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,310
Yes. The book I was reading just earlier.

326
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,430
Where did I put it? Where did it go?

327
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,740
Ah really, it's not like the book got legs, where did it go?

328
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,680
That's not it. I shouldn't be just searching like this.

329
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,480
I should focus my mind.

330
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,530
Where there is a will, there is a way, they say.

331
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:18,400
Lee Soon Tae!  Where did you read the book?

332
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,470
Where did you go, taking the book?

333
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,340
Let's focus your mind, your mind.

334
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,530
I don't know! I don't know, I don't know!

335
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,700
Where did it go really? Aigoo.

336
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,600
Where did I leave it? Ah, this is annoying.

337
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,830
No! If I can't find the book here,

338
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,160
then I am suffering a complete defeat against dementia!

339
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,290
Lee Soon Tae! You have to find it no matter what.

340
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,590
No matter what.

341
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,060
Thumbs Up. I'm seeing you in a completely new light.

342
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,720
What's with this look?

343
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,210
It's not seeing in a new light, it's a look like you've completely fallen for me, though?

344
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,650
O-Okay. Well, today I'll accept every act of narcissism.

345
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,110
But I really lived thanks to you.

346
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,040
Narcissism? Is it like attraction, something like this?

347
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,750
Well, it's something similar.

348
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,350
But how can you make it again after hearing it only once, like this?

349
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,820
Even if I tell you, you won't understand.

350
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,400
What?

351
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,340
If you ask someone who draws well, "How do you draw so well?" what can they answer?

352
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,870
It's vague and difficult to explain with words.

353
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,590
- Is it?
- See!

354
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,360
I told you I don't tell lies.

355
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,760
Did I or did I not tell you that I was quite excellent?

356
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,070
Look at that. I knew that you were excellent there, so tone it down a bit, okay?

357
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,810
Even when I think about it, I am indeed quite awestruck.

358
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,400
Awestruck? Why?

359
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,670
You know, how come even my ears are excellent?

360
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:17,460
Honestly, what isn't excellent on this head?

361
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,130
These eyes that hold charisma and cuteness.

362
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,670
This sharp nose.

363
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,120
my lips, well, they are totally excellent,

364
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,570
but I don't have a way to describe them.

365
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,550
You, you! If only you could do something about these lips, it'll be totally excellent!

366
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,990
It looks like it's improved since the first time? Did you make it?

367
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,990
Well, it was the new general producer.

368
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,040
The new general producer?

369
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,130
Hyeon J— I mean, Thumbs Up?

370
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,770
Yes. At first, I disregarded him because he was here through connections, but he is quite impressive.

371
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,000
He picked up what we deleted by accident after only hearing it once.

372
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,340
From mixing to subtly arranging.

373
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,530
I thought he was out of date, but I guess a diamond on a dunghill is a precious diamond still.

374
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,610
But who is he, really? I've never seen him before.

375
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,500
And the name Thumbs Up is a first, too.

376
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,770
If it's like this, it changes things.

377
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,990
That means there are still some parts to make use of.

378
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,020
Hey, Choi Woo Seung.

379
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,190
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon.

380
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,030
Here you go.

381
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,370
Hey, what's all this?

382
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,960
You must get hungry studying at night. Eat this then.

383
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,470
Perks of a friend who works in a bakery.

384
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,960
Thumbs up!

385
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,330
You're becoming similar to Thumbs Up, sticking with him all the time.

386
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,730
Come on, what are you saying?

387
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,520
Is work doable?

388
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,730
Don't ask me. I don't know why I only keep causing trouble.

389
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,820
Is it hard?

390
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,430
Today too, if it weren't for Thumbs Up, it would have been bad.

391
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,440
Why?

392
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,760
Well, he helped me out with something.

393
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,240
But, about Thumbs Up.

394
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,160
I think he really has some kind of genius.

395
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,300
- Him?
- How can he remember a song after hearing it only once?

396
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,690
Really, today he deserved to be called Thumbs Up.

397
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,640
It's like this because he doesn't have any memories,

398
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,420
but maybe he is a really famous person? Don't you think?

399
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,790
- Do you know you keep on talking only about Thumbs Up?
- What?

400
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,990
When did I?

401
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,010
Nothing. Forget it.

402
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,820
Hey. Where do you wander off every day like this?

403
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,080
I have some things to do.

404
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,300
By the way, did you get contacted by the bank?

405
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,730
How do you know about this?

406
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,080
No, that is...

407
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,390
I'm living mooching off here, for one.

408
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,960
I could take care of the pressing matter.

409
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Maybe someone, from behind, helped ou—

410
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,170
- That isn't anything to concern yourself with.
- What?

411
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,250
Hey. Make me just one song.

412
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,010
- A song?
- You're usually super fast at this.

413
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,950
Not the style from the old times, but with today's kids' music.

414
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,730
I'll think about it. Did you call me for this?

415
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,430
Actually, there was something toward you that kept bothering me.

416
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,010
That Bo Hee was pregnant with Ji Hoon,

417
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,970
I knew it first.

418
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,280
- Really?
- But,

419
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,390
I couldn't tell you.

420
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,760
Because it looked like Bo Hee would leave right away if I told you.

421
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,960
I don't know why I thought like this,

422
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,920
but that time, I thought I would still have an opportunity, you see.

423
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,510
That time, if I had told you everything as I knew it,

424
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,990
you would probably be in my place now.

425
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,490
And you wouldn't have disappeared like that.

426
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,500
Right, maybe.

427
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,190
But maybe, nothing would have changed.

428
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,610
What?

429
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,890
I gave up on going back.

430
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,570
I don't even have the slightest idea of how to go back,

431
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,860
but even if I go back now, what use is it, I wonder?

432
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,420
I'm already not the old me.

433
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,740
Even if I go back to my original time,

434
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,800
I don't think I'll live the way you remember me.

435
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,430
Then, you're saying you'll continue staying at the rooftop?

436
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:12,050
For now, I'll inconvenience you a little bit more.

437
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,740
Still, in that nonsensical moment,

438
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,560
there was only one name I could think of.

439
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,830
Gwang Jae. Your name.

440
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,470
Let's talk a bit.

441
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,110
But I'm tired today.

442
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,300
It's simple. I won't take much of your time.

443
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,900
- What is it?
- Is it true that you don't remember a thing?

444
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,940
Ah again, what's this.

445
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,030
Why does everything you say seem like lies to me?

446
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,030
What the...

447
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,640
Actually, from the beginning, I didn't feel good whenever I looked at you.

448
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,700
You remember I told you to get out of the house?

449
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,700
I got it. I'll get out. I'm looking into it.

450
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,090
Don't be evasive.

451
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,310
I said I got it.

452
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,770
And, let me make a request.

453
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,500
Thumbs Up! Are you already sleeping?

454
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,000
What are you doing? You aren't even sleeping, why don't you reply?

455
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,600
Just because.

456
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,060
We're going to eat ddeokbokki (spicy rice cake) with the others. Let's go together.

457
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,570
It's an impromptu ddeokbokki place, but they say the taste is amazing.

458
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,160
I don't really want to.

459
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,740
Oh, what's happening? It's not like you to decline food.

460
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,810
I'm tired. Go eat.

461
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,550
Okay, sure.

462
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,930
The Best Hit

463
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,870
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
