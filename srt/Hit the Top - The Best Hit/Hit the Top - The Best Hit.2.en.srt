1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,610
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,360
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,530
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,660
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,140
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,790
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,790
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,760
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,060
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,240
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,980
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,130
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,730
Woo Seung! My best friend, Choi Woo Seung!

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,790
Are you drunk?

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,670
Why did you drink so much?

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,360
Are you dating someone? You've been acting weirdly these days.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,030
Dating, my foot. What about you? Why are you home all the time?

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,770
Do you even meet Yoon Gi?

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,960
It's been a while since I've seen him since I've been so busy.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,320
Choi Woo Seung, it's your fault if he doesn't like you anymore.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,930
- What?
- You know.

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,960
If you act cute, he'll at least want to take care of you.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,120
Other couples do a lot of events together and stuff.

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,330
Do you know why I'm with Yoon Gi when I have no interest in dating?

25
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,750
He will never change his mind about me.

26
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,310
That's why you should be good to him now.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,800
- Aren't you going to wash up?
- Later.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,690
Could you turn the lights off?

29
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,610
That brat. Okay.

30
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,480
Thanks.

31
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,520
Daughter, let's live together.

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,790
We should be able to get a room between the two of us.

33
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,000
Mom is tired of men, too.

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,540
Don't forget. From now on, your name is Yoon Woo Seung, not Park Woo Seung.

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,560
Then, I don't have to transfer anymore?

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,600
This is really the end. You'll live as Yoon Woo Seung for the rest of your life.

37
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,990
Yoon Woo Seung only lasted two years before I switched to Choi Woo Seung.

38
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,680
This woman always lies.

39
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,920
Talent

40
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,970
Anyway, why do you want to be a celebrity?

41
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,100
Celebrity talents

42
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,750
Natural-born talent, Yoo Hyeon Jae who is ahead of his time

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,600
♫ Even the hope you still have left is all disappearing ♫

44
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,400
♫ Tell me ♫

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,890
♫ You can be anything you want in a dream world. ♫

46
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,570
Park Young Jae
♫ You can be anything you want in a dream world. ♫

47
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,810
Oh, right. There are many people who do not know that you were part of the duo J2.

48
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,210
It may be because you were hidden in the shadow of Yoo Hyeon Jae's talents.

49
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,830
What do you think of that?

50
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,840
Well, it is true that Hyeon Jae had more of the spotlight.

51
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,460
However, I was there behind-the-scenes writing the songs, maintainiing the balance.

52
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,630
I see. Then, you were J2's hidden producer?

53
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,650
Well, I suppose that's one way to look at it.

54
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,050
However, that is a fact.

55
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,520
Ah, Secretary Cho. Please come in.

56
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,160
- Did you call me, President?
- How many times must I tell you to fix the chair?

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,390
The thing is that that chair was directly imported from Italy so its parts—

58
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,850
Then at least replace it with something else. Anyway,

59
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,130
what's going on with World Entertainment's building?

60
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,480
By the end of this month, they say it will be in foreclosure.

61
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,750
Grandpa, hurry! Ajumma's radio broadcast is starting! Let's go!

62
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,480
Really? We should watch it.

63
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:02,590
But, whenever I hear that she's doing something, my heart gets nervous.

64
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,100
Let's go.

65
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,440
Hi. This is Choi Hwa Jeong. We have a very special guest with us today.

66
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,180
In this segment, we welcome invited guests...
Hey, who brought the chairs here?

67
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,440
And we give out some presents to our dear listeners if the guest answers the questions right.

68
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,360
It is time to send some gifts, right? Then, it's time for "Quiz Brings Gifts" to start.

69
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,640
Now, does everyone remember the Pure Fairy?

70
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,270
Pure Fairy Hong Bo Hee is in the studio with me today.

71
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,050
Hello, Hong Bo Hee. It's been so long.

72
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,840
Wow, your visuals are amazing as always.

73
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,950
Please introduce yourself to the listeners.

74
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:43,440
Hello, I am the everlasting Pure Fairy Hong Bo Hee.

75
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,260
Wow, I'm more nervous.

76
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,260
She's going to do great. You know she's not your average person.

77
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,100
That's exactly why we're worried.

78
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,160
I will make sure to come back with an amazing song.

79
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,200
If you're releasing a new song, it's been practically twenty years.

80
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,120
Sorry?

81
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,970
Oh, yes.

82
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,590
I prepared a long time to release an amazing song.

83
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,780
Back then, you released "Fool Who Only Knows Love."

84
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,780
I really liked that song. My expectations are very high.

85
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,830
We will now start a short quiz before we talk more.

86
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,540
Please pick one of the seasons: winter, spring, summer, or fall.

87
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,210
Well...

88
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,090
- I'll go with fall.
- Fall? You sure know how to go with the mood.

89
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,890
If you picked fall, the quiz will be on four-letter idioms.

90
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,920
Four-letter idioms?

91
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,470
Damn it. How could she pick that one?

92
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,130
What are four-letter idioms?

93
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,210
They're words that are four characters, but she sucks at them.

94
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,990
You have one minute. For every question you get right, we distribute a gift to one of the listeners,

95
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,610
so please think hard and get as many questions correct possible.

96
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,260
Please do your best. You can do this!

97
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,490
I can do this!

98
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,810
We will now begin.

99
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,660
What is the four-character idiom for understanding each other's feelings without saying it outright?

100
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,550
Telepathy?

101
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,700
Well, it is four syllables, but what would "heart" be in hanja?
Hanja: Korean name for Chinese characters

102
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,600
It means rich.

103
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,470
Oh, I know! Heart!

104
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:42,870
Pass. Next, what do you call a friend you've known since childhood?

105
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,180
- Since childhood.
- Umhm.
- Since childhood?

106
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,350
Oh! Testicle friends (a vulgar term for lifelong friends).

107
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,920
My Gosh! How could you say testicle—

108
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,940
Well, yes.

109
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,600
You must have been quite nervous.

110
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,860
Next is, there must be trust between friends.

111
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,150
What is the idiom?

112
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,890
- Give me a hint.
- It's one of the five moral values.

113
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:22,200
Another hint.
- It starts with boong and ends with shin.

114
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,410
Boong...shin? (Sounds similar to idiot in Korean.)

115
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,460
Hey, turn it off. Turn it off!

116
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:40,710
That dumbass. Boongshin?

117
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,280
So boongshin is something I can say?

118
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,990
No, Mal Sook. It's a bad word. Forget it.

119
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,410
Now, it is time to listen to Hong Bo Hee's "Fool Who Only Knows Love."

120
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,800
We will be back right after the song.

121
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,640
- Oppa! MJ Oppa!
- Oppa!

122
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,450
Disagreeable Oppa! You're a little late today! Aren't you going to get in trouble?

123
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,730
What're you staring at? Head in already.

124
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,470
Disagreeable Oppa!

125
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,300
- What's wrong with them?
- Hey, MJ!

126
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,560
Where were you? The CEO was looking for you.

127
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,220
Was there a bad article about me online? Some girls cursed at me.

128
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,200
Article?

129
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
I don't think so.

130
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,720
Yeombyeong (Disagreeable) Oppa. That's a cuss word. (yeombyeong - curse word for something extremely disagreeable)

131
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,730
Yeah, it is. A hundred percent right. So what?

132
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,660
Wow. Why would they curse at me?

133
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,470
Why?

134
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,550
Bro. What's up? What is it?

135
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,150
- Do you have any plans tonight?
- Plans?

136
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,140
Oh, I almost forgot. No, why?

137
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,490
Then, can you go to a club with me?

138
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,350
What?

139
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Bro, if we get caught by the company, we're...

140
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,360
I know, but there's something I need to check. Can you do me this favor?

141
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,770
I got you, bro.

142
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,700
I'm so happy.

143
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,790
- Oh, Madam. What is the matter?
- I'm just dropping by for a while.

144
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,510
You should have been careful. What happened to your clothes?

145
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,640
I will look after things here. You go and change your clothes.

146
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,300
Yes. I'll be back soon.

147
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,080
What did you eat for dinner?

148
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,400
Choi Woo Seung, you have nothing to be upset about if Oppa changes his mind about you.

149
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,770
You aren't even soft-spoken, kind or cute compared to other girls.

150
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,690
Others are so clingy, doing so many events and other such things.

151
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,580
No, no, no. Are you crazy? What event?

152
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,210
No. Nope!

153
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,460
Do I send it?

154
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,810
Ugh no. You're crazy.

155
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,530
But it would be better than doing nothing, right?

156
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,830
It's better to not doing anything!

157
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,340
I sent it! I have gone crazy! I'm doomed!

158
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,540
I am mad!

159
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,030
Ugh!

160
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,010
Please tell her about us later. Come in.

161
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:49,750
You're so kind. I'm going to tell her after she takes her test.

162
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,010
That's Yoon Gi's voice.

163
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,840
Let's stop talking about Woo Seung, please. I've been hungry since we were at the movies. Is there anything to eat?

164
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,270
- Shall I give you something?
- Yes, give me a kiss.

165
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,790
What are you doing?

166
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,280
Oh, it's hot. I must have gone crazy.

167
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:36,330
I must have been too immersed in the atmosphere. You can be mad at me—

168
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,440
I love you!

169
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,800
I sent it!

170
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,240
Ah, you surprised me! The box! What is it?

171
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,270
Woo Seung, are you in there?

172
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,740
- Hey, Woo Seung.
- Right now, I don't want to say or listen to anything.

173
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,110
Just a minute, talk to me.

174
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,600
- Let go of the box.
- If you go like this, then what about me?

175
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,000
- Woo Seung, I am sorry about not telling about us.
- I really don't want to talk about anything.

176
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,460
Choi Woo Seung, first take it off and talk.

177
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,250
I'll get going.

178
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,890
- Are you okay?
- The box—
- Don't come.

179
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,920
If you really are sorry for me, don't follow me.

180
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,280
Excuse me!

181
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,590
What about the CCTV here?

182
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,770
Ugh! I think someone hit my car and ran away.

183
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,000
How do I know about that? Go and ask the police!

184
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,650
- I am asking the police!
- Police...

185
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,510
I am wearing a police uniform but I am not a police officer.

186
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,060
My goodness.

187
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,480
- Excuse me!
- Why do people keep...

188
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,250
- Where do you belong?
- Ugh, seriously...

189
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,690
It's been so long. Even the air in this atmosphere feels different.

190
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,850
From here on, we're on our own. Okay?

191
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,610
Bro, rock it!

192
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,730
Let's go somewhere else.

193
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,740
If I see you from afar, you're so straight in the head. How should I put this?

194
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,190
Yes, you're too innocent.

195
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,480
Yes, for today, my heart needs to pound to the beat.

196
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,120
Before my mind, my body has to follow the rhythm.

197
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,990
Lee Ji Hoon, show them your capability.

198
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,940
Everyone's watching me. At this moment, I am not innocent.

199
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,070
Right now, I'm...

200
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,260
Are you crazy?!

201
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,730
I didn't kill him! Why am I here when I didn't kill him?

202
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,730
Stop being so loud, you punk!

203
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,980
So, why are you wearing a police uniform?

204
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,020
Are you going to keep quiet?

205
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,730
Impersonating a police officer is a big crime.

206
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,580
You're really persistent. Huh?

207
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,220
Hey. Did you get in touch with the owner of the uniform?

208
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,080
I have called her. She said she is almost here.

209
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,400
Why would she come here?

210
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,000
What do you mean why? You are wearing her uniform so she has to come, right?

211
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,670
I am the victim here! I was slapped on my cheek.

212
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,600
I told you I just danced.

213
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,540
I really just danced.

214
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,250
Which dance? How did you dance?

215
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,580
- How can I show it here?
- Wait here for a moment.

216
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,740
Detective! I am wronged here. I just danced...

217
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,880
I feel wronged...

218
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,690
Hey, Lee Ji Hoon! What are you doing here?

219
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,150
Well, me... What about you?

220
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,230
Well, I just...

221
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,910
- What's with your clothes?
- Mind your own business.

222
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,390
- Then why are you caught here?
- Caught! What do you mean by caught—

223
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,280
Mr. Lee Ji Hoon, why did touch those ladies' chests?

224
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,380
- Chests?
- No, it's not like that!

225
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:03,180
- It's not that. I didn't do it!
- Dirty!

226
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:08,710
Dir... dirty! I don't know what you see me as, but I'm not that kind of person.

227
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,290
- Hello, you are working hard.
- What was that?

228
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,050
Where is Woo Seung?

229
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,990
Choi Woo Seung, you took my phone, right?

230
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,660
You know I have a lot of important information in there. You're being so childish..

231
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,460
Give it back. Ah, till the very end!

232
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,140
Give me your phone.

233
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,430
Is this your revenge?

234
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,870
Nobody contacted me.

235
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,670
Hey! You aren't giving it back? Why is she like this? Hey!

236
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,270
Hey, move out of the way. It's dangerous.

237
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,400
Why is she... Let go!

238
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,560
Ah, you really...

239
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,530
Accept my shot of love. Bang! Bang!

240
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,730
No matter how busy you are, I'm going to arrest you today, Yoon Gi Oppa!

241
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,240
Oppa, thanks for meeting a girl like me

242
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,670
who doesn't have aegyo and is blunt.

243
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,240
Once I pass my exam, I will do all the aegyo I couldn't do till now.

244
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,260
Just wait a little while.

245
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,210
Oppa, I love you!

246
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,800
It's annoying. I can't watch things like this.

247
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,390
Bang. Bang.

It's alright! It's your first time after a long time, doing that much also is considered good.

251
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,100
It's better to get hateful comments than none.

252
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
You never know in this world. If this is another issue that may go viral on the Internet—

253
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,920
Right. I'm sorry.

254
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,510
What?

255
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,510
Gwang Jae, to you... I am always sorry.

256
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,960

Excuse me. If it's over, can I go?

261
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,090
You will have to remove the police uniform and then go.

262
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,900
- But I don't have any other clothes.
- Just a minute.

263
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,280
Some day, fly fly fly

264
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,720

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,690
You must think I don't have anywhere to go.

Woo Seung, I'll call you later. I'm with Ajussi right now.

279
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,840
Ugh, seriously. This ajumma just had a mood swing.

280
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,860
What did she say?

281
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,470
Don't do that. If you don't have anywhere to go, you can come to our house--

282
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,740
What are you talking about? Woman in a house with two men? Never!

283
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,390
I don't want to go either.

284
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,160
Then what would you do at this time of night?

285
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,940
I must find a twenty-four-hour cafe or sauna nearby. What else can I do?

286
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,090
- What will you there...
- Never mind! I'll do it myself.

287
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,450
Okay! Mind, off. Let's go, Ji Hoon.

288
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,080
- Let's just go to our house .
- I said I don't want to. Why are you like this?

289
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,760
- Do as you are told to! This girl, going to sauna without fear...
- What's the problem with a sauna?

290
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,120
The sauna is so expensive. Are you rich?

291
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,360
If you have money for that, give it to me. I have headphones I wanted to buy.

292
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,930
- The sound-proof ones. You know, right?
- Yeah.

293
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,520
So give me that money. I'll let you sleep at my house.

294
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,830
Forget it! If you don't want to, don't do it.

295
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,190
Bro, you did well.

296
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,470
Bro, did you call a designated driver?

297
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,930
- Give me the car key.
- What?

298
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,030
I heard the two of you had a can of beer.

299
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,470
Here.

300
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,510
Oppa, help me with the homework.

301
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,800
I caught you! You thought I wouldn't know if you hid?

302
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,430
Why does this door keep opening by itself?

303
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,860
Is it because of the typhoon?

304
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,510
From today onward, I'll become the DJ of "Today, With You." This is Choi Hwa Jeong.

305
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:37,690
Gosh. She's wanted to be a DJ for so long. I guess she became one in the end.

306
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,000
A Typhoon called Kaola, which means "time," is heading North.

307
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,700
Kaola, is a rare type of a twin typhoon that will reach Seoul around midnight tonight.

308
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:56,330
Native Hawaiians believe that when the wind named Kaola blows, lost and forgotten memories come back to you.

309
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,340
Which memories of the past do you want to retrieve tonight?

310
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,380
What's this all about?

311
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:13,700
Even in this situation, you're still brilliant looking.

312
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,350
What's that? What the heck.

313
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,160
What is that?

314
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,440
President Soon Tae is so fired up.

315
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,770
There are 10 messages in the voice mailbox.

316
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,590
Oppa, congratulations on the Golden Cup!

317
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,440
Hey! You damned little...

318
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,440
I won't let you live. I'll kill...

319
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,730
- Why don't you pick up...
- You punk!

320
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,900
Why won't you pick up your calls after causing accidents?

321
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,680
- If you were me, would you have picked them?
-Anyway, listen carefully.

322
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,600
The situation is a lot worse than you think. You're in the studio, right?

323
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,470
As soon you receive the message, leave there. Don't stay there.

324
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,710
Ha! What do you mean I can't. Yes, I can.

325
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,270
Aish. Why is this so lame?

326
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,430
Gosh. As expected, you're looking great.

327
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,300
Yoo Hyeon Jae!
Opens the door to the future!

328
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,460
It's not even a joke. What's this?

329
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,540
What's going on?

330
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,480
Gosh, I almost died.

331
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,570
Gosh, I almost died!

332
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,620
I really almost died!

333
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,470
Hello?

334
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,880
- Are you okay?
- Can you hear us?

335
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,550
Excuse me. Don't close your eyes.

336
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:31,730
That was my first meeting with my father, Yoo Hyeon Jae.

337
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,260
Additional scenes

338
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,200
Excuse me, if it's over, can I go?

339
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,750
You will have to remove the police uniform and then go.

340
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,840
- But I don't have any other clothes.
- Just a minute.

341
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,110
- Change into these.
- Thank you.

342
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,490
And, I'm sorry.

343
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:12,930
Excuse me, after she changes, you can go ahead and take it.

344
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,470
I feel a bit sorry for Woo Seung.

345
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,670
It's okay. She'll soon forget everything.

346
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,870
You know, right? Woo Seung doesn't have many emotions.

347
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:30,760
So you're saying it wasn't assault but an accident. Right?

348
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,570
Earlier, you asked me what kind of dance it was, right?

349
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,490
Forget it! The victims have come to an agreement.

350
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,490
You should see it anyway. I danced like this earlier.

351
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,600
Watch closely. I danced like this earlier.

352
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,180
♫ On the rainbow colored street, people smile ♫

353
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,570
Oppa!

354
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,680
♫ Beautiful, beautiful ♫

355
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,400
♫ I’m happy with you here ♫

356
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,970
♫ Beautiful, beautiful  ♫

357
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,810
♫ The whole world is clear now  ♫

358
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,470
♫ Beautiful, beautiful  ♫

359
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,300
The Best Hit
♫ I sing for you till the end of the blue sky ♫

360
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,230
It's said that even mountains and land can change in 10 years. But 20 years have already passed.

361
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,240
Then, does that mean I came twenty years into future?

362
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,260
On this floor, going up can be difficult, but going down is...

363
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,980
It's enough to take that punk. What else do you want to take?

364
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,290
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

365
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,510
You came out in my dream. A big fly or bee of some sort kept stinging your lips.

366
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,620
I'm freedom!

367
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,730
I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae!
