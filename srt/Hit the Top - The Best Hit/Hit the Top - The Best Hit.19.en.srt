♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,130
Are you okay, Part-timer?

14
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,060
You acted like you weren't going to come.

15
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,870
I wasn't going to, but... I'm me... and you're you.

16
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,290
You could've just asked someone from the company to do it.

17
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,980
I thought it would get better quickly.

18
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,220
If you were going to come, you should've come quicker.

19
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,480
Oh my. I tried to get here as fast as I could.

20
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,760
Let's hurry and head down.

21
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,920
Get on my back.

22
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,780
No. What do you mean?

23
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,930
- Hurry.
- It's not that bad.

24
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,310
It's that bad.

25
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,040
Then. I owe you one.

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,510
Okay.

27
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,560
I know coming from me, this is funny, but

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,960
it's a mistake to think that you can handle everything on your own.

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,200
"I'm doing well alone," isn't the truth.

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,350
Doing well with others. That's really thriving.

31
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,790
You're acting like an old man again. Did I say anything?

32
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,540
I'm not an old man!

33
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,130
Alright. Who am I to say?

34
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,230
I'm heavy, aren't I?

35
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,360
To be honest, you're not light.

36
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,260
You're getting so serious about a joke.

37
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,740
- It wasn't a joke.
- Do you want to die?

38
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,850
Did you think you were light?

39
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,650
Hey, you don't know much. But I'm on the lighter side!

40
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,970
Sure. Whatever you say.

41
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,100
It's not just whatever.

42
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,920
Got it.

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,380
♫ I love you ♫

44
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,030
Either way, Thumbs Up.

♫ I really want you ♫

46
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,690
What?

47
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,480
Thank you for coming.

48
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,760
♫ To me? ♫

49
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,250
Let me down. I think I can start walking now.

50
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,020
Don't overexert yourself.

51
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,280
That's not it. I'm okay now.

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,360
If you put pressure on your sprain, you'll keep doing it.

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,060
I'm really okay.

54
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,650
Are you hungry?

55
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,450
Well, I didn't even eat lunch today, so a little bit.

56
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,930
Ayoo, our hungry goblin must've been hungry.

57
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,560
Hungry goblin?

58
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,230
What's a hungry goblin?

59
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,630
Does it have something to do with eating too much?

60
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,860
It's like that, isn't it? It's bad, isn't it?

61
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,550
If you don't know, then you don't.

62
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,720
I saw a restaurant on my way here. Let's eat there first.

63
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,020
Alright. Let's go, let's go.

64
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,360
Why are you looking at me like that?

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,430
- Just because.
- Just because, why?

66
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,540
Just because I was wondering where all of that food goes.

67
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,960
What's there to wonder?

68
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,690
It goes inside my stomach. Would it go to my head?

69
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,070
Here.

70
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,060
- What?
- On the side.

71
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,940
- Are you not going to eat?
- I'm not.

72
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,140
Just watching you eat makes me full.

73
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,920
Don't regret this later.

74
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,660
What?

75
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,620
I'm going to head outside... I feel a bit stuffy.

76
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,380
Are you insane Yoo Hyeon Jae? Come to your senses!

77
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,410
I don't know when, but I'm going to have to go back.

78
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,470
And that's the girl that your son likes.

79
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,720
How come you're like this whenever you see a girl! Really.

80
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,680
And she isn't even your type!

81
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,080
It's because I'm lonely. That's why. Yeah.

82
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,090
Why is he like that out of the blue?

83
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,970
This is on the house. Because you eat so well.

84
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,560
Thank you!

85
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,390
Thumbs up!

86
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,280
What?

87
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,050
It's nothing. I'll eat this well.

88
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,650
Bro, what happened?

89
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,550
I'm going to sleep first.

90
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,890
Alright.

91
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,970
What is it?

92
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,470
Did it not go well this time?

Exclusive Management Contract

96
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,040
You don't have to worry about me.

97
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,680
Our contract together lasted a long time.

98
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,720
It wasn't really an official written contract anyway.

99
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,180
You're going to a big company. It's something you should be congratulated on.

100
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,470
It's because I feel apologetic towards you.

101
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,690
You have a lot to be apologetic for.

102
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,920
Don't you know that you doing well, is returning the favor?

103
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,350
Thank you for understanding Gwang Jae.

104
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,040
You're thankful for everything.

Ji Hoon, this bakery has gotten so much livelier since you replaced the president.

122
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,290
When I see you, how should I put it? I just crave bread.

123
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,690
- Is it because of the way you look?
- Why are you saying this?

124
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,420
Yeah, we couldn't say that when the president was around. But it was a little dark, right?

125
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,310
I came to buy bread, but I couldn't stop thinking about makgeolli and green onion pancakes.

126
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,460
- Everything is ready, you can head out.
- Alright, let's go.

127
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,250
- What happened yesterday?
- What do you mean?

128
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,310
I told you to go to the part-timer.

129
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,070
But why didn't you?

130
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,020
How many times do I have to tell you?

131
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,350
Girls will fall for that kindness.

132
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,700
Why can't you get it through your head? I'm right next to you giving you all this advice.

133
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,980
It's so frustrating.

134
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,300
An adult is speaking, why are you ignoring me?

135
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,970
- Let me ask you one thing.
- What?

136
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,770
Okay. Ask me, ask me.

137
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,400
Having a lot of questions is a good sign.

138
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,720
Do you like Choi Woo Seung?

139
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,140
- What?
- Do you like her?

140
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,600
You! You. Hey, you. Me? Why would I?

141
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,020
- I don't.
- You don't?

142
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,810
Of course, I don't.

143
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,560
- You're saying that you don't.
- Of course.

144
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,180
Hey, do you know how high my standards are?

145
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,720
That's enough then.

146
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,660
Either way. You may have made a mistake yesterday. But as long as you follow my lead from now on—

147
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,070
I'm hoping you won't interfere like that in the future.

148
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,330
And don't you need to leave our place soon?

149
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,800
I think I've been as polite as I can by letting you stay with us.

150
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,470
I feel a bit bad for the parents too.

151
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,220
What?

152
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,140
Then I'll expect you to move out soon.

153
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,960
This jerk. Did he visit the Soviet Union in the middle of the night?

154
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,040
Why is he so cold?

155
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,840
Hold on a second. In order.

156
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,060
Come here.

157
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,930
Hey, Mal Sook.

158
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,830
Grandpa.

159
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,350
Did you have fun?

160
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,890
- Who is this?
- What? Oh.

161
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,850
Say hello. This is my grandpa.

162
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,070
That's right.

163
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,610
Hey you. Where are all your manners?

164
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,290
Who greets an adult like that?

165
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,820
Why are you like that?

166
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,460
That's just how Shin Hwa's style is.

167
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,290
Shin Hwa?

168
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,150
Style?

169
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,790
Shin Hwa let's go. I'll apologize for him.

170
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,840
Apologize? For him?

171
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,180
Ah, that jerk really has no manners.

172
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,930
Woo Seung! You can't still be doing this.

173
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,750
The mail has to be ready by 3 PM. So finish things by then.

174
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,480
Yes. I'll try my best.

175
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,800
But it's not as easy as that sounds.

176
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,220
I thought that they would give me something incredible to do because I was interning at a big company.

177
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,560
But what is this?

178
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,430
Extraordinarily, she's nothing but ordinary.

179
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,390
- What are you talking about?
- The intern you picked.

180
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,850
She's like all the other interns.

181
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,890
- Like all the other interns?
- Yes.

182
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,650
She clocks in like everybody else, does busy work, then clocks out like everybody else.

183
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,510
But we're not certain. So don't lose eyes on her.

184
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,800
Also, how is the contract with Hong Bo Hee going?

185
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,000
- They're in the middle of preparing the paperwork.
- I told them to start preparations ages ago.

186
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,470
Go.

187
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,900
Yes. Also, the chairman is heading to the company right now.

188
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,910
- What?
- You should've told her I wasn't here.

189
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,880
I told her you weren't. But she said that if you weren't, you'd be in more trouble.

190
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,110
Oh shit, what should I do? Is it too late to head out now?

191
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,060
She said to stay put in your office.

192
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,410
Did she sound angry?

193
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,630
Quite a bit.

194
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,220
She did.

195
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,770
Again? Why?

196
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,380
Last one.

197
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,590
I thought I was going to die.

198
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,530
You really might die.

199
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,080
Oh my. You surprised me.

200
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,630
You didn't even notice the person next to you.

201
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,430
What were you doing?

202
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,770
There was an error on the pamphlets, so I was fixing them with stickers.

203
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,720
Dull Woo Seung. Are you good at things like this?

204
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,100
- Then you should help me.
- What?

205
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,480
My fans sent it to me, but I dropped it.

206
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,460
How did you even? This should've been stuck together with glue.

207
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,220
Ah... I liked it.

208
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,380
It just, kind of happened.

209
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,100
I am an intern, but I'm not responsible for things like this.

210
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,290
No, that's not it.

211
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,320
If you're an intern, you have to listen to the artists within the company. Isn't that a given?

212
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,110
- I don't think it is.
- Dull Woo Seung.

213
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,860
Don't be like that. I'm asking for a favor.

214
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,710
Huh? Here.

215
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,040
Ah, really.

216
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,850
Then, you can't say anything else later.

217
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,380
You have to clearly define this as part of my job responsibility.

218
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,260
Okay.

219
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,180
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

220
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,100
- Another one.
- Yes.
♫  Twinkle even more today ♫

221
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,260
♫  Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

222
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,800
♫  They make my heart flutter ♫

223
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,790
♫  Beautiful day ♫

224
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,320
♫ And I have something to say ♫

225
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,220
♫  something to tell ♫

226
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,820
♫  I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

227
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,010
♫  I’ll tell you ♫

228
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,460
But.

229
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,370
You're good at this. You must have done this a lot.

230
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,480
I think this is my first time.

231
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,730
But you're this good at it?

232
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,400
It's not that I'm good at it, but you have to match it with the border anyway.

233
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,990
There's no other way.

234
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,110
You're right. Then with puzzles that were misaligned since the beginning,

235
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,240
what should you do about that?

236
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,730
What do you mean? You have to dump it all out.

237
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,880
And start again.

238
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,570
Dump it?

239
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,770
Should I really dump it?

240
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,430
But, this looks like a photo.

241
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,320
What kind of photo is it?

242
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,040
Should I say it's a beautiful face?

243
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,590
It's a beautiful face alright.

244
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,710
Yeah, I know.

245
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,380
What is it?

246
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,460
Why are you hunched down like that all day?

247
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm making something.

248
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,560
Do you think I don't know that you're making something?

249
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,600
Ah, it's that thing.

250
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,260
- That thing?
- Yeah, that thing.

251
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,050
The things you put on your head. Magicians will pull out doves from it.

252
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,420
And they'll take out handkerchiefs and all sorts of stuff. That thing.

253
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,460
- It's a hat.
- That's right. A hat.

254
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,700
It's not like I'm stupid. Why couldn't I think of the word 'hat'?

255
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,360
Hey, why are you putting on flowers as decoration?

256
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,370
You don't need stuff like that.

257
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:28,620
What I'm saying is, that your grandpa likes simple and easy things.

258
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,890
Did you think that this was for you, Grandpa?

259
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,590
This isn't for you.

260
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,820
It isn't?

261
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,930
I'll make one for you later, Grandpa.

262
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,260
This is Shin Hwa Oppa's present.

263
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,980
- When you say Shin Hwa Oppa, you mean?
- You saw him earlier, Grandpa.

264
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,030
Why are you making things like this for that jerk?

265
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,710
Because I like him.

266
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,970
- Like him?
- Yeah, I like him so much.

267
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,440
You like him so much?

268
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,410
Mal Sook. Judging from my perspective,

269
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,910
he's not good. He's so-so.

270
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,980
You're not going to get super close to him, are you?

271
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,190
Well, that depends on us two. Doesn't it have nothing to do with you, Grandpa?

272
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,050
Us two? It doesn't have anything to do with me?

273
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,770
Tell me the truth!

274
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,110
What's this contract with Bo Hee?

275
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,040
Maybe it's because it's deer antler extract, after drinking it, it makes my body feel much lighter.

276
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,760
Don't change the subject. What's this contract with Bo Hee?

277
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,030
What do you mean? It's just literally business.

278
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,710
There are a lot of people looking for old stars like Bo Hee in entertainment especially for variety shows these days.

279
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,410
It is common to make a comeback with new songs.

280
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,480
What business stuff you're talking about? You used to like Bo Hee.

281
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,070
Why? Now that you've got a CEO title, do you want to keep her by your side so that you can see each other every day?

282
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,640
Hey. What are you talking about?

283
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,830
I think I'm going to say even more, so just forget about it, cancel it immediately.

284
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,050
How can I cancel it? It's almost a deal done after all the talking.

285
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,940
If you haven't stamped it, you can do what you haven't done yet.

286
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,790
- Don't you even think about my image?
- Oppa.

287
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,970
Do you really want to see me angry?

288
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,000
I've been so easy and nice on you, haven't I?

289
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,780
No. It's a misunderstanding.

290
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,740
Also, it's been more than 20 years already.

291
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,380
Twenty years have passed, so what? You can't teach a dog to stop pooping.

292
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,080
Anyway, I've made myself clear.

293
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,970
Kathy.

294
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,000
What? What are you doing?

295
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,300
Look into my eyes. Who do you see in my eyes?

296
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,570
Me?

297
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:58,520
Fool. The only woman I love. The only noona I have my eyes on. It's you.

298
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,170
I'm embarrassed. Why are you being like this?

299
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,390
Anyway, we'll talk about Bo Hee's contract later.

300
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,670
You'll be home early, right?

301
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,910
Of course. I'll be right there when the clock strikes at six o'clock.

302
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,040
I'll be waiting for the clock to strike at six o'clock.

303
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,190
It's so hard for me to live this way.

304
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,810
Am I the only one who's having a hard time? Or Is everyone else having a hard time?

305
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,240
I'll sign a contract with Bo Hee and I'll get their building too.

306
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,350
Then, that's all that matters.

307
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,800
Is Gwang Jae really having a hard time?

308
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,920
Hey, hey. You're calling out the manager's name again like he's your friend.

309
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,960
You can't do that.

310
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,020
Okay. Is the manager really having a hard time?

311
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,150
Of course, he is. I heard that the building could be foreclosed by the bank today or tomorrow at most.

312
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,520
Where will everyone go to live in when the building is gone?

313
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,920
Will it be really foreclosed?

314
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,940
What do you mean? It's a miracle he's still hanging on the building.

315
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,420
No, he still has the bakery and the agency.

316
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,010
- He must have saved up some money.
- It's more like he lost most of his money.

317
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,850
As far as I know, the manager doesn't have any savings.

318
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,600
Anyway, our manager has nothing but loyalty.

319
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,120
Even if we don't share a drop of blood, he took everyone in to live with him like a family.

320
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,710
It's incredible that he's managed to endure it till now.

321
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,160
I acknowledge his sense of loyalty.

322
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,190
After Yoo Hyeon Jae went missing all of a sudden,

323
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,000
he went everywhere in the country he could, looking for that person.

324
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,570
Has he been looking for Yoo Hyeon Jae?

325
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,950
Don't you know the manager's personality?

326
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,440
He stopped working for several years in order to find him.

327
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,580
But, if you think about it... You do look a lot like Yoo Hyeon Jae.

328
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,880
Do you hear that a lot, right?

329
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,740
What? Not really.

330
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,410
He doesn't look like him.

331
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,900
- Really?
- Yes.

332
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,300
- Gwang Jae.
- Oh, Jong Hwan. Long time no see.

333
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,610
What's the matter that brings you to the company?

334
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,380
I don't think you're here to say hello?

335
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,280
I have a meeting soon.

336
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,470
Ah, well...

337
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,000
Can't I work here?

338
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,720
More than anything, you also know that I have a lot of connections and I'm diligent.

339
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,240
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

340
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,900
We used to run around like headless chickens, but the industry is different these days.

341
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,530
Our Team managers at our company either studied abroad or graduated from prestigious universities.

342
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,560
Can you speak English? What about Chinese?

343
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,250
You know I can hire you as the youngest manager.

344
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,850
What? Part-timer. You're home early today.

345
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,290
Do not talk to me. I have no power to say anything.

346
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,180
I haven't talked to you yet.

347
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,600
You were going to talk to me, weren't you?

348
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,630
Hey, I've been alone in an empty room almost all day. Wouldn't you be happy to see someone?

349
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,930
Don't be happy to see me either.

350
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:30,010
I'm really... I'm not happy to see you either!

351
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,220
- Are you studying?
- Can't you see?

352
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,590
You said you were tired. Can you concentrate?

353
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,350
Even if I can't, I have to do it.

354
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,860
I don't have time to chat or hang out with you,

355
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,280
so I would be grateful if you quietly close the door and leave me.

356
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,630
I have a really serious problem. I need to talk to someone.

357
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,770
You know I don't have a lot of people to talk to here.

358
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,010
So I've been thinking about it by myself, but I don't know why it's really hard.

359
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,400
Aigoo, that's terrible.

360
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,840
Close the door and get out!

361
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,170
Hey! Have you ever experienced a problem?

362
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,680
- You're going to keep bugging me until I listen to you, right?
- What do you mean bugging you?

363
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,630
- Would I do this if it weren't that urgent?
- Right. Go ahead and tell me.

364
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,520
What is it?

365
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,210
- Well... It's not my story. Okay?
- I see.

366
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,850
- I said it's not my story!
- Okay.

367
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,290
Imagine that you traveled some time into the future all of a sudden.

368
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,090
Right. So you traveled around 20 years into the future.

369
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,860
But, people from there are not living the way you expected. Everyone's having a hard time and stuff.

370
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,780
But, you're not sure again if you should help them or not.

371
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,980
It's not like you can appear in front of people saying, "I' traveled 20 years into the future."

372
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,690
They're going to treat you like a crazy person.

373
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,500
Anyway, you decide it's better to stay quiet and try somehow to go back to the past. That's what you have been thinking.

374
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,960
- So?
- If you were me, in this situation,

375
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,170
would you decide it's better to help people,

376
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:20,120
or would you be as quiet as possible and then go back to the time you came from?

377
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,570
- Is that your problem?
- Yes, it's my problem.

378
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:23,850
Go back.

379
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,440
To go back? Then, I would just stay quiet and—

380
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,330
Go back to your room while I'm talking this quietly!

381
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,120
Hey, I'm being serious.

382
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,310
I'm really the stupid one who thought you might have real problems.

383
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,550
Even if it wasn't you, I'm already so frustrated and pissed off

384
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,700
because of this guy called MJ who thinks I'm his servant, and he keeps bossing me around. This is killing me!

385
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,480
So please stop bugging me.

386
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,120
MG? Ah, MJ.

387
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,710
I really have to finish going over all of this by today.

388
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,870
When I'm free next time, I'll listen to the time traveler's story of yours.

389
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,490
- I'm really being serious.
- Thumbs Up!

390
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,270
You already know my temper. Before I show you something that's not very good...

391
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,190
Stop.

392
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,550
But, this is really very important to me!

393
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,820
Hey, imagine you traveled 20 years into the future... You came here and...

394
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,010
So, there was a typhoon...

395
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,220
You're a popular star. You've been hit for 20 years...

396
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,190
These days, I seem to eat one of these every day.

397
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,910
What are you doing here?

398
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,730
Hey, look at you.

399
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,590
Are you drunk?

400
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,720
Just leave.

401
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,060
I've never seen you drunk before.

402
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,680
It's none of your business. Just ignore me.

403
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,880
Hey. If you fill your own glass, the other person next to you will be unlucky for 3 years.

404
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,070
From the beginning, you've always had bad luck.

405
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,340
Unlucky jerk.

406
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,970
Is it because of the loan?

407
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,560
How much is it in total?

408
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,020
Why do you want to know how much it is? You have nothing, penniless jerk.

409
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,970
You're right I have nothing.

410
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,550
Forget it.

411
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,470
It's not that I didn't think of the settlement money when I first saw you.

412
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:58,250
As you said, It was the president's mistake to work without writing a contract first,

413
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,100
You self-composed, sang, and danced most of the time. You did almost all the work.

414
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,390
That money... You're right, it's your money.

415
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,930
I thought I could manage to live doing the things you did.

416
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:21,640
I guess people are born into their own density.

417
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,780
I, Lee Gwang Jae, even if I die and I'm reborn again,

418
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,230
I can't do it like Yoo Hyeon Jae at all.

419
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,580
No matter how hard I try, I can't.

420
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,050
Hey. You seriously...

421
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,350
How much did you drink?

422
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,300
These days, It seems I keep giving piggybacks to anyone.

423
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,920
I remember pretty much being carried by you.

424
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,350
But, it's the first time you're being carried by me, right?

425
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:10,170
Do you remember? After we first debuted, I got completely drunk.

426
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,640
You carried me on your back to the studio.

427
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:27,530
You might not believe this, but this wasn't what I wanted.

428
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,160
I'm sorry for what happened.

429
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,380
What?

430
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,050
I shouldn't have done that to you.

431
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,140
I'm sorry.

432
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,300
What are you saying?

433
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,640
Oh! You were using the bathroom. I thought there was no one.

434
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,860
- Shouldn't you go to the hospital?
- What?

435
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,540
I heard it from Thumbs Up that you sprained your ankle hiking in the mountains.

436
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,610
I see. It's not a big deal.

437
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,600
Come over here.

438
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,390
When did you learn how to do this?

439
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,090
As trainees, we're always spraining and bruising ourselves a lot.

440
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,770
- Then, what will you do now?
- What do you mean?

441
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,560
Aren't you supposed to go back to school?

442
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,650
I don't know if I should.

443
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,990
I'm not sure yet what's right for me.

444
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,980
You're also troubled.

445
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,660
Whatever it may be, if I give up, it'll be the end of it.

446
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,050
What?

447
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,050
I'm not giving up now.

Of course, he is. I heard that the building could be foreclosed by the bank today or tomorrow at most.
