What's going on?

15
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,540
Thumbs Up.

♫ Light in the sky ♫

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,850
Why aren't you saying anything?

23
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,680
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

24

What is it?

26
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,710
My thoughts were all tangled up until earlier

27
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,300
but are the reason disappeared after seeing you.

28
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,660
What are you saying, suddenly?

29
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,970
Part-timer.

30
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,860
What is it? Thumbs Up.

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,890
I think I like you.

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,200
What?

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,350
I reined it in numerous times, thinking it didn't make sense.

34
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,610
And I pushed it away numerous times, thinking it couldn't be true.

35
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,550
Thinking it was only greed,

36
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,250
I held it in, until now.

37
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,350
You know well, that I can't tell lies.

38

41

♫  Life is still beautiful ♫

42
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm saying I like you.

43
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,700
♫ What makes you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful life ♫

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,710
♫  Until I reach my dreams ♫

45
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,020
♫  Some day ♫

46
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,100
That...

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,230
You can't believe it, right?

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,840
True,

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,680
someone who disappeared twenty years ago reappeared looking exactly the same, after all.

50
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,140
At first, I was like this too.

51
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,760
But no matter how I look at it, it really is him.

52
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,980
I don't know how and why

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,320
Yoo Hyeon Jae has come back.

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,200
I was waiting for an opportunity to tell you the truth.

55
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,520
But still, your biological father—

56
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,960
I only have one father.

57
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,310
What?

58
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,600
You said he can't remember, neither Mom nor me.

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,400
That is,

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,990
it looks like it was before he dated your mom, in his time.

61
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,610
No matter what, it doesn't matter.

62
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,610
The same way I have one mother, I only have one father.

63
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,370
And please keep secret the fact that I know, for now.

64
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,690
What? No, it's fine.

65
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,160
It must be because it's monsoon season, the rain comes and goes.

66
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,310
Part-timer.

67
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,000
What?

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,430
You're not thinking strange things again, are you?

69
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,310
What strange things?

70
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm usually bad at holding things in or pushing them away.

71
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,180
I have to spit out what's inside,

72
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,090
and make things obvious, even small things.

73
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,990
Like this, no matter what.

74
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,140
I'm just saying that's how my heart is.

75
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,500
I'd like for you to know.

76
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,970
I don't really know.

77
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,300
Okay, it's fine even if you don't know.

78
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,630
What?

79
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,970
Just follow me until you think, "I've got it!"

80
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,000
Right. There was something I wanted to tell you. Can I?

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,920
What is it again? What, what, what, what?

82
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,730
I mean, you look much prettier with your hair down, but why do you keep tying it?

83
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,970
I-It's much more comfortable when it's tied. And the weather is hot, too.

84
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,730
Let's go.

85
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,630
Even in the future, the monsoon season is the same.

86
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,920
I like you.

87
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,100
I'm saying I like you.

88
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,060
It's you. You. Choi Woo Seung.

89
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,210
The person I like.

90
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,450
I guess I should leave the room, first of all.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,840
Even if I get my paycheck, if I have to look for a room,

92
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,760
I will need money for a security deposit.

93
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,810
I don't see Ji Hoon?

94
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,500
I think he went down to the shop earlier.

95
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,290
The shop?

96
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,820
Speaking of the devil. We were just talking about you.

97
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,240
Bro! The Red Dragon dance battle video is up. Want to watch it together?

98
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,020
Later. I'm a bit tired.

99
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,500
Sorry, Lee Ji Hoon. I don't see you like this.

100
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,800
Then yesterday, it was only you two?

101
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,370
What if it's only us two?

102
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,230
No matter how I see it, it really is him.

103
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,030
But still, your biological father...

104
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,960
"I don't want to be a civil servant. Sorry, but I want to be a singer." Is it such a big deal to say that?

105
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,980
Why do you live in such a frustrating way?

106
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,830
You're back from exercising? You're quite hard-working.

107
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,350
What? Well...

108
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,920
Here.

109
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,960
- What did you decide to do?
- What?

110
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,990
About training. Did you decide to quit?

111
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm going to try again.

112
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,550
Looks like they gave you permission at home?

113
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,340
I'm not sure. It's because if I didn't try to go until the end, I felt like I'd have regrets.

114
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,820
So? You'll go until the end?

115
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,640
I intend to try. See if it's a dead-end or not.

116
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,970
And if it's a dead-end, so what?

117
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,960
There's always a way through somehow.

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,490
I'm going down first.

119
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,110
You're done eating?

120
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,690
I'm done. Today it's Drill's turn to wash the dishes, right? I'll leave it to you.

121
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,140
Why does it feel like my turn always comes so fast?

122
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,800
Woo Seung. It's me, Eun Ah.

123
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,290
Hello?

124
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,800
I'm listening. What is it?

125
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,870
Who is calling, for her to take it like this?

126
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,690
It must be Eun Ah.

127
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,750
Eun Ah? Who is Eun Ah?

128
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,180
Woo Seung's ex-BFF, who stole her ex-BF.

129
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,890
What?

130
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,400
Her friend who stole her former boyfriend.

131
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,250
She got her boyfriend stolen?

132
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,680
I'm on the verge of tears even before hearing it.

133
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,110
How can her life be so full of pitiful things?

134
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,590
It's a real tear-jerker.

135
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,090
How was it? It sounded like how youngsters talk these days, right?

136
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,240
Which part?

137
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,350
I've been appointed to the country-side, and our parents are talking about marriage.

138
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,510
I thought it would be better if I told you myself.

139
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,380
Woo Seung, are you listening? Do you want to meet up?

140
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,900
Why would I meet up with you?

141
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,970
Whether you get married or not, it doesn't have anything to do with me now.

142
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,780
Phew, I should quit this job.

143
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,440
I don't know why I should look after these kids.

144
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,210
Being a manager doesn't suit me.

145
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,040
It's making me sweat for nothing.

146
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,410
What's this?

147
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,180
Ji Hoon in his seventh month - In the living room, looking at Bo Hee.
Click! Before Ji Hoon sleeps.

148
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,220
It's Ji Hoon?

149
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,100
Ji Hoon came to the zoo for the first time.
Ji Hoon is looking at me and smiling. So lovely.
Our Ji Hoon, always smiling when he sees me. He is growing quickly.

150
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,540
He's really small.

151
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,040
Ji Hoon - Woo Seung. Click! When playing cheerfully on the playground. I hope they will become good friends who can rely on each other and give each other strength. Forever... And don't fight. July 2004 - town's playground. ]

152
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,030
It's Part-timer?

153
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,000
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

160
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,350
And I'm not pretty when it's tied?

161
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,690
I'm pretty even with my hair tied.

162
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,280
♫  I’ll tell you stories cozy like the clouds ♫

163
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,930
♫  At night, it’s too dark but ♫

164
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,360
♫  I’ll be your roof, don’t worry ♫

165
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,320
♫ Fool, you have no choice but to love me ♫

166
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,200
♫  Only to you, I can give my all ♫

167
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,650
♫  Remember ♫

168
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,490
Where were you? I looked all over for you.

169
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,980
I was in the restroom for a bit.

170
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,210
There's a meeting soon, I think you should prepare some coffees.

171
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,540
I'll send you the menu by text.

172
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes. I'll be going.

173
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,550
Oh, Part-timer! Did you come to see me?

174
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,850
How could that be?

175
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,730
- Right, it couldn't be. Where are you going?
- Coffee errand.

176
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,810
In this hot weather? It's awfully hot outside right now.

177
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,640
It's nice to have a cold coffee when it's hot, you know.

178
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,260
Really? Then let's go together.

179
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,740
It's fine, I can just go quickly.

180
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,290
I don't like it.

181
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,540
The coffee is coming out of here? Whoa!

182
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,050
The aroma is just right, too.

183
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,390
It's around twelve million for one (≈ $10,000).

184
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,860
Twelve million?

185
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,710
Whoa. It does look like it.

186
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,190
Well, I buy one every quarter.

187
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,800
Wow. You're like someone from the US!

188
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,580
You don't have to go out. I'll take care of that coffee thing.

189
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,040
What?

190
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,000
With the sacrifice of one person, many can become happy.

191
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,830
One person?

192
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm sleepy, I'll get a cup of cof—

193
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,460
Should get.

194
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,780
But where did it go?

195
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,760
Director. What is this?

196
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,440
I thought this team might need this.

197
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,700
With this, you can all drink coffee when you want.

198
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,700
And you don't need to go out to buy coffee in this hot weather.

199
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,830
The company should have installed this for you long ago.

200
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,660
Ah, you could even make ice coffee! As long as you have some ice.

201
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,290
- Thumbs up.
- Thumbs up.

202
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,040
Yes, thank you.

203
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,480
How is this? It's thumbs up, right?

204
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,170
Right. Thumbs up!

205
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,040
What to do, then? You can't get your security deposit back right away?

206
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,030
Then you'd be paying rent for a room you're not using.

207
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,000
That's a waste, even though there isn't much time left on the contract.

208
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,630
Sure, I'll look for it too. Yeah.

209
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,180
Um, what kind of room is it?

210
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,510
Woo Seung, are you looking for a room?

211
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,510
Ah, if it's too expensive I can't.

212
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,040
How much is the rent, approximately?

213
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,760
You were here. I was looking for you for a while.

214
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,730
We're doing some cleaning for the first time in a while.

215
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,690
A singer's throat is very important, but we're cleaning this dust pit.

216
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,190
President. I really can't understand you.

217
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,400
Why is a day off called a day off?

218
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,310
Don't we have to be off and rest on a day off?

219
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,170
Really, you! I did all the difficult things!

220
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,760
Are you going to keep being grumpy like this?

221
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,700
Here, you haven't drunk the deer antler extract today.

222
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,640
Right, thank you.

223
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,030
I heard you decided to do management again.

224
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,310
When was I not a manager?

225
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,870
Still, in reality, you were retired. Weren't you?

226
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,000
I wasn't.

227
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,620
It's been a long time since I came down here, too.

228
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,630
A lot of things happened here, though.

229
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,420
Ah, did you get some investment?

230
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,820
I found somewhere that would invest around half.

231
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,590
Really? That's great. Who is it?

232
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:19,270
What? Ah, that is. There's someone.

233
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,150
You, what did you decide to do? Are you not working with Star Punch?

234
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,950
Unni, us too, if there's a place there.

235
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,770
Unni, I'm envious.

236
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,170
You're putting the cart before the horse.

237
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,570
I still haven't even received an official contract, yet.

238
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,120
What? You haven't signed the contract?

239
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,740
No. Why?

240
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,010
B-But then, that money...

241
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,410
Money? What money?

242
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,950
Welco—

243
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,640
Mal Sook, why do you look so disheartened?

244
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,930
Is it because Grandpa went to the countryside? Because you miss him?

245
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,380
No. You wouldn't know, Oppa.

246
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,750
What don't I know?

247
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,820
There is an oppa I like, but...

248
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,100
No, handsome and popular people like you wouldn't know.

249
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,310
Why do I look like this?

250
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,330
If I looked a bit more like a princess, it would have been good.

251
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,420
Mal Sook. You're pretty.

252
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,490
Ey, rather than pretty, I'm more on the cute side.

253
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,710
Of course, you're also cute, but you're really pretty.

254
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,600
- Really?
- Of course!

255
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,310
Normally, it's really difficult for someone to be both cute and pretty,

256
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:50,160
but our Mal Sook seems to be going on this difficult and tough path, so Oppa is very proud.

257
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,660
In the future, you'll also be cute and pretty, right?

258
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,300
Ey. I'll do my best.

259
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,000
Trainee Group 9 Baek San

260
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,900
Yeah, San.

261
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,320
Hyung. Why aren't you coming to the company these days? Did you really quit?

262
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,330
It turned out like this.

263
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,100
Sure, let's meet up once. We aren't that far really.

264
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,230
It only a five-minute walk.

265
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,790
Then did Drill also quit with you? It looks like he doesn't come either these days.

266
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,130
What? Drill?

267
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,390
Sure, I'll come see you.

268
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,160
Drill

269
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,150
The call cannot be connected, please leav—

270
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,280
Where is he and what is he doing, this guy?

271
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,330
- I'll go.
- Ah, yes.

272
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,880
Mister Lee. You can rest a bit. Mister Lee Won Bin.

273
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,030
Mister Lee. Why aren't you reacting when I call you?

274
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:08,920
Yes? Aah, I don't usually use my real name.

275
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,580
Really? Then what's your name?

276
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,230
- It's Drill.
- Drill?

277
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,380
Do you need a drill? Here you go.

278
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,780
What kind of name is that for a person, Drill? Anyway, drink this while you work.

279
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,180
Weather like today is perfect for dehydration.

280
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,370
Thank you.

281
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,590
But you're quite commendable. I thought you'd have run away after one day.

282
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,460
Come on, even if I look like this, I served in the Marine Corps.

283
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,210
- Oh, the Marine Corps?
- Yes.

284
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,900
- Okay then, work hard.
- Yes.

285
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,380
Drill? Drill.

286

Regulation for the collection of copyright fees

Korean society for musical copyrights - Regulation for the collection of copyright fees

288
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,150
I'm dying from looking at numbers the whole day.

289
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,200
Oh? What's this?

290
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,860
Yoo Hyeon Jae is back??

291
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,720
Someone uploaded a video, saying that it was Yoo Hyeon Jae's doppelgänger. I watched, thinking it was impossible.

292
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,260
But honestly, even I, a fan of twenty years, think they really look alike.

293
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,050
From the dance to Oppa's signature expression, it is identical.

294
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,110
I thought that Hyeon Jae Oppa had really come back to life.

295
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,800
Am I the only one who sees it?

296
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,480
Today of all days, I really miss Oppa.

297
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,590
Oh my, if he said he's a doppelgänger, I could believe it.

298
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,300
I want to see it with my own eyes.

299
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,390
Even if he does look alike, he isn't up to the feeling Oppa gives.

300
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,420
Could it be that Oppa had a hidden son?

301
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,820
Oppa, I miss you!

302
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,170
They're really good at gathering information.

303
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,620
Of course, Yoo Hyeon Jae's fans have to be this good.

304
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,980
I also miss them.

305
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,350
Okay.

306
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,140
I miss you too.
I miss you too.

307
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,500
Thumbs Up Thumbs Up.
 Author: ThumbsUpThumbsUp

308
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,550
President ... Isn't here, I see.

309
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,190
Oy.

310
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,570
- Yes?
- See me for a bit.

311
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,740
The songs you said you composed, I wrote all of them.

312
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,070
Finally. So the secret composer was you, Managing Director.

313
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,980
I was always curious about who gave me these songs.

314
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,540
President would always tell me that I didn't need to know.

315
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,240
Are you not even embarrassed?

316
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,620
You're even more shameless than I thought.

317
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,110
I am embarrassed.

318
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,970
What?

319
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,890
I'm embarrassed to death!

320
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,330
But ... I didn't know what to do.

321
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,300
Actually, I was thinking about knocking everything over.

322
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,600
- Do it, then!
- Can't you teach me a bit?

323
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,820
Teach you what?

324
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,260
Songs. I want to write songs.

325
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,470
So, can't you teach me a bit? I can work very diligently.

326
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,610
And I'll also tell that everything was a lie until now.

327
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,350
If you tell that everything was a lie until now, who will listen to the songs you release?

328
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,050
It doesn't matter.

329
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,860
Look at that. You're quite an odd guy, you too.

330
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,280
Will you teach me?

331
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,590
I'll see how you behave.

332
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,290
I wonder if he'll like this.

333
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,990
Master. I'll give it my all.

334
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,690
Really. What's with Master.

335
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,220
Right! I'll tell you one thing.

336
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,780
Don't order Choi Woo Seung around as you please! Okay?

337
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,260
Second Place?

338
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,200
Well, anyway. Master, understood.

339
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,430
Okay!

340
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,990
Master.

341
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,550
This guy...

342
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,120
- Master.
- Hey.

343
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,320
Choi Woo Seung.

344
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,020
It must be your friend. I'll get going first.

345
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,600
Ah, yes.

346
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,580
Have you been well, all this time?

347
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,530
You're quite something. How did you think of coming all the way here?

348
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,330
I was curious. We were best friends, still.

349
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,020
What best friends.

350
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,830
And here, on this side,

351
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,390
the highlight should be stressed a bit more.

352
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,620
And this...

353
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,200
And this?

354
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,420
I'll tell you the rest later.

355
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,120
- Later?
- Yeah.

356
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,460
Alright.

357
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,500
Did you completely give up on the exam?

358
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,330
That's not it.

359
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,110
Someone who said she was studying is here working as an intern?

360
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,860
Did you come here to say that kind of thing?

361
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,190
Because I'm worried.

362
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,850
No need. I don't know about others, but I don't want your worries.

363
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,920
You, I heard you live off Lee Ji Hoon's family.

364
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,390
No matter how much say you two are friends, how can a girl be like this? You're really...

365
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,640
Just come back to my house. I know your situation very well.

366
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,840
Who is it?

367
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,490
Ah, Thumbs Up.

368
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,920
So this friend is that friend!

369
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,230
What are you doing here? Go on your way.

370
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,450
How can I? She's your friend.

371
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,360
You haven't eaten yet, have you? Let's go for a meal.

372
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,580
Hey, it's fine! What meal?

373
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,430
Your boyfriend?

374
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,230
Then, can you treat me to lunch?

375
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,780
I should eat something expensive.

376
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,700
Get in.

377
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,580
Hey, why would you come to this kind of place? It's very expensive.

378
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,810
- Is it our money?
- What?
- It's Yeong Jae's money.

379
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,970
Order what you want to eat.

380
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,980
♫  Is it you? ♫

381
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,810
♫ My heart is fluttering ♫

382
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,630
Here. Eat this.

383
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,170
♫ I’m thinking of you again today ♫

384
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,200
♫  So I took out my hidden feelings ♫

385
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,470
♫  And I’m looking at it ♫

386
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,010
♫ If I tell you I like you first ♫

387
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,060
♫  I’m afraid we’ll grow apart ♫

388
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,770
♫  So I try to hide my heart ♫

389
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:57,950
♫  But I’m in love with you like this ♫

390
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,860
♫ I wish ooh, ooh, ooh ♫

391
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,010
Thank you for the meal. Thanks to you, I'm even coming to this kind of place.

392
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,530
Next time, contact us again.

393
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,430
No. I don't think you'll have anything to contact us about.

394
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,830
♫ I can hear the sound of your footsteps from afar ♫

395
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,750
♫ Why are you so lovely? ♫

396
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,130
♫ The sound of my heartbeat is so loud ♫

397
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,610
♫ It makes me blush ♫

398
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,090
♫ Hello my love ♫

399
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,880
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
♫ I always looked only at you ♫

400
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,800
♫  All day ♫

401
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,030
That's really puerile.

402
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,190
What is?

403
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,080
What's this? So puerile.

404
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,560
You're really childish.

405
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,340
Well, if I'm childish, then so be it.

406
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,290
What?

407
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,690
I didn't want to see you upset, even a tiny little bit.

408
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,900
I'd rather do something puerile. So don't be upset.

409
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,720
You being upset because of her is making me upset as well.

410
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,420
♫ Beautiful Beautiful ♫

411
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,030
♫ I sing for you  ♫

412
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,130
Let's go.
♫ I sing for you  ♫

413
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:17,980
♫ till the end of the blue sky ♫

414
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,840
♫ So that you can hear ♫

415
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,040
♫ Beautiful ♫

416
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,000
Like this.

417
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,620
Like this.

418
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,940
It worked.

419
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:56,020
Oh, Bro. You're here. Coming in now? Did you eat?

420
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,620
I had something simple. What about the others?

421
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,070
They aren't back yet. They're always stuck together these days.

422
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,780
Ah right! I heard that! They say you made it to Ssen but didn't go?

423
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,390
Uh? Yeah. I had something to think about.

424
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,090
- And you?
- What me?

425
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,010
Are you not going to the company these days?

426
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,730
What are you saying?

427
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,100
Because they say they don't see you often these days.

428
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,670
The seniors have some events, I'm helping out a bit.

429
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,830
- I told the company beforehand.
- Mmmh, is that so?

430
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,820
Yes, I can!

431
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,070
It's been a long time, Chairwoman.

432
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,610
Yes. But, who are you?

433
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,740
I'm Lee Gwang Jae, from World Entertainment company.

434
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,320
Aaah, President Lee?

435
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,860
Oh my, it's nice to see you. But what are you doing here?

436
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,200
I heard that you aren't working anymore.

437
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,660
No, no, I am working. I am planning on working.

438
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,080
It's not anyone else but you, President Lee, of course, I have to help out once.

439
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,170
Yes!

440
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:32,390
Alright, then fill in the investment plan in detail and bring it.

441
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,540
Thank you!

442
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,660
World Entertainment

443
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,440
Thank you. You should drink some cool coffee before going.

444
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,930
Sorry? Well then.

445
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,410
It's really strange.

446
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,630
Ah, it's because you look like someone I know.

447
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,200
I told you last time, too, didn't I?

448
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,450
Sorry? Ah, yes.

449
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,650
Actually, when I saw you for the first time, I was surprised because you looked so much like him.

450
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,290
The person called Yoo Hyeon Jae?

451
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,840
Yes.

452
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:44,440
For some time, I waited for his return, you see.

453
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,570
Still now?

454
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,230
Now?

455
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,640
No.

456
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,850
I guess I was pretending to not know, on purpose. But it's all in the past.

457
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,400
Much time has passed,

458
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,280
and that person must also be different, but I am not the me from 1994 either.

459
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:21,520
It might sound ridiculous, but at first, I wondered if you weren't really Yoo Hyeon Jae.

460
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,140
I seriously thought about it.

461
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,390
But you aren't. The only thing that resembles him is the way you look.

462
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,960
Your personality and the feeling you give are subtly different from that person's.

463
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,400
The Best Hit
