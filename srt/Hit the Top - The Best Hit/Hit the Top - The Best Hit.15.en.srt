00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,570
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,400
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,400
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,650
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,090
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,750
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,880
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,500
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,150
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,360
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,100
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,150
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,440
I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,370
I'm dizzy. When will we be there?

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,480
We're almost there. Don't whine.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,550
Ah, you kept saying that from a while ago. I thought you said you've been there. How many times?

17
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,980
Be quiet!

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,600
Oh! Hey, hey, hey. Let's quickly go in.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,760
Hey. If we keep walking a little further,

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,060
there is a place that is cheaper, gives more meat, and is even more delicious.

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,290
Just let's go in here. All the meat tastes the same.

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,100
I'm starving to death!

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,460
I said if we keep walking a little further, there is a place that is cheaper, gives more meat, and is even more delicious.

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,590
If we die from hunger, we can't even eat meat.

25
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,960
- Let's go in!
- Hey.

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,660
Hey, the place is nice.

27
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,800
- Here, here, here! Let's sit here.

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,290
What?

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,360
Isn't that Ji Hoon?

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,560
Hey, old student.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,670
I think I like you too.

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,650
What should I do?

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,180
Lee Ji Hoon!

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,300
What are you doing here?

35
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,780
No. It's isn't like it seems. What I mean is that my plans got canceled...

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,850
What's wrong with him?

37
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,810
I thought you said you were busy so what's this?

38
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,370
No. What I mean is... Say hi to her, she is a female trainee mate.

39
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,740
I'm not a trainee.

40
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,070
I'm Do Hye Ri.

41
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,370
Hey, you're so pretty.

42
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,270
- What?
- Are you here together to eat dinner?

43
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,570
Yes, because someone said they were busy with a sudden appointment.

44
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm glad I didn't go home to eat alone in the end.

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,750
See you later.

46
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,050
Eat a lot.

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,560
With wrap girl.

48
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,900
What? Hey...

49
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,530
It's been a long while since I last heard this sound.

50
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,890
By the way, what's a wrap girl?

51
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,480
A wrap girl is a girl who makes a wrap for you. It's similar to a date with a girl.

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,850
What's a wrap girl supposed to be? Ah. You're my rap girl.

53
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,110
- When did I make a wrap for you?
- Look at you.

54
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,060
You're a woman who always yells at me like a female rapper. You're a rap girl.

55
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,820
- Right.
- What? What is it?

56
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,270
The wrap girl is giving him a wrap again.

57
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,000
As expected, that's what a wrap girl does.

58
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,020
Don't care about someone else's table.

59
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,050
I guess that's the power of genes.

60
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,620
- What are you talking about?
- It's about Ji Hoon.

61
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,450
He looks like a geek, but this is the first thing I like about him. That pretty girl.

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,350
Awesome (thumbs up)!

63
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,500
Oh, it's natural that female trainees are pretty. Why are you so worked up about it?

64
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,270
Unlike this rap girl here who is so-so...

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,730
What? What was that? Do you want to die?

66
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,050
Here. Eat one too. I'll be a wrap boy for you this time.

67
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,150
One piece of meat, and some garlic for your health.

68
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,330
Here comes your wrap.

69
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,240
Rock, paper, scissors!

70
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,500
What was that?

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,110
- You eat it.
- Why?

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,590
That must be her. The girl you like.

73
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,490
Be quiet. Just eat some meat. It's burning.

74
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,080
Get home safely.

75
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,110
Pretty. See you next time.

76
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,940
We're going.

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,510
Hey. I'm hungry.

78
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,340
Something sweet this time. Hey, buy me an ice-cream.

79
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,980
♫  Twinkle even more today ♫

80
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,380
What is it?

81
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's play on the claw machine. Hey, Lee Ji Hoon! Hurry up!

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,720
Oh, that sounds good!

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,710
♫ This world is beautiful ♫

84
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,240
♫  It’s so warm ♫

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,040
- Come quickly.
- What is all this?

86
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,440
What? Wait, let me see.

87
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,560
This item is totally thumbs up!

88
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,420
♫ Reach out your hand to touch mine ♫

89
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,420
Hey, choose one. I'll get it for you on the first try.

90
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,440
This one, this one! Please pull that doll out for me.

91
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,030
Okay, okay. I got it.

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,920
What are you doing Lee Ji Hoon? Your wrap girl said she wants that doll.

93
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,770
♫ So the whole world can hear ♫

94
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,450
♫  I wanna confess to you ♫

95
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,980
♫ And I have something to say ♫

96
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,870
- Here this way.
- Hey.

97
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,770
- I said this way.
- Here.

98
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,010
♫  I’ll tell you ♫

99
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,390
- This way. To the right side.
- That way?
♫ I love you ♫

100
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,140
- To the left side.
- Why?

101
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,030
- Hey!
- You got it.

102
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,720
Oh! I got it.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,530
One more.

104
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,400
Great. This is the last one left.

105
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,270
You! Do you know how many times you've already played?

106
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,740
Please one last time. One last time.

107
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,010
All right. This the last time.

108
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,630
Okay, here I go.

109
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,570
- Let me try this time.
- Okay.

110
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,950
♫  I’m a little behind you ♫

111
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,940
♫  So I can always protect you ♫

112
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,980
I can do it.

113
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,740
Hey, not like that.

114
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,440
What are you doing?

115
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,720
♫ Like a bodyguard I will protect you ♫

116
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,960
Wow! I almost pulled it out after several tries but he just stole it like this from me.

117
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,880
This...

118
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,980
It's not my taste, but I'll keep it on my bed for you.

119
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,040
Thank you, Oppa.

120
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,920
Thank you, Oppa.

121
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,120
Something will be frustrating again.

122
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,960
The Best Hit

123
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,830
- Let me do it, Father.
- Leave it to me.

124
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,150
Yes, it's Gwang Jae. You said schedule?

125
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,450
What schedule?

126
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,290
Ah, you're here. Have you eaten dinner?

127
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,030
I don't care about dinner.

128
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,750
That commercial, that digestive medicine commercial. Did you say you were going to do that?

129
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,930
Ah, you mean the gimbap one?

130
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,090
Yes. Hey, why wouldn't I do it when they're paying money for it?

131
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,640
If you decide yourself to do it your way, then what should I do?

132
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,260
But, there's an image you've been protecting till now.

133
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,810
So what? The Pure Fairy?

134
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,470
I'll take off the Pure Fairy costume,

135
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,520
and I'll wear the gimbap costume instead.

136
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,920
No way. That's never going to happen.

137
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,080
World Entertainment

138
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,370
- What have you been doing that you just now got here?
- I was at the store.

139
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,650
Your wrap girl is pretty.

140
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,760
- Wrap girl?
- The girl who gave you a wrap.

141
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,370
Hey! What? There is nothing going on between us.

142
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,650
A woman knows other women for sure. She definitely likes you.

143
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,510
How come a pretty girl like her happened to like someone like you?

144
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,830
Bro. Who is this wrap girl?

145
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,130
- It's Do Hye Ri.
- Poisonous Do Hye Ri?

146
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,560
Hey, by any chance did Poisonous Do Hye Ri give you a wrap?

147
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,980
You'll be late. Get out quickly.

148
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,780
Wow! That's awesome!

149
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,660
Did you like it?

150
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,500
Everyone is gone.

151
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,060
Yes, Gwang Jae.

152
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,360
First, let's reconstruct the day I came here.

153
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,280
Listen carefully.

154
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:36,650
The current me is the Yoo Hyeon Jae who came here on June 2, 1993.

155
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,950
- This is me now. Okay?
- Fine.

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,230
Also, the Yoo Hyeon Jae you know is the past Yoo Hyeon Jae that has been living here since that day.

157
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,090
Also, this person has gone missing.

158
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,170
Missing.

159
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,030
These two are different people.

160
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,080
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

161
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,590
Anyway, what you need to explain to me is...

162
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,160
From the day I came over here, until the day I went missing,

163
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,520
how the past Yoo Hyeon Jae lived in 1993. That's the part in question.

164
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Since there is no way for me to know how I lived back then either.

165
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,500
I don't know that either. I didn't keep in touch with you.

166
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:21,980
Perhaps the police would have investigated my case after I disappeared in 1994. How did it go?

167
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,470
Were you investigated, too?

168
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,280
Well, it was just a formality since I was your manager.

169
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,080
The suspect

170
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,580
I caught you. I caught you.

171
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,570
Okay then. Let me know when you remember it.

172
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,720
On the day of the typhoon,

173
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,960
after the past me went out, Chairman Soondae and his people went through this place.

174
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,600
You've been living here. Did you ever tear out the rooftop room or anything?

175
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,140
Goodbye.

176
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,740
That idiot!

177
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,390
Darn it.

178
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,050
Search the room. I'm sure it's hidden somewhere here.

179
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,570
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes, I understand.

180
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,480
No, never. Not at all.

181
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,810
After you left, Mi Yeong moved into the rooftop room and lived there.

182
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,530
- Who is Mi Yeong?
- It's President Soon Tae's daughter.

183
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,640
- She's Mal Sook's mom.
- That's right.

184
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,780
Would you come back here?

185
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,690
Hey. When you left, we really became enemies.

186
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,800
It's because of the money.

187
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,660
You'd have taken all the money somewhere else to use it, and you would have just splurged it on odd things for sure.

188
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,340
That's what we thought back then.

189
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,590
You know what it is, right?

190
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,960
Music Notes
The Great Yoo Hyeon Jae.

191
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,500
Oh, this is...

192
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,480
That's right. My composition notebook.

193
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,840
Maybe, this could unravel the mystery.

194
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,950
What do you mean by that?

195
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,250
My unreleased songs in this notebook...

196
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,380
They've become hit songs 20 years later.

197
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,820
Doesn't it seem too strange?

198
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,920
Hey, do you think it makes sense for you to talk about things making sense when you're like this?

199
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,530
Ah, I admit it.

200
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,570
Anyway.

201
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:13,010
If someone is selling the songs in 2017 that I wrote in this notebook back in1993,

202
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,710
then that means that guy is definitely familiar with me for sure.

203
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,980
Who is that guy?

204
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,440
- MJ.
- What?

205
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,310
Yeong Jae.

206
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,310
Well, I will have to meet with those guys soon.

207
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,770
There is one more important fact.

208
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,200
It seems like the money is still in the rooftop room.

209
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,750
What are you saying all of a sudden? Right. Let's hear what you have to say.

210
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,830
Why are you so sure that you still have the money hidden in this room?

211
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,880
New writings appeared here.

212
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,130
What did you write all these?

213
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,030
I didn't write them, but letters keep appearing.

214
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,930
After that day, Yoo Hyeon Jae in 1994 must-have written them.

215
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,920
And his writings are appearing one by one as time goes by.

216
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,900
What?

217
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,500
Look here. "Rooftop."

218
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,920
"Floor." I knocked on every single part of the floor here.

219
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,010
I couldn't have hidden it here because it's cement.

220
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,970
Then...

221
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,350
Hey, Choi Woo Seung.

222
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,480
Why are you here?

223
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,310
The door passcode is your birthday.

224
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,430
That's right. Right there.

225
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,080
Oppa, how come there is nothing you can't do?

226
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,330
Does it feel nice? Do you think it's getting better?

227
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,640
What?

228
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,980
Yes.

229
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,850
Oppa, do you really want to learn how to do this properly?

230
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,980
What?

231
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,230
I'm talking about massage. I'll send you to study abroad. What do you think?

232
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,490
Hey, what do you mean by that?

233
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,260
Oppa, you're so cute when you get angry.

234
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,480
I was just kidding. I was kidding.

235
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,880
How's it going on with World Entertainment's building?

236
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,530
Ah, I really considered our old times' sake, so I was just going to lend them some money, but Gwang Jae, that punk got mad.

237
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,260
I was so taken aback. He's even so prideful.

238
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,840
Whatever! I'll do it as I planned.

239
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,930
I don't understand. Why do you want to have that old building?

240
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,610
Just because. We can build the trainee's dormitory and we can open fan merch shops for our kids there.

241
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,670
It'll look great! Star Punch Town. I think that'll be awesome!

242
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,090
Then let's just lend them the money so that they can repay the loan.

243
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,440
What do you mean? It has to be foreclosed and put up for auction quickly so that we can take it away.

244
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,940
That's not going to work. It doesn't look good either.

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,100
We'd rather lend the money and put up the building as collateral.

246
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,210
Then we'd be the one holding the debenture (loan certificate) instead of the bank.

247
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,600
Ah, I see.

248
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,560
As expected, you look so pretty when you do this.

249
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,260
Ah! I'm late for a meeting.

250
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,150
You have to come in early.

251
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,480
What?

252
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,980
Yes.

253
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,200
Rooftop. Floor. Cash. A way to get in...

254
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,220
I'll be late for my first vocal training. I'll go first.

255
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,950
It feels strange to go to work at the company with you like this?

256
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,430
That's true. Then I'll be seeing you at work from now on?

257
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,050
I wish I could but I'm going to give up being a trainee.

258
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,880
I've been thinking about it for a few months.

259
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,100
If I couldn't debut this time around, I'd just give up.

260
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,340
You're the first one I'm telling you this.

261
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,580
Won't you regret it?

262
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,970
No one even knows how high up these dropouts, whom you threw in the trash, can reach in the future.

263
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,320
I'm an idiot for coming to borrow money from a guy like you.

264
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,040
Your money? Even if you lend it to me, I won't accept it for sure! You bastard!

265
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,920
No. I won't regret it.

266
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,550
It's your first day at work, but my last day at work.

267
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,330
It's incredible how we always miss each other.

268
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,550
What did you say?

269
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,210
Nothing.

270
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,460
Hey!

271
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,260
By the way, what are you going to do with your wrap girl?

272
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,350
I told you she is just a friend.

273
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,280
Of course, she is. She flirts with her friend and gives him a wrap!

274
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,090
I have someone I like.

275
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,560
Oh, that's great.

276
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,340
Who is it?

277
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,350
Well, it's just someone I've known for a long time.

278
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,400
For a long time?

279
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,430
There aren't many people you know.

280
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,500
- You know her too.
- Do I know her?

281
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,200
Who is it?

282
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,100
- Are you now happy to hear that?
- Of course.

283
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,420
My slave friend, I'm happy you're growing like this lately.

284
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,050
Did you confess to her?

285
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,680
It got screwed up each time.

286
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,740
Lee Ji Hoon!

287
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,040
Woo Seung!

288
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,620
Say Hi. He's a year above us.

289
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,590
Oh, I'm Woo Seung's boyfriend.

290
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,190
You're embarrassing me.

291
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,660
What? Why did you ask for me?

292
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,580
Oh. Just because the weather was nice.

293
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,790
I mean because the weather is okay.

294
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,090
So, what?

295
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,060
Hey, Choi Woo Seung. Pay attention, listen to me.

296
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,580
I li—

297
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,670
What?

298
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,290
I'm saying, I—

299
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,230
- You want to kill me?
 - No!
 - Then what!

300
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,660
I, actually, I li—

301
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,470
No that is, ah dammit.

302
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,680
Don't fret over it, and just go for it! And make it work this time.

303
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,630
What does she hide like this?

304
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,340
I have a lot to do while I'm here!

305
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,290
Help me out, come on.

306
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,820
What's wrong?

307
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,470
Ah really, aargh!

308
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,060
♫ I thought I could catch them ♫

309
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,060
♫  The moments I dreamed of ♫

310
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,110
♫  So I walked strongly ♫

311
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,660
♫ With faith without reason ♫

312
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,870
♫  I kept going without giving up ♫

313
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,270
♫ I thought if I gave it my all ♫

314
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,530
♫  It will all happen before my eyes ♫

315
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,890
♫ In the end, I’ll get it, I pray every day ♫

316
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,170
Good morning, I am Lee Ji Hoon, a new trainee.

317
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,920
Uh?

318
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,770
Aaah, sure sure, work hard!

319
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,420
If there's something you don't know, just ask me.

320
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,010
Yes, Sunbae.

321
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,590
Oho, Bro!

322
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,300
Be comfortable, comfortable.

323
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,350
Relax.

324
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,010
I like your eyes.

325
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,600
They're glittering, just like the eyes of a celebrity.

326
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,210
Thank you, Sunbae.

327
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,760
You're well done.

328
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,720
Ah.

329
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,110
Hello, sunbaenims!

330
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,790
I am a new trainee, MC Drill!

331
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,560
Oh, you're full of fighting spirit!

332
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Thank you!

333
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,590
♫  Why must I throw myself into the responsibilities of the world? ♫

334
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,430
♫ Why do I have to endure that pain? ♫

335
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,050
♫  The world won’t leave me alone ♫
Lee Ji Hoon

336
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,440
♫  The world won’t leave me alone ♫
Lee Ji Hoon

337
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,240
♫ I can only avoid it and hide ♫

338
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,450
♫  If there is a God, please hear me out ♫

339
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,890
♫  This is all that I can do ♫

340
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,570
♫  And I hate it ♫

341
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,390
♫  I can only walk on a path of thorns ♫

342
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,830
♫ But I’m closing my eyes and shouting in my heart ♫

343
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,420
♫ I pray for my dream ♫

344
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,330
It's an entertainment company, but the work we do is the same as any other company.

345
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,230
- If you have anything you're curious about, ask me.
- Yes.

346
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,170
I'll diligently do everything you ask me.

347
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,230
Then, what kind of work should I do?

348
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,750
Just take everything you're asked to do as your job.

349
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,760
Yes.

350
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,110
♫  Because I still have a dream to fulfill ♫

351
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,840
♫ I have a dream ♫

352
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,930
- What the...
- I'm sorry.

353
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,710
- I'm sorry.
- Oh!

354
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,290
- It's Second Place!
- Pardon?

355
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,120
Ooh, so you got the intern position.

356
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,310
Ah, well.

357
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,810
Where are you going?

358
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,210
I'll move it for you.

359
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,360
Ah no no, it's fine.

360
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,060
It's not fine to me.

361
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,120
- Give it.
- No give it to me, I'll do it!

362
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,780
Give it!

363
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,460
Are you okay?

364
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,550
That's bad.

365
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,260
I have to use it right away.

366
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,090
- My wrist.
- Sorry?

367
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,470
Exactly the same as your signature, and this many?

368
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,720
Why? Is it too difficult?

369
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,540
- Ouch. Give it, then.
- Ah, no.

370
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,870
Shouldn't he be signing it himself?

371
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,050
The fans would be disappointed that I'm doing it instead.

372
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:18,780
I also want to do it, but because of someone ... It became like this.

373
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,750
Once I've done all this, I'm done, right?

374
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,910
There are still some left, though. And I have a performance, of all things.

375
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,310
How many is that? I think it'll be fine if you do a thousand.

376
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,930
What?

377
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,930
Wait a minute.

378
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,260
What!

379
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,430
You. You'll have to do something I ask of you.

380
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm busy.

381
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,170
What's busying you? You're jobless.

382
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,490
Hey, you, uhm.

383
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,560
Ah, forget it.

384
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,480
H-Hey. This little, really!

385
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,270
What? Is is too difficult?

386
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,790
Ahh, give it, give it.

387
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,470
It's fine, it's fine.

388
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,880
Okay, quickly call and tell them to bring me all thousand.

389
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,980
And this, and this, pile them up properly in front of me. You can do this much, right?

390
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,890
And give me a glass of cold water.

391
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,820
Sorry?

392
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,140
Go!

393
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,930
Wow, it's exactly the same.

394
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,050
Go.

395
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,090
I ...

396
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:55,100
If I start shooting commercials and being active here and there, won't we need a part-timer?

397
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,160
A part-timer?

398
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,920
Recruiting a sales person.

399
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,860
You have just found a part-timer.

400
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,510
Who...?

401
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,560
Ah! Hi, you're Ji Hoon's friend, right?

402
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,950
- Hey, do you even know what kind of job this is?
- I'll do it.

403
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,970
- I'll do it. What do you think?
- Mmmh...

404
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,810
What's your name, Ji Hoon's friend?

405
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,430
Sorry?

406
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:32,510
Ah. My name, uhm, Ddabo—

407
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,580
D-Dda Bon... Da B—

408
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,410
Da meaning many, Bong meaning happiness, Kim Da Bong.

409
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,620
Da Bong?

410
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,590
- It's really funny!
- What a joke, really.

411
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,470
Then, your age. Twenty-three? Four?

412
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,100
I cannot tell you more.

413
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,220
Everyone has something they want to hide.

414
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,570
That's right, everyone does.

415
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,840
Madam, you also do?

416
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:10,020
Well, since you're Ji Hoon's friend, well for now...

417
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,010
I'm against it. We'll hire a female part-timer, a female.

418
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,780
The delicateness of a woman, the softness and even the kindness.

419
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,070
I'm confident in showing them.

420
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,390
- No no, not possible!
- It's a pass for me!

421
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,830
I like that you're refreshing.

422
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:36,560
You somehow feel like family, and it makes me feel warm here.

423
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,530
Thank you!

424
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,820
Oh, and we sometimes have to do deliveries. Do you know how to drive?

425
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,940
Of course! I am a splendid driver.

426
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,830
What is it?

427
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,000
Ah, it's nothing.

428
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,130
For work, please come the day after tomorrow, Monday.

429
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,630
Yes.

430
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,930
Oh, welcome!

431
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,240
- What should I give you?
- What is delicious?

432
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,950
If you ask about what's delicious, well.

433
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,820
This! What you have here.

434
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,270
He's good.

435
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,810
Ah, really.

436
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,020
Oh, hey give me some of that deer antler thing.

437
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,470
My body is so feeble these days, I don't have any energy.

438
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,310
Have this, your energy will come back.

439
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,520
Okay.

440
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,890
But are you coming back from somewhere?

441
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:53,610
That, you know... I can't remember again. You know, where you put money, and they can lend you some too.

442
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,490
And it gets robbed sometimes too.

443
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,720
- The bank?
- That's it, the bank, the bank.

444
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,250
Why can't I remember words theses days? It's driving me crazy.

445
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,060
So, did you talk about the extension of the term?

446
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:15,560
Hey, forget about an extension. They gave you an ultimatum.

447
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,400
At most, you have about a week. If you go over it,

448
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,200
they'll proceed with the auction no matter what.

449
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,100
Is that so?

450
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:33,120
So why did you do that mess with Yeong Jae and create this mess, really?

451
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,190
Just, I don't really know, I suddenly lost my temper.

452
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,400
But do you really have nowhere you can get money from?

453
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,930
I've already borrowed everywhere I could and spent everything.

454
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,760
Tell me. About Bo Hee,

455
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,670
if she had shot that commercial, you'd be able to take care of this pressing matter.

456
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:59,510
That is, Bo Hee contacted that company on her own.

457
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,000
saying she'd shoot the commercial.

458
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,520
Really?

459
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,070
What? Why are you entering someone else's room as you please?

460
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,740
Just, I'm sorry about earlier.

461
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,940
Right, slave. You keep on forgetting your position.

462
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,500
No but, I also started a part-time job, you see.

463
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,930
What kind?

464
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,700
Well, I have to do what I can to reimburse you as fast as possible,

465
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,000
and they were lacking manpower at the bakery.

466
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,290
Ah really, why are you moving around like this?

467
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,720
Oh!

468
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,920
Get out.

469
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,530
Okay, I get it. I'm going out.

470
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,470
But what's the passcode here? Shh.

471
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,410
Do you think I would tell you? Shh.

472
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,350
Get out.

473
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,620
The Best Hit
