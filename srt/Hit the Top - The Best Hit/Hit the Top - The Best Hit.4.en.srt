1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,640
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,190
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,330
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,540
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,170
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,680
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,790
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,100
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,200
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,200
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,820
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,760
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,830
Gosh, what's wrong with this now?

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,830
Gosh, seriously. Gosh!

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,240
Now that I look at you, I feel

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,550
like I saw you a lot somewhere.

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,170
Me. Can you recognize me?

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,540
You... The accident yesterday.

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,420
You're that person, right?

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,520
H-H-Hand.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,960
What?

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,120
Then, that girl. Why are you in my car?

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,650
That's why I should be asking! What about the others?

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,380
What others?

25
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,230
The owner of this car!

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,490
What are you saying? This is my car!!

27
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,400
- Originally.
- What did you say?

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,020
But where are we going in someone else's car?

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,880
Now that I think about it, it's strange. You ran into the car suddenly.

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,760
Were you hurting yourself?

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,790
Hurting myself? Excuse me?

32
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,770
You've got the wrong car.

33
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,610
We're all jack dirt spoons (really poor).

34
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,360
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,520
Anyway, go back.

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,140
Why don't you start the car?

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,070
I've been wanting to start the car.

38
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,640
Give me your handphone, please.

39
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,330
Handphone? I don't have one.

40
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,790
What kind of lie is that? Who doesn't have a phone?

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,750
You see one who doesn't, right here.

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,940
What are you going to do then?

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,730
That's what I'm saying.

44
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,620
What to do now?!

45
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,110
Everyone. This is Choi Woo Seung, a woman who is like a mothball.

46
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,300
Her height is 163 centimeters. Her weight is 44 kilos.

47
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,650
She's slim and her eyes are uselessly big. She's is in the Seoul area.

48
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,720
Her eyes are burning with greed and ambition.

49
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,960
That bad girl.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,920
This is my car, Pretty.

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,270
If you have ever seen this woman and

52
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:19,070
"My Pretty," please report to me. Thank you.

53
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,810
What are you doing with my phone?

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,110
The live-views are still zero.

55
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,880
Although you've been regularly broadcasting, no one is coming to see you.

56
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,200
Do Hye Ri is coming!

57
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,870
It's Do Hye Ri!

58
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,850
It's Do Hye Ri!

59
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,730
She is awesome.

60
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,100
Is she a human being?

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,060
So pretty.

62
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,040
The training room for debut team is under construction, so she couldn't wait and come here instead.

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,680
She practices relentlessly.

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,010
Look at her wearing high heels even for practice.

65
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,690
How high is that? She is relentless.

66
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
She's good. No wonder she is A team of the debut.

67
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,080
She might not make it due to a weight issue.

68
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,050
What? Weight? With her?

69
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,630
With her?

70
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,150
You don't know who I am? Don't you know me? Hey!

71
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,060
I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae!

72
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,300
Why can't you be humane and just take turns with me? I just got a sore throat.

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,500
You don't seem to know. But, I'm not the kind of person who should be out here being treated like this.

74
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,840
Yes, yes, sure.

75
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,910
What are you doing in this kind of urgent situation?

76
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,690
What do you see I'm doing?

77
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,720
- Studying?
- Correct!

78
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,760
So how can you think of studying now?

79
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,850
How long are you going to stay up sitting here?

80
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,730
It's so bright. What are you looking at?

81
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,070
Nothing.

82
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,800
That look was really rude. Tell me what it is. I hate this kind of thing.

83
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,210
I've been curious about this since the very beginning.

84
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,270
Where on earth do you get these clothes?

85
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,430
My clothes? Ah... I've always had a lot of interest in these things.

86
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,330
I like dressing up and coordinating my style.

87
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,590
Did you happen to buy them at Dongmyo Market?

88
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,660
Market?

89
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,520
I heard they sell these kinds of things for 100 dollars.

90
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,380
A hundred dollars?

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,810
Because it's so ridiculous, I'm just about to laugh.

92
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,820
This is Storm's brand. Storm.

93
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Hey. If these clothes cost 100 dollars, then your clothes must cost 10 dollars.

94
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,820
I may be great in all ways.

95
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,400
But, I heard a lot that my fashion style was particularly great.

96
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,360
How come you say that without know anything? Oh, you really something. This is crazy.

97
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,990
Well... I guess even if it seems nasty to others, it doesn't matter as long as you like it.

98
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,540
- I admit it.
- What? Tacky?

99
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,840
Why have you been talking to me so informally since before?

100
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,740
- You did it first.
- That's because I have the right and you deserve it.

101
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,700
- What year were you born?
- Then what about you?

102
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,450
Me? In 1971.

103
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,290
You look like maybe in 1973.

104
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,110
In 1974... It would never be in 1972.

105
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,550
Yes, sure.

106
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,560
It's the tow truck.

107
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,900
It's strangely annoying. And I'm tacky?

108
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,660
That's really absurd.

109
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,370
I look great. I think this is good enough.

110
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,430
They stopped because they saw our broken car. They say they'll take us to the car center.

111
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,990
You don't seem like a great person if you have such gurgling noises coming from your belly.

112
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,360
You must be really great. You there.

113
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,880
Do you want to eat one?

114
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,670
Forget it. I don't even know what it is.

115
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,810
What kind of person do you take me for? It was an awesome hit after I shot the CF. You don't know?

116
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,920
What are you talking about?

117
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,970
My own declaration to the world!

118
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,550
I am freedom!

119
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,920
I love you. Freedom.

120
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,800
You don't know?

121
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,850
Don't you have a TV at home?

122
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,640
No way, if he borrowed my nail clippers,

123
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,300
he should put them back where he found them on time. That rascal.

124
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,900
Where did you put them this time?

125
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,230
What is it?

126
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,140
Bank Loan Application.

127
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,980
Overdue Payment Reminder Letter

128
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,360
Overdue Payment Reminder

129
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,210
Notice of property seizure

130
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,520
Auto Car Service

131
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Speed Car Center Receipt
Price: 57,273 won | VAT: 2,727 won | Total: 60,000 won

132
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,790
Does it even make sense you don't have any cards?

133
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,950
This 60,000 won is like my own blood. Just try and not pay me back!

134
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,200
The thing is that I'm in a difficult situation right now so I don't have anything with me.

135
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,420
I'm not the kind of person who wouldn't pay such a petty amount of money.

136
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,920
I'll pay you back later.

137
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,800
Petty amount? You should've said you're a bum who has not even a penny!

138
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,090
A bum?

139
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,010
I may look like a bum, but I am not a real one.

140
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,150
So, don't mess around with me. You better pay me back. You must do that!

141
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Ah, where do we go now? Where is this place?

142
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,140
Wait. Where is this place?

143
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,100
I said I don't know!

144
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,440
You're in Gyeonggi-do, Goyang City.

145
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,240
When did we come all the way here!

146
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,360
What the... Did you talk to that just now?

147
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,220
From now on, questions are prohibited.

148
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,650
Then where do we...?

149
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,380
Let's start navigating the route from now on.

150
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
In 300 meters, turn left.

151
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,670
Is this thing talking to me right now?

152
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,830
Stop playing around and just drive properly.

153
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,200
Hey, turn on the signal. The signal!

154
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,130
It's been a while since you broke it.

155
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,900
Then what do we do now?

156
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,470
Right turn signal. Right! Right!

157
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,800
Ah really. We're doing all sorts of things today.

158
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,010
Don't say anything later, so if you're going to the washroom, then let's go together now.

159
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,800
Really, this must be the future.

160
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,040
Aigoo. What's wrong with this?

161
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,900
If you use your strength like that, do you think it'll come off? Hold on.

162
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,560
I'm in a rush!

163
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,640
There is a saying you go as far back as you're in a hurry (forward).

164
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,030
♫ On the rainbow colored street, people smile ♫

165
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,980
♫ You make me smile as well ♫

166
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,410
♫ The flowers flutter with joy in the sweet breeze ♫

167
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,300
♫ Greeting everyone step by step ♫

168
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,990
♫ Beautiful Beautiful ♫

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,380
♫ I sing for you till the end of the blue sky ♫

170
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,210
♫ So that you can hear ♫

171
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:57,300
Ah, what the hell was that? Really!

172
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm victimized too!

173
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,810
Ah really! Why I oughtta!

174
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,160
Why is she like this to me?

175
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,270
I could not hear you.

176
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,710
No no, I wasn't speaking to you.

177
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,710
We're going to the washroom, so take a break.

178
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,270
Men's Washroom.

179
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,100
Yes, I'm Lee Gwang Jae.

180
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,500
Gwang Jae?

181
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,350
Hey! Hey! You really! If I catch you, you're dead!

182
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,290
What the? Where did he go? Aish!

183
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,330
Calm down. Don't get flustered.

184
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,340
Let's go to the studio. Gwang Jae must be there. Studio.

185
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,960
In 500 meters, turn right.

186
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,570
You... You know where I used to work?

187
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,400
In a moment, turn right.

188
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,170
Okay. I'm only trusting you.

189
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,020
Answer. Answer! Please answer!

190
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,250
Your call could not be connected, please check the number and try again.

191
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,740
Ah really!

192
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,030
How do I get home from here?

193
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,770
Hello?

194
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,870
It's me.

195
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,930
Woo Seung? Hey! Where and what have you been doing all day?

196
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,180
MC Drill is so mad he is going to become an electric drill.

197
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,500
And why did you turn off your phone? I texted so many times but you didn't answer.

198
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,370
Something happened. I'll tell you later. In a bit, come out with taxi fare money. I'll call you.

199
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,800
Hey! Unfortunately, the only phone number I've memorized is yours.

200
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,270
Even if you get a call from an unknown number, answer! If you don't, you're dead!

201
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,340
Hey? Choi Woo Seung? Hey!

202
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,250
What? Why am I treated like her minion?

203
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,810
We've arrived at our destination. Navigation will end.

204
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,880
This place has gotten old, too.

205
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,940
Boss. Please drive gently.

206
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,790
Boss, good night!

207
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,140
Alright. Sleep well. You've worked hard!

208
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
You just have to believe me and follow me.

209
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
My job is to follow you around.

210
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm not kidding.

211
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,290
I'm switching companies.

212
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,500
Huh? What did you say?

213
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,040
I'm switching companies.

214
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,690
Hey, what are you saying?

215
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,460
How much are you getting here? A hundred? If you move, I'll give you twice as much.

216
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,230
Money isn't the issue. If you leave,

217
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,740
what will happen to our Asia Management? We'll be ruined that day.

218
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,100
Our president bought a new company building as your album has been such a hit.

219
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,850
He has pulled bank loans as much as he can.

220
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,080
Who told him to go overboard like that?

221
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,460
Hey, you really... You only know about yourself, huh?

222
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,830
Excuse me, Mister. Move your car.

223
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,230
What are you doing in front of someone else's store? Hurry up and move your car.

224
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,110
Gwang Jae!

225
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,800
Is our building going to be taken by the bank?

226
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,200
I saw it all. Tell me the truth you punk.

227
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,090
Well, I've been late paying back the principal and interest for a few months.

228
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,010
If that happened, you should have told me in advance, you punk!

229
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,400
- I didn't want to worry you.
- You, fool.

230
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,940
Were you going to tell me as soon as we were out on the streets so that I wouldn't worry about it?

231
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,250
In any case, I'll take care of it.

232
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,000
What do you mean you'll take care of it? Why am I like this again?

233
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,680
- This...
-This?

234
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,250
You know, that thing... It's a bit foolish, likes honey...

235
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,050
If you pretend you're dead, it just passes by...

236
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,880
- It likes honey?
- Yeah.
- Dead.

237
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,150
- A bear?
- That's right, you foolish bear!

238
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,880
If you would take care of it on your own, would it have come to this?

239
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,200
Gosh, my head! This, really...

240
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,490
This is all because of that damned guy.

241
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,870
Who is the damned guy?

242
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,800
Who else can be a damned guy here other than him?

243
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,770
Are you talking about Hyeon Jae?

244
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,800
If he only hadn't betrayed us back then.

245
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,080
He has all that money hidden somewhere.

246
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,560
If he died or flew up to heaven...

247
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,200
Of all things to say, why bring up that again?

248
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,070
What are you doing here?

249
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,400
Oh? Go in. I'll go soon.

250
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,570
Keep it a secret from Bo Hee for the time being.

251
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,500
Bo Hee?

252
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,990
Forget that. Tomorrow, come to the bank with me.

253
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,850
Ah, my head. Ah.

254
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,890
You're really making a person go crazy.

255
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,200
Does that make sense right now?

256
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,890
She lost her bag, handphone and all her belongings from the move.

257
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,700
You! Bro! You idiot! You believe her right now?

258
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,270
But that person didn't have the car keys so how did he start the engine?

259
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,410
He wouldn't have the car keys. It doesn't make any sense.

260
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,500
Choi Woo Seung! I think you're an accomplice! You!

261
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,100
Where did you sell my baby?!

262
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,340
Ah, really.

263
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,220
What should I do to that bastard?

264
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,990
Where do you think you're pretending to pull this crying act without tears?

265
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,050
You better speak properly—

266
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,120
Ah ah!

267
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,490
Even if I have to chase after that bastard to the end of hell, I'm going to find him.

268
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,210
I'm Choi Woo Seung.

269
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,850
You really picked on the wrong person!

270
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,570
What are you doing here?

271
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,430
Then the three of them are in the same house.

272
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,440
Oh, we're always happy to see you.

273
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,610
Why didn't Chairman Lee come, himself?

274
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,120
What? Ah... He's busy.

275
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,250
What can be busier than going to receive money?

276
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,160
But still, it involves a large amount of money. We should check.

277
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,410
I don't think you need to check.

278
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,020
Ah, he's not answering.

279
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,940
Anyway, the singer has come, himself. There won't be any problem, right?

280
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,320
Of course not.

281
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,120
It's also the first time we've paid such a considerable amount as a settlement.

282
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,070
Ah, I'm hungry.

283
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,980
But still, there's no way a person will die. They always try to survive.

284
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,600
You're really dead!

285
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,200
Grim Reaper Woo Seung

286
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,260
Am I supposed to be the Grim Reaper or what?

287
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,930
Why I ought to...

288
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,500
So you're not answering, huh?

289
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,350
Do you think I'll give up?

290
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,040
Lackey

291
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,220
What's this?
Dreaming again that FIFA U-20 World Cup will be held in Korea!

292
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,640
Our country made it to the semifinals of the World Cup?

293
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,120
Wow, that's amazing.

294
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,080
Wow, this is even more amazing.

295
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,120
Wow, who is she?

296
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,370
If I want to make ramyeon, what do I need?

297
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,780
There's no way a person will die. They always try to survive.

298
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,640
With this much, I'm amazing.

299
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,840
Aish.

300
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:38,620
What is this! Gun Mo Hyung hasn't married yet?

301
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,180
Excuse me, handphone. Are you sleeping?

302
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,690
Ah, forget it. What am I doing with a product.

303
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Where is this place?

304
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,960
Hey. Handphone.

305
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,610
What can I help you with?

306
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,270
Where is this place?

307
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,010
You're in the city of Seoul.

308
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,810
Yeongdeungpo-gu. Yeouido-dong. Han River. Public parking lot.

309
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:33,020
- Hey, excuse me. I would like you to help me.
- Please speak. I am listening.

310
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,780
Exactly what's the date today?

311
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,980
Saturday, June 3, 2017.

312
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,170
Excuse me... is time travel possible?

313
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,490
These are the search results regarding time travel.

314
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,000
What are you saying?

315
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,140
So, are you saying it's possible or not?

316
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,090
What did you say? I could not hear you.

317
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,440
Is it possible?

318
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,240
What did you say? I could not hear you.

319
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,830
Is it possible? Is time travel pos...

320
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,080
Are you looking down on me too now?

321
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,960
I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae! Yoo Hyeon Jae! Ugh!

322
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,670
These are the search results regarding Yoo Hyeon Jae.

323
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,070
When did I say to search myself?

324
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,350
I come up on this too? It's really me.

325
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,460
What is this?

326
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,320
Hey! Yoo Hyeon Jae died?

327
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:37,360
Yoo Hyeon Jae passed away on June 17, 1994, at the age of 24.

328
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,860
I...

329
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,140
Die next year?

330
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,810
- There is gas in there.
- It seems so. How come he did that?

331
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,510
- It looks like he killed himself inside with gas, right?
- Yes.

332
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,710
- Did you call 119?
- I'll report it.

333
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,750
Look at that. It's gas, right?

334
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,850
- Yes, that's right. There are two sprays of gas inside.
- What's wrong with him?

335
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,830
Oh no. How could a young person...

336
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,700
- You called 911, right?
- I'll call.

337
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,830
We're at Han River Park. There's a man passed out in his car...

338
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,300
Look here. Snap out of it! Over here!

339
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,960
Here. If you use this to break the windows first...

340
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,200
Oh? He's alive!

341
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,910
He's alive.

342
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,530
We thought you committed suicide!

343
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,080
That's right. You should live! Stay strong, young person!

344
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,940
Oh, you scared us.

345
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,200
Stay strong!

346
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,660
I just reported an incident about a man at Han River Park a while ago.

347
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,980
Yes, he's alive.

348
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,170
That's right. You should live, Yoo Hyeon Jae.

349
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,870
This problem isn't going to be resolved with you daydreaming.

350
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,800
Let's go to the workplace first since everything started from there.

351
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,950
I'll really send Choi Woo Seung to jail. Just wait and see.

352
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,880
Ey, I'll make you ramyeon. Relax.

353
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,300
- The car has gone missing and you talk of making ramyeo—
- I'll put an egg in it.

354
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,650
If you put an egg in it, what about my insides? It makes me feel better.

355
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,290
- Yes, of course. It does comfort me a bit.
- Okay.

356
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,300
Oh? Those guys...

357
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,070
They live here too?

358
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,140
What? You didn't go to the academy?

359
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,700
Hurry up and bring back my car! If not, I'm going to call the police.

360
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,660
Whether you tell the police or not, do whatever you want. I'm going to find that bastard and kill him first.

361
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,800
- What are you saying? Kill who?
- That bastard.

362
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,050
If you mean that bastard... That bastard?

363
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,670
If you think now, it was all planned. Coming in front of that shitty car itself was a plan.

364
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,510
Eh, what do you mean shitty car!

365
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,280
You don't even know where he is. Where and how are you going to find him?

366
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,720
Our country is surrounded by water on three sides and the 38th parallel.

367
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,200
Even if he tries to run away, where would he go!

368
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,060
Don't get too worked up and say something that makes sense.

369
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,150
I lost all my belongings with my eyes open. Wouldn't you be angry?

370
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:48,370
Hey, it's not like you know his contact information or address, but you're just going to go look for him without a plan?

371
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,880
Let go! I'll find him no matter what.

372
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,540
- So how?
- Somehow!

373
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,790
Excuse me.

374
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,600
Oh? That damned bastard!

375
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,900
Hey! You...

376
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,980
Hey, wait.

377
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:14,600
♫ Beautiful. Beautiful. ♫

378
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:23,000
♫ I sing for you till the end of the blue sky ♫

379
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,880
♫ So that you can hear ♫

380
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,380
♫ Beautiful. ♫

381
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,000
Additional scenes

382
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,240
It'll all work out well. No matter what anyone says, your rap is killer!

383
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,170
Are you lacking in anything? Both your singing and dancing are no joke.

384
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:44,550
- Still, in comparison to your level of rap, I'm still a joke.
- As if. It sounds like a joke.

385
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,620
If you're a joke, then are all Korean singers a joke?

386
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:53,280
-I'm saying this since we're talking about it. It's the first time I've seen a rapper with such force and masculine charm as you.
- Ah!

387
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,500
Show me your handsome muscles.

388
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,140
I can show you my muscles.

389
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,510
Hey. Your proportions are a lot better!

390
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,850
With a ratio like yours, I'd say you are a 1:8 ratio.

391
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,740
No. You seem to be at least a 1:9 ratio. Yes, a 1:9 ratio.

392
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,770
If we just debut, the whole country will go mad. It'd be really great!

393
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,410
Yo, bro!

394
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:44,370
♫ Hey! The shadow behind you is me ♫

395
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,790
Ah, it's cold...

396
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,400
♫  I’m a little behind you ♫

397
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,510
♫  So I can always protect you ♫

398
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,700
♫ Come a little closer ♫

399
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,250
♫ Come into my arms ♫

400
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:02,630
♫  Like a body guard I’ll protect you ♫

401
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,110
Ah, bro. Did you see how they couldn't even look us in the eye?

402
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,780
Who cares about idols or ninth-class rookies like us? They just became like squids because we were in front of them.

403
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,500
Don't you think so?

404
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,670
You idiot. Just wear your clothes properly.

405
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,620
♫ And I have something to say ♫

406
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,380
♫  Something to tell ♫

407
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,290
♫  I wanna love you  ♫

408
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,990
♫ Beautiful. Beautiful.  ♫

409
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,720
♫ I’m happy with you here ♫

410
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,420
♫ Beautiful. Beautiful.  ♫

411
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,100
♫ The whole world becomes clear ♫

412
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,720
♫ Beautiful. Beautiful.  ♫

The Best Hit

414
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,780
Since I was hit by your car, I can't remember anything.

415
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,540
This person really is a conman!

416
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,910
Hey! Do you guys even know who I am?

417
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,320
What? You were born in 1971?

418
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,680
Firstly, let's just take him with us.

419
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,970
If you clean all this here, I'll buy you a cellphone.

420
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,480
There's something strange on the rooftop room.

421
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,900
It's not my first, but I think someone else is there other than Oppa.

422
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,320
I told you to follow me without lagging, right?

423
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,560
♫ It makes me blush ♫

424
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,870
♫ Hello my love ♫
