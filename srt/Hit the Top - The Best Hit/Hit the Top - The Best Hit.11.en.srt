1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,580
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,230
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,460
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,530
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,020
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,800
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,840
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,520
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,040
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,230
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,220
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,200
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,880
So, I'll assume that it's the second and fourth Saturday for the time being.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,030
Alright.

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,780
No, it's not because they are my kids. You'll never regret it.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,170
Yes. When I first heard the name "Helter-Skelter", I thought it was some kind of rice cake place.

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,960
Wherever their fans are, Helter-Skelter will go running hurriedly in all directions until they reach their fans.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,000
That's the meaning behind their name.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,690
Is there an event over there?

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,030
Yes. There's an event today, the reason why customers are there.

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,210
Why is that child here?!

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,990
What?

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,640
Ah, this one... really!

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,830
Hey. I told you not to touch someone else's property.

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,530
What do you mean someone else's?

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,630
It's my watch!

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,920
What the hell? Why is this yours? This is mine!

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,630
Give it to me. I will check it out.

29
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,490
Oh. Really... Hey.

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,530
Look at this. Is this still your watch?

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,390
The initials are different!

32
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,980
Right, initials are not yours, Ji Hoon.

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,500
Oh...

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,330
Well... this watch is a keepsake from my late father.

35
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,720
What?

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,590
A keepsake from your late father?

37
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,590
Hey! Lee Ji Hoon!

38
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,750
What are you doing here? I need to talk to you.

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,240
- Father, it's not—
- Follow me!

40
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,230
What are they talking about?

41
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,680
It's not the first time they met today?

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,550
I know.

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,930
I warned you to stay still and quiet, right?

44
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,080
- No, I tried to do well.
- What do well?

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,950
Whatever you want to do, don't do anything!

46
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,500
Oh, stop blaming me. By the way, what is it about the watch?

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,010
What do you speak about a watch suddenly?

48
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,630
Ji Hoon said it was a keepsake from his late father.

49
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,730
When did you die secretly?

50
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,090
Why Ji Hoon said my watch is his belonging?

51
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,020
I don't know. I don't know. What are you talking about?

52
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,950
Tell me. What happened?

53
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,570
- What do you speak about?
- Don't change topic.

54
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,020
What is it? What do you know? What is this about?

55
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,340
Ji Hoon is not your son?

56
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,460
Yes, Lee Ji Hoon...

57
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,190
is not my son.

58
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,090
Ji Hoon...

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,870
- is your son.
- Look! I was sure that...

60
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,540
What?

61
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,370
- What?
- He is my... what?

62
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,450
The Best Hit

63
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,670
He is someone you know?

64
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,380
Know him? How would I know a kid like him? It's our first time meeting.

65
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,440
- It's also the first time I'm seeing a kid like him.
- Kid?

66
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,030
No manners! Did you just call me a kid?

67
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,370
No... No, Mister.

68
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,290
But, Ajusshi, what did you talk about earlier if this is your first time meeting?

69
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:23,190
Oh? Oh, I just happened to see him.

70
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,760
He can dance quite well. So I thought maybe we could scout him.

71
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,920
- Scout him?
- I've talked to him about it,

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,360
But, I can't do it anymore because he's too rude.

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,080
You know, World Entertainment values personality over talent.

74
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,490
Thumbs Up has strangely an awful personality.

75
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,700
By the way, Ji Hoon. I saw you on stage earlier. You're not thinking about performing or anything else, are you?

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,360
If you go around knocking on talent agency doors in vain like before, I'm not going to a stay still.

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,350
It's not like that. Earlier, I wanted to get a new handphone, so I asked him to go on stage for that.

78
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,610
Is that so?

79
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,370
Please drop us off over there. We'll take the subway from here.

80
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,250
Here. I got this one after shooting a commercial.

81
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,380
Look. I have my initials in front. This watch is one of a kind in the world. Isn't it great?

82
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,320
Oh! This is cool. You must be happy.

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,240
What is it?

84
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,470
You're going to have to wear a suit from now so I think you'll need a watch.

85
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,050
Hey! How much... How much is it?

86
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,030
Hey, hey! Hey, does this even suit me?

87
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,070
I don't want it. It's too burdensome.

88
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,930
Lee Gwang Jae, you only have to trust me and follow me.

89
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,520
What trust and follow you?

90
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:23,010
Ah... All of a sudden?

91
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,400
I have a son?

92
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,420
Why are you awake and sitting there?

93
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,910
Oh, I just can't sleep.

94
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,310
Do you want me to make you something?

95
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,400
Hey, no, no. I'm fine. I should go to bed now.

96
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,220
Wait a minute I'll cut some fruits for you.

97
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,990
I guess we ate all the pears I bought the last time.

98
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,470
There are some sausages, so I'm going to grill them.

99
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,900
Hey, why are you eating so late at night?

100
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,060
- I won't eat this—
- Then what about later?

101
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,720
You'll be whining about gaining weight. Eat moderately.

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,520
Grandpa, are you eating something?

103
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,470
Ghost kid! I'm not eating! I won't eat. I won't eat!

104
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,440
Where did he go?

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,290
Ah, really. Hey, you're crazy?

106
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,350
I told you to not get caught by my family members at all. Yet you come down to my house.

107
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,230
I'm so curious that I couldn't help it.

108
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,090
- What if someone sees you?!
- So what?

109
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,820
Just come with me. Follow me.

110
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,630
Hey! Hey, are you crazy?

111
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,990
Have you decided what to do as a part-time job?

112
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,450
First, I'm getting paid for doing some odd jobs here and there. But they're not stable.

113
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,090
Where are there any part-time jobs that are easy, only a few work hours and give high pay?

114
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,030
Let me know if there is any place like that.

115
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,490
Come on. You're the son of a building owner.

116
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,000
What building owner? Let's go up together.

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,620
I'll go up in a bit.

118
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,840
Let's just go in. It's dark. You shouldn't walk around alone.

119
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:49,130
That punk. Ji Hoon has been hanging out with Woo Seung a lot these days.

120
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,990
Is that important now? Anyway, tell me how exactly this happened?

121
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,020
I don't understand no matter how much I think about it.

122
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,110
Let's say Ji Hoon is my son. Then who is his mom?

123
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,990
You really don't know?

124
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,960
I really don't know! I said I don't know!

125
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,130
I'll wait for you forever.

126
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,610
Bo Hee...

127
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,530
Hong Bo Hee?

128
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,180
By any chance... Is it Bo Hee?

129
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,760
How much do you remember?

130
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,030
The day I got the Golden Cup, and when I told you I was changing agencies.

131
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,890
So, you don't remember you were secretly dating Bo Hee?

132
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,170
Bo Hee and I were secretly dating?

133
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,520
No. Why?

134
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,260
Why are you asking me? When you two secretly dated.

135
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,200
This is really driving me crazy.

136
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,750
So, you're saying that Boo Hee and I were seeing each other...

137
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,910
I don't know the details. From what I know, you two secretly dated for a year.

138
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,520
Then Bo Hee got pregnant with Ji Hoon, and you suddenly disappeared without leaving a trace.

139
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,200
I searched for you all over the country but I couldn't find you.

140
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,150
So Bo Hee and I were in a secret relationship, then she got pregnant with Ji Hoon.

141
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:09,920
Never mind. I said to forget it. Bo Hee and Ji Hoon have nothing to do with you now.

142
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,440
So just be quiet while you're here and go back quietly.

143
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,110
That's what is best for everyone.

144
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,610
- No.
- No?

145
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,910
You've always lived for yourself all your life.

146
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,590
I'm not asking you to do anything. I'm just asking you to do nothing.

147
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,740
Just this once, for our own sake, please do nothing.

148
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,190
Just stay quiet and then disappear! Do you understand?

149
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,640
There too.

150
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,990
Quickly.

151
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,830
Here too.

152
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,780
What are you guys doing?

153
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,770
Can't you see? I almost fainted after taking a shower when I saw this. How come there is mold sticking around...

154
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,300
I think it's pretty clean now.

155
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,900
Hey. All the time the bathroom is a mess because you only clean it this roughly.

156
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,870
But, why should we do the cleaning?

157
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,220
Didn't you do this during the time you've been using this bathroom?

158
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,920
We were living well together with the mold.

159
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,230
It's better without the mold.

160
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,820
Hey. Your hands are too slow.

161
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,540
Do you want to stay up cleaning all night?

162
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,410
No!

163
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,140
No. It can't be possible at all.

164
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,940
There is no way that my DNA could have that sort of inferiority.

165
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,540
No, it can't be possible.

166
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,220
No!

167
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,370
World Entertainment

168
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,830
What son?

169
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,830
Look at him. He looks completely different from me.

170
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,360
No. He can't be my son.

171
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,830
- Decide.
- What?

172
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,410
This way or that way?

173
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,010
How come you dare point with your chin to your elder?

174
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,580
What elder? Move aside!

175
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,090
That brat really.

176
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,230
Grandpa, I have a dictation test.

177
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,620
Your grandpa is exercising now.

178
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,850
It's homework. Here, dictate them for me.

179
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,270
Hey. My body was feeling better after exercising.

180
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,580
- Please just read those words.
- Okay, kid.

181
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,530
You should be thankful that I still have a good eyesight.

182
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,650
I'm starting now.

183
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,340
I'm ready.

184
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,570
What? Where did you get that rice cake?

185
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,100
Give your grandpa just one bite of it. Ah...

186
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,290
Ah. It's gone.

187
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,600
Okay. With that kind of attitude and spirit, you'll never starve.

188
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,340
I'm starting!

189
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,060
Who could it be?

190
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,870
Yes. Crazy dog.

191
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,470
Crazy dog.

192
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,650
What? What a f**king joke!

193
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,590
What a f**king joke...

194
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,340
- What? How dare you order me around like this?
- How dare you order me...

195
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,960
What?

196
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,350
- Grandpa, you're too fast.
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

197
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,830
Mal Sook, I have to take this call. Let's do this later, okay?

198
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,360
Hello?

199
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,810
It's homework.

200
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,750
You're talking nonsense!

201
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,220
Tell him to make time no matter what, dude!

202
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,660
That's right!

203
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,830
That punk. He needs some discipline.

204
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,840
Hi, Oppa!

205
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,650
Who is your oppa, you punk?

206
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,170
- Hi, CEO Lee.
- Hello.

207
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,370
How is it hard to see you when we all live in the same neighborhood?

208
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,640
You've grown up so much.

209
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,660
Oppa. My real oppa has come.

210
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,150
Next time, let's greet each other with smiles on our faces.

211
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,120
Oppa!

212
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,700
She calls anyone oppa.

213
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,980
She's just usually kind of cheerful.

214
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,250
Do we freeze and die from cheerfulness?

215
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,820
Hey! In that sense, Yeong Jae is the pitiful one. Poor him.

216
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,620
What pitiful? Yeong Jae became this successful thanks to his wife.

217
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,030
What success? She's afraid that her husband will run away with only her property.

218
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,040
Hey! They aren't legally married. She hasn't even registered her marriage.

219
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,680
Anyway, you know everything about other people's affairs.

220
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,890
That's how I am. I'm Lee Soon Tae, you punk.

221
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,660
Why are you talking to them like that?

222
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,730
How long have we known them? Should I just ignore them?

223
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,320
If you look at it, you're very narrow-minded when it comes to dealing with these kinds of matters.

224
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,750
CEO Park Yeong Jae

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,730
You're cute!

226
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,840
Still, I don't like it.

227
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:17,700
I heard you said you'd tear down their building and set up a new training center there.

228
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,780
Well, the thing is that we need a new dormitory for our trainees anyway.

229
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,490
And it's close to our office building.

230
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,400
Oppa Soon Tae won't accept it that easily. Why would you make things difficult for everyone?

231
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,820
It's not how you should run the business.

232
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,880
Instead, I'll find you a much better place.

233
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,050
Just accept what I give you.

234
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,300
It's eel. Here.

235
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,190
Ah, really. It's not even day or two but you always treat me like a child.

236
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,100
You're always nagging me like I'm a child.

237
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,820
It's my work. I'll take care of it myself. You step aside from this matter.

238
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,640
When did I treat you like a child?

239
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,250
Okay, I got it. I'll take my hands off it.

240
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,220
Eat this first.

241
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,870
Here the eel comes!

242
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,030
You mean it, right?

243
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:11,610
Right. You said you'd take care of the company management anyway.

244
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,060
Instead, I'll keep the company seal for now.

245
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,910
What? How did you know the safe's passcode?

246
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,710
Anyway, you're naive to a fault.

247
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,590
Then you're the one who wrote random things in this notebook without me knowing?

248
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,400
What? Ah, Hyeon Jae's composition notebook?

249
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,330
Oppa, I was just kidding around to surprise you.

250
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,240
Ah, I didn't know it was you.

251
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,440
You were surprised, right?

252
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,860
Who was surprised? I wasn't.

253
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,490
Also, how am I supposed to make payments if you take the seal?

254
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,960
Ah. Please let me know if you have anything to pay or approve for now.

255
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,230
No. I'll give it back to you if you catch me.

256
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,430
Oppa, catch me if you can!

257
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,130
- Catch me if you can!
- Where are you going?

258
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,020
Catch me if you can.

259
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,120
You'll be dead meat when I catch you.

260
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,930
Oppa~
Who am I?
Son?

261
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,650
Son???

262
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,770
Son????

263
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:39,630
What did I do so wrong to deserve all this?

264
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,590
Out of the blue, I happened to travel 20 years into the future.

265
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,090
Out of nowhere, I happen to have a son I've never seen in my whole life.

266
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,390
From now on, I'm looking forward to what will happen to me next. I'm looking forward to it.

267
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,270
So, what are you going to do now?

268
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,420
The male pre-debut team has been formed.

269
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,120
From now on, that means no other male teams will debut for two or three years.

270
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,730
So you both have problems with your age, you're pretty old. And you both have to serve in the military.

271
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,140
I think you already have a lot on your mind.

272
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,470
Bro. Rest a little while.

273
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,720
I need to keep myself busy by moving my body dancing,

274
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,630
or else many useless thoughts come into my mind.

275
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,010
I know.

276
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,770
Then, let's go out.

277
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,410
It's been a while since we last breathed some fresh air. Let's go shopping for some training clothes.

278
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,190
- How is it?
- Forget it.

279
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,220
Ah. Why not?

280
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,620
Let me borrow Ji Hoon today.

281
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,240
All of a sudden, you startled me.

282
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,060
Hey, is Ji Hoon a kind of object? You can't borrow people.

283
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,730
Also, even if he was one, I wouldn't lend him to you. Ji Hoon and I are going shopping.

284
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,570
Give that to me.

285
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,990
What are you doing?

286
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,970
I heard you like free stuff. Get one from there.

287
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,890
Lee Ji Hoon, you come with me.

288
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,730
Hey, where are you taking me?

289
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,160
Hey, Bro!

290
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,050
Hey. What a brat!

291
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,770
Poisonous Do Hye Ri. What a cheeky brat!

292
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,660
Eat this and tell me what it tastes like.

293
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,100
You can eat it yourself.

294
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,800
I'm debuting soon. I need to take care of my body.

295
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,330
You failed anyway.

296
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,340
Thank you for reminding me about my situation.

297
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,010
- Why should I eat—
My fans sent them to me.

298
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,120
- Then should I not eat them and throw them away?
- What?

299
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,590
You must tell me how delicious they are after eating them. I have to give them a review.

300
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,750
Hey. I heard you get fans when you manage to get into a debut team. That's amazing.

301
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,640
I'm a bit envious of you.

302
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,250
Envious of me?

303
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,820
What are you envious of?

304
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:24,650
You know. You're always so confident, sure of yourself and talented.

305
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,570
I'm not even like that.

306
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,270
Do you know Snow White, right?

307
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,870
Strangely, since I was a little kid, I've liked the queen more than Snow White.

308
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,560
- What?
- Even if the queen thinks she has the world by her side,

309
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,640
she always asks the magic mirror about herself because she feels insecure and anxious.

310
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,840
So that's how I figured out that everyone is only pretending.

311
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,440
They're anxious and suffering but they just pretend they are not.

312
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,040
That comforts me.

313
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,180
Do you think I'm crazy?

314
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,640
A little bit.

315
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,880
- Hey, I was just joking.
- Whatever.

316
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,700
How does it taste?

317
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,250
- It tastes like cheese.
- With more sincerity!

318
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,750
Oh, well, It tastes like cheese but a little deeper than normal ones.

319
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,710
So, what does it taste like?

320
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,380
It feels like as If I was sitting on the hill of Montmartre

321
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,870
and looking at the Eiffel Tower far in the distance.

322
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,740
The cheese spreads softly in my mouth.

323
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,210
It's just that romantic feeling.

324
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,710
- Have you been to France?
- Do I have to go? I can still imagine it.

325
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,520
I'll just say that the cheese taste was delicious.

326
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,380
Next. You eat this one too.

327
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,650
Thank you.

328
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,850
Goodbye.

329
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,970
Goodbye.

330
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,630
What is it?

331
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,260
What? It's nothing.

332
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,300
Are you sure you don't have anything to say to me?

333
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,270
No. I don't

334
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:04,470
Oh, right. About the shooting that day, I'll definitely convince Director Park to edit out your part of the show.

335
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,430
Don't worry too much about it.

336
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,270
Forget it. I don't care about it.

337
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,020
What? Why not?

338
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,090
I think those people...

339
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,990
Let's talk.

340
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,290
They didn't do it on purpose.

341
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,480
It's my mistake.

342
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,590
Don't try too hard...

343
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,480
Where did you go again?

344
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,360
Are you crazy? Why do you keep coming down?

345
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,970
I told you to keep hidden and stay still!

346
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,980
No. I have something to tell you, but there's no way to contact you.

347
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,350
Still, you can't do that all of a sudden...

348
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,330
Hey. You said you got a handphone as a prize the other day, right?

349
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,420
Yes, your handphone has service now.

350
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,640
So now I can use this to make calls and surf the internet, right? Even without WiFi?

351
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,240
Yes, of course.

352
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,510
It's working. It's working.

353
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,100
- Is it possible to track down its location?
- What?

354
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,050
Yes, sure. if you press this icon, you'll be able to see its location.

355
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,620
Can you see it?

356
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,850
Wow! Gwang Jae! Look at this! Look at this!

357
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,270
This is really awesome (thumbs up)!

358
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,810
My younger brother is very ill.

359
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,550
Keep it a secret. Don't tell the guys.

360
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,470
They'll find it strange if they find out I opened the service for you.

361
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,620
Also, I saved my phone number in your phone,

362
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,250
so call me only when you really need to. Do you understand?

363
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,160
I understand.

364
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,010
- Try to not call me even when you need me.
- Ah, really!

365
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,260
So, what was it that you want to tell me?

366
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,080
I'm going to meet Bo Hee.

367
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,490
What?

368
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,220
That's right. I should ask her what happened. So I first need to meet Bo Hee—

369
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,150
- Hey, Yoo Hyeon Jae! Listen to me clearly.
- Why are you like this again?

370
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,490
Whether you remember or not, she suffered so much because of you.

371
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,310
I told you that you don't deserve to appear in front of her, right?

372
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:10,070
The best you can do for her is to remain quiet as if you were non-existent!

373
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,780
Do you understand what I mean?!

374
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,970
Okay. I got it.

375
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,910
Wow! A day like this is hotter for no reason. It's hot, so it'll be troublesome for you.

376
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,680
I'm getting paid so it's not troublesome.

377
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,320
I will do my best!

378
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,340
Ah, right. You should never take off your doll costume in front of people.

379
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,550
Aigoo. Do I do business a day or two? I'm not a beginner. That's the basics.

380
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,220
- Okay, fighting!
- Fighting!

381
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,710
Hey, I like you. I like your spirit.

382
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,440
♫ And I have something to say ♫

383
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,270
♫ Something to tell ♫

384
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,780
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

385
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,060
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

386
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,810
♫ I love you ♫

387
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,520
So, from now on what are you going to do, you punk?
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

388
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,190
What do you mean, what should I do?

389
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,820
Hey! Sit down, sit down.

390
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,540
Take a seat

391
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:16,180
Hey, how long are you going to stay around her like an idiot?

392
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,230
Don't you like Bo Hee?

393
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,840
What?

394
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,470
Hey, come on.

395
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,230
You sneaky idiot.

396
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,660
I think it'll be hard for Bo Hee to make a comeback as a singer.

397
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,600
She even suspects that.

398
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,180
You already waited for 20 years. You've waited long enough now.

399
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,370
I just want you guys to get together now.

400
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,240
- What?
- Hey, you punk.

401
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,890
Do you think you will live for ten million years?

402
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:50,680
If you waste your time sitting around, you'll regret it as you grow older later.

403
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,790
If you have anything to confess to her, just confess it.

404
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,800
What?! What confession?

405
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,490
If Hyeon Jae isn't going to come back alive, then that's the right thing to do.

406
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,590
No, no. Even if he comes back alive, that's still the right thing to do.

407
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,150
Do you understand what I mean?

408
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,100
Questions on Yoo Hyeon Jae's disappearance

409
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:22,800
The only food Oppa Yoo Hyeon Jae can't eat is...?

410
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,390
Peanut butter!

411
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,230
Here we go.

412
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,360
Please register to become a member of the cafe.
You'll be asked to wait for your regular member upgrade via email.

413
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,160
Ah, it's very complicated.

414
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,230
Aigoo.

415
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,840
Seonjae Korean Language (text book)

416
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,400
Why does everyone want to become a civil servant worker?

417
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,810
I have no idea what all this is about even when I read it.

418
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,020
Choreography N°32

419
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,290
Turn here.
Two times.

420
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,430
I'll break the walls and catch it...

421
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,460
What is this?

422
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,790
Professor Bae Min Seong's special civil code lecture will be changed to 4 pm.

423
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,170
It'll be held in A311 classroom.

424
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,840
What do I do now?

425
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,220
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

426
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,830
Me?

427
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,890
Who are you?

428
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,230
It is me. How can you not recognize my voice?

429
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,440
Thumbs Up?

430
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,130
What number is this?

431
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,300
Ah, that?

432
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,140
I... I borrowed a handphone.

433
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,590
So, why did you call me?

434
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,400
Well, the thing is that...

435
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,670
I'm bored. If you have nothing to do, let me talk to you for a minute.

436
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,260
Are you crazy? I'm already too busy a person to deal

437
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,140
with something unimportant. Hang up!

438
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,090
Pretending to be a busy person? I got it!

439
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,970
Wait! Wait a moment! Hey!

440
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,340
- Where are you?
- Me?

441
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,470
Well, I... I am always at home.

442
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,620
You have to pay my money back, right?

443
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,630
I'll lower your debt to only half.

444
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,130
Can you come out now?

445
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,240
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.

446
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,370
The Western Union of the Korean Broadcasting Managers' Association has a general meeting for silver members so I have to attend it.

447
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,610
Silver what? Why are you always going to places like those?

448
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:03,410
This is because you don't know how important topics are discussed and decided on in these kinds of meetings.

449
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,640
Also... When you see Mal Sook's kindergarten van, please go and pick her up today.

450
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,600
Ah, right. Do you know what day it is tomorrow?

451
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,770
Pardon?

452
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:21,970
You may only know that tomorrow is the day Hyeon Jae went missing.

453
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,590
But, tomorrow is Gwang Jae's birthday.

454
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:32,390
Because his friend died on the same day as his birthday, he hasn't been able to celebrate it for 20 years so far.

455
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,000
From this year on, I want to celebrate it so I'd like you to take care of the celebration. What do you think?

456
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,000
Ah, right. I don't need your thoughts, just do what I think.

457
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,920
Make sure to prepare a birthday meal for Gwang Jae.

458
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,100
- Okay. I'll take care of it.
- Take care of what?

459
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,470
While we are at it, let me tell you this.

460
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,330
Don't you think that Gwang Jae is so pitiful going around working so hard to make a living?

461
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:08,100
If I were you, I'd have already been with Gwang Jae.

462
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,600
Anyway, make sure to celebrate his birthday tomorrow no matter what. Do you understand?

463
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,270
There is this lecture I must take but it suddenly got pulled into the afternoon.

464
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:33,100
If you cover my part-time job for me, I'll cut your debt in half. Do you understand, right?

465
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,210
In any case, she really tends to take up every and any part-time job available.

466
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,680
I guess she's trying to do every single part-time job on earth by herself.

467
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,410
Hey. I came.

468
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,170
Ah, you are here.

469
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,640
Can you really not do this kind of part-time job?

470
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,820
How do people live by doing only what they want to do?

471
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,480
Wait for a moment. I'll change my clothes first.

472
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,270
I don't really want to do this.

473
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:33,730
Then, why did you just borrow someone else's money without thinking?

474
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,730
Also, it's not from anyone. It's my money.

475
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,230
Mood Swing Inducer

476
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,810
Ah, what is it?

477
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,910
Daughter, are you really busy?

478
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,100
What is it again? I'm busy working now.

479
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,100
I'm also busy. Then I'll just make it simple.

480
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,500
You have some savings, don't you?

481
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,550
I'm about to go to jail now.

482
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,730
I'll pay you back as soon as possible, okay?

483
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,310
What on earth are you talking about? That's so out of the blue!

484
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,690
Things got twisted and a bit complicated.

485
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,860
But, if Ajussi's business goes well this time,

486
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,390
I'll definitely pay you back, even with interest.

487
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,140
Woo Seung, are you listening?

488
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,150
I'll only use it for one month—

489
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,270
If you're about to go to jail, then you can just go there.

490
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,040
Listen to you. You brat!

491
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,810
Should you talk to your mother in that way?

492
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,760
Mom, can you really call yourself a mom?

493
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,340
If you've called your daughter after a long time,

494
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,500
shouldn't you ask me if I've eaten at least?

495
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,340
Shouldn't you ask me if I'm doing well or if things are difficult for me?

496
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,040
Or if I took an exam... Did I do well or fail it?

497
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,480
Shouldn't you be wondering those things first?

498
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,590
What kind of mom are you?

499
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:55,900
♫  And tomorrow comes ♫

500
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,900
♫ Will I be closer to my dream? ♫

501
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,610
♫  Or will I be frozen like my clock? ♫

502
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:10,840
♫ Light in the sky ♫

503
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,140
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

504
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,340
♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

505
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,130
I thought you might need this.

506
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,250
♫  Some day, fly fly fly ♫

507
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,530
The Best Hit

508
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,490
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
