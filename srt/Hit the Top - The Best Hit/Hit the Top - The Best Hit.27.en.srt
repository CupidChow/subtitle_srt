The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,280
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,490
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,580
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,800
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,700
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,520
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,120
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,390
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,840
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,600
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,630
I heard you're going to debut in World Entertainment.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,100
- How did you know?
- What?

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,070
Well... I heard it from here and there.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,380
Hey, I'm also a half-time employee at World Entertainment.

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,260
Anyway, good luck.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,610
I know you'll do well.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,500
The song came out pretty great. And the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,830
I know you're Yoo Hyeon Jae.

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,110
But, I want to make one thing clear.

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,190
I only have one father and he's the CEO of World Entertainment.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,280
I hope you don't meddle with me.

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,500
We need to talk.

25
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,530
So...

26
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,820
You're really Yoo Hyeon Jae.

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,580
- Yes.
- That's strange.

28
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,120
It doesn't make any sense.

29
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,510
Isn't Yoo Hyeon Jae a person who disappeared 20 years ago?

30
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,460
But, how can that person turn up again now?

31
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,950
And what's more, he came looking the way he looked back then?

32
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,520
Does it make sense?

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,220
I know it's strange.

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,280
But, that strange thing actually happened. To me.

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,270
What do you mean?

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,440
You know, if you're playing some kind of prank again...

37
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,740
So that's why...

38
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,390
During all this time, you acted so old fashioned.

39
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,110
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,670
I should have told you sooner.

41
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,370
I know.

42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,550
I shouldn't have done it since I'm from the past.

43
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,770
You're the person Ji Hoon likes.

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,500
I don't know when it will be, but I might have to go back.

45
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,990
I shouldn't have done this from the start.

46
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,500
But I couldn't help it.

47
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,580
Because I like you.

48
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,310
So...

49
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,690
Are you going back?

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,990
I don't know.

51
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,430
Actually, I don't even know how.

52
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,100
Go back again.

53
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,500
Just go back to the world you belong to originally.

54
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,910
♫ No, no, no ♫

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,720
♫ After a long night passes ♫

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,850
♫  And tomorrow comes ♫

57
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,800
♫ Will I be closer to my dream? ♫

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,610
♫  Or will I be frozen like my clock? ♫

59
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,830
♫ Light in the sky ♫

60
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,460
♫  The sky of my youth ♫

61
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,160
Woo Seung, is something wrong?

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,120
- Pardon?
- Your face is so pale.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,650
No, it's nothing.

64
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,240
♫  Some day, fly fly fly ♫

65
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,570
We need to talk.

66
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,820
- Let's talk.
- I'm working.

67
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,970
From now on, I'm not riding in Manager Lee's car ever again!

68
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,610
I thought I was carpooling with the Grim Reaper.

69
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,950
Thanks to whom were you not late this time?

70
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,400
Don't you know that being on time for an event is crucial?

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,270
From now on, Da Bong please drive for us. I can't get in Manager Lee's car again.

72
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,380
That's right. Why are you so busy these days?

73
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,060
Can we talk?

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,010
What?

75
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,650
It's about Ji Hoon...

76
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,150
He knows I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae.

77
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,690
It's been a while.

78
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,060
I don't want to hurt him, but I don't know what to do.

79
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,360
You two should talk.

80
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,310
He doesn't even want to talk to me.

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,820
Right. Why would he?

82
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,560
He pretends to be okay, but I'm sure he must be trying his best to look that way.

83
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,660
Didn't he see his father, who he thought was dead returned,

84
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,750
the same age as he is?

85
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,160
Sometimes, I wonder why he wants to be a celebrity so desperately.

86
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,680
Sometimes, it all makes sense and I understand him.

87
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,870
His mom was a celebrity and his dad too.

88
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,080
Because his parents were celebrities, he didn't live a normal life.

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,620
Wouldn't it have been better if I came from 1994?

90
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,230
1994?

91
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:44,570
After I met Bo Hee and had Ji Hoon. If I had come here after all that,

92
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,510
I would have been happy to see Bo Hee and Ji Hoon.

93
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,100
They would have felt that way too.

94
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,700
Probably they would have if it had happened that way.

95
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,110
I didn't have anything like this in my notebook before.

96
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,930
Oh, you're here?

97
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,980
Are you getting a drink?

98
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,690
Yes. What about you?

99
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,800
Oh! Me too.

100
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,950
- Then...
- Yes.

101
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,480
I'll get going.

102
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,230
Oh, I see.

103
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,390
The Best Hit

104
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,710
Hey. Did you see that? I just did it properly.

105
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,330
Wow! This is totally awesome. (Thumbs up!)

106
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,190
No.

107
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,470
This doesn't make any sense.

108
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,010
Hey, the world has really improved. It's incredibly simple even for overseas delivery. I just bought something from overseas.

109
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,990
- What did you buy?
- A chair.

110
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,600
If it was a chair, you know I really liked that Italian chair.

111
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,000
Are you making fun of me?

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,560
So that's why I'm buying it myself this time. You must do things yourself so...

113
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,940
Anyway, the company over there is also working on your new album so you don't need to worry about anything else.

114
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,380
I'm not worried though.

115
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,300
Are you going to eat this?

116
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,490
No, you can eat it.

117
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,030
You know, our contract expires next month.

118
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,070
The company is preparing for the renewal of your contract, so you should know that to be ready.

119
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,820
Anyway, other companies won't get in touch with you.

120
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,710
You know that it's not easy for someone as popular as you to move and sign somewhere else.

121
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,180
- If you're curious, have any questions or anything you can—
- Excuse me.

122
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,220
Yes, tell me.

123
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,350
Are you going to eat that?

124
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,260
You can eat all of it. I won't be eating any of it anyway.

125
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,850
Why? What is it again?

126
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,180
CEO, you're cute when you sulk.

127
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,490
You know that if you sign with us one more time, next time you can go wherever you want when the contract expires.

128
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,450
Let's do it one last time. Understand?

129
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,360
Ah. Open your mouth.

130
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,400
You can eat it all. Eat all of it.

131
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,980
You eat so well.

132
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,280
Hey, kiddo! Are you looking after the store alone?

133
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,220
How can a child look after the store alone?

134
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,720
You're right. Why are you alone?

135
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,900
Grandpa left for a moment to do something.

136
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,260
Is that so?

137
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,730
But kiddo, why do you look so down?

138
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,800
I'm hungry.

139
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,620
What? Have you eaten yet?

140
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,080
No. I ate but I'm still hungry somehow.

141
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,390
Then you can eat with me. I haven't had dinner yet.

142
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,920
As I saw earlier, it's possible that we can make a meal out of something from the store.

143
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,830
Just wait.

144
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,040
Home dining
Okay, let me take these. Here we go.

145
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,230
It's delicious, right?

146
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,950
What happened to your friend? Did things go well for her?

147
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,020
Who?

148
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,330
You know that friend who was worried about liking her friend's guy. Your friend.

149
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,050
Ah, her. She said she felt better and more comfortable once she gave up.

150
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,690
It is not something that comes and goes at someone's will.

151
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,830
She said once she gave up, everyone was happy.

152
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,460
So, is your friend okay?

153
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,840
What can she do?

154
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,510
There's more love in the world that doesn't come true.

155
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,950
Do you think it's right to give up?

156
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,680
Giving up is something that requires courage.

157
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,420
- Who said that?
- Space Fairy Sailor.

158
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,330
Really?

159
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,390
Ahjussi, did you give up on her?

160
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,560
I'm not sure. It must be because I'm not Space Fairy Sailor.

161
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
What?

162
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,360
Why can't I give up?

163
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,620
Let's eat.

164
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,890
♫ I didn’t know love ♫

165
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,740
♫  I guess I’m still too young ♫

166
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,220
Thumbs Up
♫ Whenever I looked at you ♫

167
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,460
♫  My heart fluttered for some reason ♫

168
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,520
Thumbs Up.
♫ Your clear eyes ♫

169
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,430
♫  They were so kind ♫

170
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,890
Part-timer
♫ I couldn’t fall asleep ♫

171
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,950
♫  I could only think about you ♫

172
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,640
♫ If you ♫

173
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,770
Are you okay?

174
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,400
♫  I’ll feel like I have the world ♫

175
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,590
♫ I’m shouting to the sky ♫

176
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,560
♫  It’s only you ♫

177
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,130
♫ I’m closing my eyes, with all my heart ♫

178
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,660
Because of my personality, I'm a bad liar.

179
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,560
Then, what?

180
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,940
You look pretty.

181
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,660
I'm heavy, right?

182
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,460
You aren't light to be honest.

183
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,860
Does it hurt a lot?

184
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,380
♫ I know it took too long ♫

185
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,200
Hey, Part-timer!

186
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,950
♫  For me to figure out how I feel about you ♫

187
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,280
Thumbs Up!
♫ I wanna hold your hands ♫

188
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,780
Thumbs Up.
♫  I won’t let go of you ♫

189
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:58,300
♫ I love you, I really want you ♫

190
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,380
♫  Are you listening? ♫

191
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,430
♫ To me? ♫

192
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,580
World Entertainment

193
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:22,680
Hey. What kind of nursing home is this? Is it a hotel or what?

194
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,020
Wow! This is really expensive.

195
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,340
I'm dumbfounded.

196
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,980
Hey, what kind of place is this? It's like a camp or prison.

197
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,760
What are you doing there?

198
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,150
Ah, what? What is it?

199
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,030
What are you doing when I asked you to go to the office because we're throwing an opening party.

200
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,080
- I have to go. I was just working out.
- Working out?

201
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,550
Right.

202
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,290
Can't you see? I'm doing yoga.

203
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,560
You're a yoga master so why are you like this?

204
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,300
Since when did you say you started doing yoga?

205
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,690
Starting today. Why?

206
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,870
Come out quickly.

207
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,090
Okay.

208
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,240
Aigoo. My back.

209
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,730
What the hell is this?

210
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,270
Aigoo. My neck hurts!

211
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,360
Let's get together. Let's have an opening party even between us.

212
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,480
What party? What did you bring a cake for?

213
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,860
Why not? If this is a new business, then it's an opening.

214
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,410
I have never been out of business.

215
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,230
Everyone else believes you have.

216
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,800
Hey, hey. Anyway, you're supposed to make things as noisy as possible, don't you know?

217
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,420
Let me see. Hey, where is my seat?

218
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,880
It's here. Is it here?

219
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,020
That's my seat.

220
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,810
Hey, why is this your seat?

221
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,560
That's because now the manager is the CEO, President.

222
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,070
You little brats.

223
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:10,210
Aigoo. You have a lot of greed for this seat, you punk.

224
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,410
When will we eat the cake?

225
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,070
We're going to eat it soon. Let's sit down first.

226
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,130
I can't believe this.

227
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,330
Hey, you're back in business again, you opened the company and you'll also work as a manager.

228
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,220
But, no one is sending you even a wreath?

229
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,870
It's because I didn't tell anyone yet.

230
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,090
But still.

231
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,350
Excuse me. Where should we put this wreath?

232
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,280
Put it over there. Over there. Who sent it?

233
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,160
It says Kim Da Bong.

234
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,490
Da Bong? Hey, Da Bong sent it.

235
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,250
Ah, that punk.

236
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,300
He didn't have to.
Runny nose Gwang Jae. Enjoy it! Good luck!

237
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,950
Also, how did he know?

238
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,150
What? Who are you really calling Runny nose? You seriously!

239
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,800
- We are here.
- Hi, you came.

240
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,570
CEO, I look forward to working with you from now on.

241
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,990
I've been thinking about this for a while.

242
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:20,690
With the mood of the song and everything, why don't you two try to debut as a male duo instead of a group?

243
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,440
A duo?

244
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,790
There aren't many male duos these days, but there used to be a lot of them in the past.

245
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,860
Like Deux, Jinusean and J2. What do you think?

246
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,810
I like it.

247
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,430
It'd be better if I do a duo with Bro. I like it too.

248
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,920
Then, the name of the duo is the most important thing. Think about the name for the time being.

249
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,270
A name?

250
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,760
I'm the best at coming up with names. It's me Lee Soon Tae after all.

251
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,920
Guys, don't worry about your name.

252
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,640
I'll make a really cool name for you guys. Okay?

253
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,560
We already got a song for you so you'll start practicing dancing as soon as we find a studio.

254
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,580
- What about the choreography?
- What?

255
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,880
Ah, I'm looking into that, too.

256
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
Can I suggest some ideas?

257
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,970
Of course.

258
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,180
Hoon's Drill. What do you think about it?

259
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,970
What?

260
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,060
The rising stars.

261
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,600
With these two men, there is no wall they can't drill.

262
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,830
Lee Ji Hoon and Drill are a fantastic collaboration. They can drill walls anywhere.

263
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,370
Hoon's Drill.

264
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,260
- Think about your name.
- Yes!

265
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,800
I will think again and come up with another name.

266
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,080
♫ No, no, no ♫

267
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,220
Did you see the movie I told you about?
♫ After a long night passes ♫

268
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,320
We haven't seen it yet.

269
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,190
♫ Will I be closer to my dream? ♫

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,010
♫  Or will I be frozen like my clock? ♫

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,670
♫ Light in the sky ♫

♫ Light in the sky ♫

♫  My dreams that I always wanted ♫

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,360
♫  Some day, fly fly fly ♫

290
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,570
Seven, eight.

291
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:08,130
One, two, three, four!

292
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,870
One more time. Seven, eight!

293
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,840
One, two, three, four!

294
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,680
- One more time.
- Bro. I need some rest.

295
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,850
I think I'm too old. My joints are making noises.

296
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,610
- Should we take a break then?
- Yes.

297
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,590
There are no snack bars here.

298
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,830
Star Punch had snack bars in their building, it was better.

299
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,710
There is a convenience store near here.

300
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,890
Are you working hard?

301
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,050
Bro!

302
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,790
Hey, It's been really a long while. I'm happy to see you.

303
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,250
- What brings you here?
- I heard you started practicing.

304
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,550
So I brought you some snacks.

305
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,250
Yes! This is so refreshing.

306
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,720
How's the practice going?

307
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,160
So-so. We're working hard.

308
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,260
You can't just do it so-so.

309
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,380
If you want to make people go wild, you can't just do it so-so.

310
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,380
You have to go crazy on stage first.

311
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,630
Hey, Thumbs Up. You talk as if you had been standing on stage before.

312
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,130
Oh well, I don't remember.

313
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,860
So, I don't know.

314
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,910
Okay. I'll stop interrupting you guys and I better get going.

315
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,500
I'm going. Keep working hard.

316
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,160
Still, Thumbs Up is quite loyal.

317
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,130
- Take one.
- What?

318
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,030
- Here.
- Okay.

319
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,670
Still, just put it there. I'll help you.

320
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,200
Forget it. It's not even heavy.

321
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,500
Why don't you listen to me?

322
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,430
Aigoo.

323
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,530
Why do you keep calling me?

324
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,720
Da Bong, you're here.

325
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,000
Why are you here so late?

326
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,210
- Hey, take the girls and drive them to Dongdaemun.
- Dongdaemun?

327
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,980
I'll do it today, but I might not be able to do this anymore.

328
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,570
It's not like you've helped me a lot till now.

329
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,110
Hey. If you go to my room, there will be a schedule table on my desk.

330
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,520
The time and place for the event are included there.

331
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,760
Aigoo.

332
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,500
The schedule table...

333
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,300
Where is it?

334
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,720
Anyway, he hid it so well.

335
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,260
This Lee Gwang Jae. He's a complete idiot.

336
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,230
President. I'm going now.

337
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,610
Kiddo, I'm leaving.

338
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,520
Oh, right. You worked hard.

339
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,550
Handsome Ajussi, bye!

340
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,500
I'm Oppa.

341
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,110
Let's see.

342
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,840
Ah, I think this one is nice.

343
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,490
Mal Sook. Hooni Beanie. What do you think about it?

344
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,120
That's childish.

345
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,920
Childish?

346
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,370
This little brat. I think it sounds good. J...

347
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,710
Eureka! This is it! This is the one!

348
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,050
Grandpa. You scared me.

349
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,110
This is really awesome. Don't be surprised.

350
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,780
Grandpa, I was already surprised by you.

351
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,990
Hey. "JB". What do you think about it?

352
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,210
J stands for Lee Ji Hoon.

353
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,490
Drill's real name is Won Bin. So B stands for his name.

354
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,350
If we put them together, it makes "JB".

355
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,300
- It's awesome, right?
-Jab?

356
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,750
It's not Jab, it's JB.

357
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,980
JB sounds like Jab to me.

358
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,920
This little brat.

359
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,730
It's not jab. I said it's JB.

360
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,630
How is JB like Jab?

361
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,080
JB, Jab.

362
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,680
They sound the same to me no matter how much I hear it.

363
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,640
Ah, this little brat.

364
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,700
I can't think straight.

365
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,780
Mal Sook.

366
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:11,820
Did I ever tell you that I, your grandpa, have an IQ of around 180?

367
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,750
What?

368
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,930
Pardon? What are you talking about ?!

369
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,930
No, what do you mean you can't invest now? I only trusted Chairwoman...

370
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,440
Hello?

371
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,160
Hello?!

372
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,390
Darn it.

373
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,950
CEO Lee, I'm sorry.

374
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,920
This time around, I don't think I'll be able to invest in your business.

375
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,480
Whenever we meet, we'll talk in detail.

376
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,230
What's this? Why is everyone doing this all of a sudden?

377
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,610
How's your new home?

378
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,260
I think it's the best room I've ever lived in.

379
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,330
Is that good enough?

380
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,830
I've lived in rooftop rooms or basement rooms all the time.

381
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,350
You already know that.

382
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,510
I'm a little disappointed to hear that as your former landlord, but I'm glad to see that you're doing well at your new home.

383
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,010
Ah, I heard you started practicing again?

384
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,550
Hey. You're really debuting this time.

385
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,250
I don't know. I think I'll realize it when I go up on stage.

386
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:20,110
You're amazing. To be honest, I thought you would quit after a while.

387
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,010
Didn't you know? I'm Lee Ji Hoon when it comes to patience and persistence. Way to go! Way to go!

388
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,050
Aren't those lines originally mine?

389
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,920
If it's all about patience and persistence. In the end, Woo Seung will win!

390
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,840
You can keep it to yourself. I'm not envious or anything like that.

391
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,080
Have you seen Thumbs Up?

392
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,450
What?

393
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,060
No.

394
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,390
What about you?

395
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,300
I see his face from time to time.

396
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,170
I guess that's possible since you live together with him.

397
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,590
I have to go now. What about you?

398
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,800
Ah, I'll read some more books here.

399
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
Sure. Then study hard.

400
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,390
You too. Train hard.

401
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,630
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

402
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,570
I'm going.

403
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,990
- Hey, Choi Woo Seung.
- What?

404
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,010
Wherever you are or whatever you do, you know I'm always on your side, right?

405
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:30,050
Don't give yourself a hard time when you have a friend like me.

406
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,320
Okay.

407
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,180
I have a strange connection to this place.

408
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,920
What are you doing today?

409
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,620
Nothing much.

410
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,410
Then, let's go somewhere together.

411
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,920
What? Where?

412
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:27,090
♫ On the rainbow colored street, people smile ♫

413
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,480
No way. Why do I have to go camping with you?

414
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,970
If I order it, do as you’re told!

415
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,260
If I knew we would go this far, I wouldn't have come out.

416
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,170
We're not going far. There is no time to go that far.

417
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,300
Let's just spend one night there.

418
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,160
What?
♫ The road the leads me to you shines like sunshine ♫

419
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,550
♫ My heart is beating ♫

420
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,450
The weather is good.

421
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,900
♫ I want to confess to you today ♫

422
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,600
Hey, for this, you have to finish one side first.

423
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,550
Like this. Why isn't it working?

424
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,240
♫ Hello my love ♫

425
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,930
♫ I always looked only at you ♫

426
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,110
Are you sure you're holding it properly?

427
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,670
I'm already holding it well. I think you have to pull harder from there.

428
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,800
Is that so? To pull harder.

429
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,610
♫ I’ll call out loud for you ♫

430
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,410
What is this so complicated?

431
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,650
♫ Beautiful Beautiful ♫

432
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,940
My gosh. I don't want to do it anymore.

433
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,490
Hey, move aside.

434
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,690
I should have been more careful.

435
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,680
Get out. Hold it over there.

436
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,760
Here?

437
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,480
Yeah. Over there.

438
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,960
Hey, hey don't try too hard. I don't think it'll work out.

439
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,230
Why did Gwang Jae give me such a complicated tent?

440
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,860
It's done here.

441
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,330
The only left is the one next to you.

442
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,670
Here and it's done.

443
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,130
♫ So that you can hear ♫

444
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,420
♫ Beautiful ♫

445
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,820
What should we do?

446
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,400
- Do you want to eat?
- Already?

447
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,520
It's hard to eat when the sun sets.

448
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,890
Okay, let's do that. Then, what about the portable stove?

449
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,550
I brought the portable stove...

450
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,240
And I packed the pots and pans too. Just trust me.

451
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,420
I'm great at making preparations and getting things ready.

452
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:23,470
What's this? Why did you bring a drill here? The drill of all things?

453
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,470
I thought this was the portable stove.

454
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,060
Why is there a drill here?

455
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,150
Hey, you should've looked inside it beforehand.

456
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,130
Hey, what are you going to cook with this drill?

457
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,230
Do you think I brought this on purpose, knowing it's a drill?

458
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,760
You brought a useless drill.

459
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,510
Who's been talking behind my back and swearing at me for this long?

460
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,950
You're not supposed to even touch dogs when they eat.

461
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,180
Hey, hey forget about it. There is a convenience store I saw on the way.

462
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,460
So let's buy something simple there and eat it.

463
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,340
- Should we do that?
- Yes.

464
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,340
Let's go.

465
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,980
Aigoo.

466
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,770
Why did you bring a drill of all things?

467
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,880
The Best Hit

468
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,410
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
