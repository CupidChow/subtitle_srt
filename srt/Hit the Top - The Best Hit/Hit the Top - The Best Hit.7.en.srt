1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,610
The Best Hit

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,590
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,390
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,730
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,130
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,350
Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,840
Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,780
Kim Min Jae
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,100
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,300
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,070
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,850
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,560
What's that? Where is that sound coming from?

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,170
I've clearly heard that beepers no longer exists.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,160
How come?

16
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,610
The number you dialed doesn't exist.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,800
What's this 22198?

18
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,600
- Fighting!
- Hey, you...

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,310
Fighting! Fighting!

20
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,520
I, Choi Woo Seung, will win the game in the end.

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,500
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,000
I was feeling so horrible before, but I feel better now.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,260
In the battle against myself...

24
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,480
Should I say I won?

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,290
I see.

26
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,210
If you won the battle against yourself, that means you lost.

27
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,190
Don't do the math. I'm just saying.

28
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,730
Anyway, I missed the bus so it left. I'll just try to think positive.

29
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,520
The recovery is pretty fast. That's good.

30
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,120
That's that. It's time for me to have a settlement again. I'll have to do it, right?

31
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,710
Settle? What settlement?

32
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,200
Freedom

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,240
What's that? This chocolate bar has been more than 20 years.

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,560
Where did you get this?

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,440
There is someone who got this for me.

36
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,810
What's up with her again? Take her away!

37
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,760
Hey, Woo Seung. Hey, you're going to hurt someone.

38
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,890
Hey, take her away.

39
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,650
Oh, I have a pain in the back of my head.

40
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,220
You often use that to hit people. That's called attempted murder.

41
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,050
That's right. You can certainly hurt someone.

42
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,820
See who's talking? You've committed attempted murder by giving me a bar that's more than 20 years old!

43
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,490
Indeed, that's your fault.

44
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,440
- What about me? Did I know that?
- Yeah. Why could he do it on purpose?

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,670
You didn't know, and that's it?

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,620
I screwed the exam which I've been preparing for, for a year because of that bar I ate.

47
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,540
How are you going to be responsible for this?!

48
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,950
That's right. You don't know how much Woo Seung prepared for that exam.

49
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,410
I also ate so many of those chocolate bars, but look at me. I have no issues.

50
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,380
- You're right. How come you're fine?
- Why are you siding with both of us?

51
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,770
- Whose side are you on?
- There is nothing to side over.

52
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,550
Anyway, isn't going to the bathroom a basic thing to do before the exam?

53
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,390
This would not have happened if you prepared for it the right way. Don't you think?

54
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,270
What are you talking about at this timing?!

55
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,800
Please be quiet.

56
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,720
Hey, Drill! Come on!

57
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,550
He doesn't seem to be breathing.

58
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,630
Why don't you try to give him CPR?

59
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,180
- Why do you look at me?
- He was hit by you, so you should.

60
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,860
Just let him die.

61
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,510
Ah, really. Why did I ever set foot in this hellish room?

62
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,100
The Best Hit
Drill, Drill! Is he dead?

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,030
Take your time. Mal Sook. No one's chasing you.

64
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,200
I've been thinking I may have been a monk in my previous life.

65
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,610
What? Monk? Why?

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,130
I love meat so much. Isn't it because I couldn't have meats in my previous life?

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,770
- How can you have such greasy food this early in the morning?
- I can have anything.

68
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,840
Okay, enjoy it a lot.

69
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,540
What's up? Are you counting rice?

70
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,640
Me? I'm eating fine.

71
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,470
- What's up with him?
- Aigoo. Since yesterday, he's been talking about Hyeon...

72
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,060
He has been seeing something like ghosts lately.

73
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,040
You should cut down on the alcohol. You have to think about your age.

74
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,610
You shouldn't drink as much as you used to. What should we do?

75
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,670
It's not because of the alcohol.

76
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,930
What's up with my age? I'm Lee Soon Tae, Lee Soon Tae.

77
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,720
I've come this far thanks to my strength and guts. That's me, Lee Soon Tae.

78
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,630
By the way, something weird happened to me on the rooftop.

79
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,630
On the rooftop? What happened?

80
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:53,500
I've experienced it several times. Someone other than Oppa must be living on the rooftop.

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,640
Without anyone knowing.

82
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,190
Mom!

83
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,850
- Hey!
- Hey! You startled us!

84
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,240
Why are you so surprised all of a sudden?

85
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,700
A person? Someone else is living there?

86
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,650
Who else would live there other than me?

87
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,070
That's right. Why are you all reacting seriously to a child's comment?

88
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,750
That's not the case. It's real.

89
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,700
You said that beepers don't work these days, right?

90
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,940
Bro. Beeper service has come to an end. Handphones are even being used in hospitals.

91
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,960
Where on earth did you find such an obsolete thing?

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,490
- But, why did it ring?
- How would I know?

93
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:42,060
No, maybe it was sad just like me.

94
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,180
- Ah. Are you both going out?
- Yes.

95
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,710
But you both failed. Why do you two even bother?

96
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,430
- Bro.
- You, really!

97
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,410
No. I think you two are working too hard uselessly.

98
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,010
Are you supposed to go to the academy?

99
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,110
Right. What do I do then?

100
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,950
What about you? Are you going to the company?

101
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,930
What else should I do? I have to go.

102
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,900
By the way, how did Ji Hoon do on his monthly evaluation?

103
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,410
Bro will be confirmed for a debut team for sure.

104
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,420
- Really?
- Yes.

105
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,540
I didn't really cry when I joined the army.

106
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,810
Wow! But when I heard his rap yesterday, it almost made me cry. Oh.

107
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,080
Army? Did you go to the army?

108
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,290
No. I imagined I was going.

109
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,130
To the army.

110
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, I'm late. I should go to congratulate Ji Hoon. I'm going.

111
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,940
Good for you, Lee Ji Hoon.

112
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,700
Oh, well. He's the best one out of the three of us.

113
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,780
Yo, Bro! What's up?

114
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:20,440
- Are you okay now?
- Hey, Bro. I'm MC Drill.

115
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,270
Failure makes me stronger.

116
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,770
I can see you've been very positive about yourself.

117
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,000
Bro. No, singer Lee.

118
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,300
Even if you make it big, don't forget me.

119
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,030
First, wait for me in the debut team. I'll follow you there soon.

120
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,740
- They even haven't announced it yet. Don't make a fuss.
- I don't want to!

121
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,430
Okay, everyone. Attention.

122
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,220
Hello!

123
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,680
I know everyone's going through a lot working hard.

124
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,680
Before your class starts, I have an announcement to make.

125
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,010
As you may have already heard about this, we're launching a new male idol group in the company.

126
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,140
From now on, if your name gets called, please go to practice room 201. You're in the debut team.

127
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,890
Drill.

128
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,890
Oh my gosh!

129
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,310
God, thank you! Thank you!

130
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,630
Hey!

131
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,770
Take your headphones off, you punk! This rascal. I'm about to make an official announcement, show some respect.

132
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,980
- Dong Hyeok!
- Yes!

133
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,920
- Dong Wook!
- Yes!

134
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,440
- Joon Seok!
- Yes!

135
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,110
- Dong Gyoo!
- Yes!

136
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,050
Also...

137
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,840
- Kevin.
- Yes!

138
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,530
Okay. These five people are part of the debut group.

139
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,910
The people who got called, pack your stuff and gather in practice room 201 now.

140
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,700
Goodbye.

141
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,270
No. Why is your name not included?

142
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,090
Something must be wrong. Don't you think so?

143
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,530
Bro. You rapped so well yesterday. How can they miss your name?

144
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:39,070
- Something definitely went wrong—
- Please stop already.

145
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,150
Why were you overreacting before?

146
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,140
Bro.

147
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,740
Oh, hey!

148
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,920
- Hey, what was that?
- Weren't you trying to kill yourself?

149
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,640
Who's going to die?

150
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,800
I heard you were dropped out of the debut group.

151
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,840
So that's why I thought you were trying to kill yourself. You weren't'?

152
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,640
Stop acting up.

153
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,270
You have to live to debut and become a star? So you should live too.

154
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,010
Is that supposed to be called consolation?

155
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,840
Funny. Why would I comfort you?

156
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,860
You either weren't prepared well or you weren't good enough to make it to the debut team,

157
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,140
so the more prepared and talented kids got selected instead.

158
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,380
But then who comforts who?

159
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,770
I don't tend to waste my energy on something like that.

160
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,070
Hey! Old student!

161
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,430
I have to admit that you were cool yesterday.

162
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,250
A little bit.

163
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,840
Gwang Jae!

164
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,410
While you are here, please watch the store for a while.

165
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,140
Why are you ordering me around as soon as I get here?

166
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,290
Oh my gosh! What do you mean ordering you around? I actually asked you to help me.

167
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,790
You always have a problem with the way you talk.

168
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,480
When you ask others to do something for you, you should explain it politely.

169
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,900
And then ask them if they could help you.

170
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,230
I would like to relax by doing yoga. Anyway, you have nothing to do in your empty office.

171
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:35,190
If you don't make a big deal of it while you're here, I'd like to ask you to look after the store for a while.

172
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,020
Then...

173
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,920
But, why does it make me feel more upset?

174
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,310
Aigoo. I should have died earlier so that I didn't have to see that guy the other night.

175
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,250
Ah, I take it back. I cancel that statement. I take it back!

176
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,570
Early stages of dementia should be treated properly

177
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,990
What? This can't be possible.

178
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,940
I'm still young, but what dementia I have?

179
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,720
But I want to keep reading it.

180
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,220
Fishing, hiking, swimming, nuts, and yoga is good for your health.

181
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,440
Hey, hey, hey. That's not the feeling I'm looking for.

182
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,670
I mixed a future bass style similar to the Chainsmokers with hip-hop. You don't like it?

183
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,910
The Chains... What?

184
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,300
If you don't like this, I can mix popular trap beats with dubstep.

185
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,500
I don't care about the trap beats or whatever as long as it sounds like this.

186
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,200
Ah, If I boost up the lower frequencies a little bit—

187
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,510
I don't care what you boost up. So when it starts it should be like this...

188
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,300
A feeling like that.

189
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,400
I'm not even asking you to create a new one, but is it so hard to ask you to get the feeling right?

190
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,800
So exactly which part do you not like at all?

191
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,700
Listen.

192
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,480
A feeling like that. You don't get it?

193
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,680
Let's do a good job this time, Cary.

194
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,770
Is that hard to just add more space to the melody line I already gave you?

195
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,630
Okay, I understand.

196
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,940
Is that hard to do that? Ah, really!

197
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,270
- Ah, you scared me!
- Oops!

198
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,240
Who are you?

199
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,280
I didn't even hear you coming in. How did you do it so quietly?

200
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,720
How did you... What?

201
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,680
Hey, hey... Secretary Choi.
I was just doing my job.

202
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,830
Who is this strange man here?
 I don't understand!

203
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,170
Ah, I forgot to tell you about it. That man is David who came to fix the chair.

204
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,240
Is he still there?

205
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,240
Hey. Throw this chair away! Throw it away!

206
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,210
I don't understand! I was just doing my job! I don't understand why!

207
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,420
CEO. I completely fixed it.

208
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,960
- I already fixed your chair. I fixed it!
- Did you speak Korean?

209
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,860
What's wrong with everyone these days?

210
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,940
Aigoo. I practically gave him all the songs complete. What does he do as a producer?

211
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,540
Do I need to do everything and even explain it to him?

212
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,840
- Did anyone come into my office when I wasn't here?
- The repairman.

213
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,460
- Not him.
- Then nobody else.

214
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,380
Then, who did this here?

215
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,450
I want this, a handphone. I'll have it someday.

216
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,180
Boring. So boring.

217
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,510
This thing doesn't get WiFi.

218
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,440
Nobody is paging me anymore.

219
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,730
Even if I get a message, there is no way I can even check it.

220
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,800
This was the best place.

221
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,060
The missing Yoo Hyeon Jae's car has been found empty by the Lake Suryeon.

222
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,320
Lake Suryeon.

223
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,190
Where on earth is that place?

224
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,790
I might remember something if I go there.

225
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,500
Hey. I have no money on me. How could I even go there?

226
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,940
Where did my money go? That would be quite a lot of money even these days.

227
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm sure all of my emergency money is gone.

228
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,570
Perhaps, could it still be there?

229
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,040
Ah. Here it is.

230
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,430
I'm sure some of it is hidden here. Please. Please.

231
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,740
Yes!

232
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,930
This is super awesome. The Best! Thumbs up!

233
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,270
Yes. Yes, here you are.

234
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,830
Thank you, goodbye.

235
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,960
What else is this anchovy guy trying to do now by calling me?

236
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,290
Yes, Director.

237
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,260
Oh, it's me.

238
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,800
You didn't get upset that day, right?

239
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,970
No. I didn't think we're close enough, so what are we supposed to be upset about?

240
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,310
In any case, CEO Lee how can you be so narrow-minded when you're in such big trouble?

241
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,790
I'm so narrow-minded that I don't have to do much to be in trouble so often.

242
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,190
Let's go with Hong Bo Hee.

243
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,130
Go where? What?

244
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,030
I've been feeling bad about you ever since I saw you.

245
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,500
So that's why I'm giving you this big opportunity to let her come on the show.

246
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,680
Director! No, Hyung. I'm really thankful.

247
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,200
Yes! Then, will she be on "Burning Youth" show?

248
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,080
No. She won't be on "Burning Youth" show. She'll be on a show called "Challenge Music Star ."

249
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,190
It's popular. A lot of people watch that, too.

250
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,100
The shooting schedule is a bit tight so we are in a hurry. If her schedule is fine—

251
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,000
Director! Really, I will never forget what you just did for me.

252
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,840
Come on. Are you that gIad? Okay, I got it. Good luck then.

253
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,990
- What did he say? Would she do it?
- Of course. I even called him.

254
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,030
But, is Bo Hee really the talk of the town lately?

255
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,490
After she came out on a radio show, she got famous and popular as The Idiot Lady among kids lately.

256
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,030
The Idiot Lady?

257
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,810
I don't know what you're talking about. Anyway, I got her for you.

258
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,630
By the way, how can Yeon Son Ah's appendix burst right before shooting the show?

259
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,310
Back in the old days, we used to keep shooting a show even if someone's appendix burst.

260
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,380
That's why we have two appendices.

261
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,800
But still, that man seems to have some conscience.

262
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,820
So what's "Challenge Music Star"?

263
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,050
Ah. I looked into it. It is a very popular program.

264
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:46,030
Singers come out and sing random songs from a karaoke machine. If you know a lot of songs, you can win.

265
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,190
Win?

266
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,020
Hey. If I win, I'm going out on that next week, too?

267
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,530
Right. If you win, you have to go out again for sure.

268
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,090
Let's just keep winning on the show so that you can become a regular member. Regular cast.

269
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,600
Now then, should we practice?

270
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,760
What practice? I don't need to practice. I will just have to do my very best.

271
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,530
That's right. Well, just do the best you can. You already know a lot of songs.

272
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,680
I need at least three thousand dollars for a deposit to move out.

273
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,510
Ah. I can't do anything since I don't have any money.

274
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,560
I can only go to the academy as Ji Hoon until this month.

275
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,550
If I want to sign up for a place at the academy, I have to pay starting next month.

276
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,370
There is no solution. No solution at all.

277
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,300
♫ Come back. Come back to me ♫

278
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:47,460
♫  All I can think of is you ♫

279
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,430
♫ My love like fire cannot be avoided ♫

280
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,870
I got it wrong again.

281
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,010
Oh, my goodness.

282
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,340
Are you coming home now?

283
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,210
I had my part-time job today.

284
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,400
Welcome, Ji Hoon.

285
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,710
That was out of the blue. What was that?

286
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,370
I can tell you're not part of the debut group. No?

287
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,080
Anyway, you noticed it.

288
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,640
You're right. I failed.

289
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,730
Welcome to Loser World.

290
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:40,500
I welcome you to the world of losers which is filled with disappointments and frustrations.

291
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,210
You can't welcome me. I've been in that world all the time.

292
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,380
Hey. I'd rather be happy. This is for the best.

293
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,780
Stop wasting all your money. I would rather study and go make some money.

294
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,630
You're talented when it comes to studying.

295
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,250
Honestly, I don't know. Things just don't work out the way I want them to.

296
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,490
If I think about my parents, it's right to give up.

297
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,050
My poor heart goes back and forth several times a day.

298
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,530
What's so complicated about it?

299
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,310
Hey, it's been a long while. Let's ride that.

300
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,380
Anyway, there's not a single serious bone in your body.

301
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,280
Let's get on.

302
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,630
- Okay, I'm spinning it.
- Hey, hey.

303
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,850
Ah, I am really not good at things like this.

304
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,450
How is it? It's absolutely fun, right?

305
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,300
What fun? I'm really dizzy now.

306
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,080
So that's why you should keep yourself well-balanced.

307
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,200
Even if the world might seem to be shaking, you're actually the one shaking.

308
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
I know you're making excuses because you're not confident.

309
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,700
Woo Seung.

310
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,200
Why are you here?

311
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,450
I get the best WiFi signal here in this room.

312
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,700
Still, the owner of this room isn't here. Anyway, this is a girl's room.

313
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,640
So what? What's with that? It's an honor to have a celebrity like me staying here.

314
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,500
A celebrity?

315
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,150
What do you remember?

316
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,380
No. It's not like I remember something.

317
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,980
Anyway, please tell me if you remember.

318
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,970
Okay. If I remember anything, I'll tell you first.

319
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,040
Oh, you startled me.

320
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,840
What's going on? Why are you in a room without its owner?

321
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,410
I came to give this back. This is the one I borrowed last time.

322
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,540
You already made yourself at home here?

323
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,260
- Aren't you leaving?
- Hey!

324
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,210
Oh, please just a little bit. This is the only place with a good Wi-Fi signal.

325
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,330
Leave before I do something to you.

326
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,650
Hey, by any chance do you know where Lake Suryeon is?

327
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,480
Suryeon? What is that?

328
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,640
- It's Lake Suryeon.
- I don't know.

329
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,620
Aren't you leaving soon?

330
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,160
I see you really only learn to get your act together after you get beaten up.

331
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,110
I'll cause you a nosebleed.

332
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,000
Do you need money?

333
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,450
Where on earth is there a person who doesn't need money?

334
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,310
I'll repay you all the money I owe you today.

335
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,380
- Follow me.
- Where to?

336
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,490
Yoori Bank

337
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,200
What's wrong? Why is it closed?

338
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,330
Are you kidding me? Today is Saturday!

339
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,310
So why is it closed when it's Saturday?

340
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,640
- It's closed because it's Saturday!
- What?

341
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,340
Hey, banks aren't open on Saturdays?

342
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,080
I'm stupid, an idiot and a fool who just trusted you and followed you all the way here!

343
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,440
Stop with your self-introduction. Hey, part-timer. Do a part-time job for me.

344
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,660
What part-time job?

345
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,000
Lake Suryeon, Paju, Gyeonggi-do.

346
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,180
Please take me there.

347
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,270
Do you think I'm your taxi driver? Where on earth is this?

348
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,440
Hey, do you think I'm that easy?

349
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,210
- This.
- What about that?

350
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,920
What is this?

351
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,610
One million won? Where did you get all this money? You...

352
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,920
Do you notice my greatness now?

353
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,960
- Did you steal it?!
- What? Ah, really. What do you take me for?

354
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,520
Whatever. When the bank is open on Monday, I'll pay you twice the amount of your part-time job.

355
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,600
So please take me there.

356
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,870
How can I trust you will pay me?

357
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,310
Read it now.

358
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:07,570
If I don't pay back Choi Woo Seung her money by Monday, I'll move out of the rooftop without any complaints.

359
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,840
Are you satisfied? Is it enough?

360
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,420
Okay!

361
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,930
What? What are you looking at?

362
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,500
I remember something.

363
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,780
Do you remember? What is it?

364
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,330
I... I hated someone like you the most.

365
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,850
I just remembered that. That's it.

366
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,090
Anyway, you'll have to keep the promise!

367
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,650
Are you guys are going somewhere or something?

368
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,970
If you were going to do this, you would have come to my car instead of Bohee's.

369
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,510
Don't you think I have to follow you to save your face? That's why I'm coming on board.

370
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,110
You need someone to help Bo Hee with her fashion style and do her makeup.

371
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,840
We'll impress the directors as well as the producers while we are around.

372
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,620
But still, you can't just follow us like this.

373
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,880
Hey, do we still have some time left?

374
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,400
If there's a lottery store on the way, please stop in front of it.

375
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,940
- Lottery tickets?
- Yes.

376
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,370
Hey, I had a dream last night.

377
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,330
It was a huge dragon breathing fire from its mouth.

378
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,140
Ah. I thought this might be what people call a lucky dream. I might win first place.

379
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,490
- President, did you dream of a dragon?
- That's right.

380
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,230
Was there a dog riding on the dragon?

381
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,060
Hey, what are you saying such unlucky things for?

382
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,170
Anyway, stop in front of the lottery store.

383
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,160
We don't have time to stop by a lottery store...

384
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,460
That dream...

385
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,070
- Sell it to me.
- What?

386
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,320
That dragon dream.

387
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,080
Please sell it to me.

388
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,110
Ah, it's too good to sell it.

389
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,470
You just sold it to me, right?

390
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,870
Okay, then. Take my lucky dream.

391
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:01,250
Hey! Today, I guess Bo Hee will be filming a legendary show.

392
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,720
If you guys do well and things work out for the best, it'll be thanks to me.

393
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,630
How many lines are there?

394
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,270
There is even a Line 9? What's the airport railroad?

395
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,970
Here. This is the subway ticket.

396
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,330
Is this a subway ticket?

397
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,460
This is ultimately superb!

398
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,830
Hey! You're embarrassing me. Stop that tacky old-fashioned reaction. What ultimately superb?

399
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,780
No ultimately superb?

400
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,070
Then... Thumbs up!

401
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,450
Stop that also.

402
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,530
What people use words like "thumbs up" these days?

403
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,460
- People don't use "thumbs up" these days either?
- No.

404
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,510
I've never seen anyone using those words. You're the first person to have said those out loud.

405
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,120
Well... I won't use "ultimately superb" anymore.

406
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,430
Also, please do something about that too. Your belt is hanging down like a snake.

407
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,950
You have no idea how trendy this is.

408
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,220
Hey, hey. Forget it. Whatever.

409
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,960
I shouldn't talk about fashion with you.

410
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,540
Right. Let's go quietly.

411
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,700
Let's make it as if we're going together, but we're actually going separately!

412
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,040
Anyway, she's rough.

413
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,450
What are you talking about? It's hard to even see her bare face, it is so terrible.

414
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,210
She's so overweight with big glasses and even bad skin.

415
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,790
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

416
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,070
Yes. As soon as she uploads and posts a selfie on her social media on the Internet, she'll instantly delete it.

417
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,900
I felt so sorry for her. To be honest, she's not even close to us. She's a complete nobody.

418
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,090
Hey. She shouldn't be so oblivious. She must consider her surroundings! She should join in when it’s appropriate and leave when it’s not.

419
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,970
I have so much more to talk about her, but let's just stop here.

420
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,370
Whatever. Let's just not even care.

421
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,270
We're living in a complex world. Let's take our minds off of our worries!

422
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,840
What the heck was that? Was that even Korean?

423
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,000
Ah, you startled me all of a sudden.

424
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,780
I told you to stay right next to me and not get distracted.

425
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,590
I wasn't distracted.

426
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:40,410
♫ The stars floating in the night sky twinkle even more today ♫

427
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,940
Oh pretty. Pretty. That's enough! It's perfect. Perfect.

428
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,790
It is good, I like it. It's so pretty. It's great. Great!

429
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,960
Where do you keep going? You're adding to the chaos.

430
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,230
Hey. Maybe it's because I'm quite nervous, but I went to the bathroom five times already.

431
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,080
No. It's because you're eating so many nuts lately. It's oily, so no wonder.

432
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,330
You've never touched those in your life. Why are you eating so much today?

433
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,620
So what? It's because I have my reason, you punk.

434
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,730
Oh! Hello, CEO Lee.

435
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,040
Ah. Writer Lee.

436
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,340
It's been a long time.

437
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,920
Why are you getting prettier every time I see you?

438
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,190
Hey. I'm a mess right now.

439
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,420
Anyway, thank you for the compliment.

440
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,370
Ah! Hello, Bo Hee. Nice to meet you for the first time.

441
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,800
- You're so pretty.
- Thank you.

442
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,210
Do you know the program concept?

443
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,230
- Excuse me, Writer.
-Yes.

444
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,970
I don't think you know since you must be a rookie writer.

445
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,170
I am Chairman Lee Soon Tae of Korea's Managing Association.

446
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,940
She's not a rookie, she's the main writer.

447
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,100
Main? Why is a main writer so young?

448
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,680
That must be why. Have you ever heard of J2?

449
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,660
I raised them. You never heard of CEO Lee Soon Tae of World Entertainment?

450
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,910
- Sorry? Oh, yes.
- Yes, my foot.

451
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,080
Bo Hee, your special talent today is yoga, right?

452
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,290
- Oh, yes.
- Do you by any chance have anything else?

453
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,540
Anything else?

454
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:19,630
For instance, there's a contestant today who can do a headstand using a tennis racket.

455
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,130
Another one can play the recorder with his feet.

456
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:29,010
Hey, that's hilarious. He does it with his feet?

457
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:34,480
To be honest, the more exciting talents are more likely to be broadcast, so I was just wondering.

458
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,800
Well, Bo Hee's yoga is outstanding.

459
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,100
We'll work very hard to make sure she gets her screen time.

460
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,800
- Oh! She's really good at cross-stitching.
- She also has a high tolerance for alcohol!

461
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:54,070
Then, we'll stick with yoga. Please wait on standby!

462
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,530
You'll get your screen time if you do yoga really well. Don't worry about it.

463
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,180
Wait. Writer!

464
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,420
- I'll give you exactly ten minutes.
- Okay.

465
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:39,230
- What?
- I'm giving you ten minutes, so hurry up and look around.

466
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:46,170
Hey, part-timer, you came here as a part-timer, but why is it all up to you? You're even calling the shots?

467
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,510
- If you have a problem with that, come alone next time.
- Wow, I can't believe this. You're so snobby.

468
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,180
Ugh, whatever.

469
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,340
We have discovered the last known location of popular singer Yoo Hyeon Jae!

470
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,470
One month after his disappearance, yesterday afternoon at a lake in Paju,

471
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,860
Yoo Hyeon Jae's car was found.

472
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:34,930
While 1994 was the past, it's still the future to me.

473
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:39,160
But, why on earth did I even come here?

474
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:46,610
In 1994, I went missing here and disappeared from the world.

475
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,700
Why here? Why did I disappear?

476
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:58,770
Or, is it that I didn't disappear, someone forced me to disappear?

477
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,500
I came here with the worst person ever. That dude is really the worst.

478
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,940
but it's so nice to be out after so long!

479
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:43,690
Should I send the suffering trainee a picture of the beautiful Mother Nature?

480
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,970
What do I do?

481
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,880
I will wait for you forever.

482
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,750
Is Bo Hee... Hong Bo Hee?

483
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,730
Hey! Thumbs up! Thumbs up!

484
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,170
Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Thumbs up!

485
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,870
Thumbs up! help me! Thumbs up!

486
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,700
That stupid...

487
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,130
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, pretty much.

488
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,880
You're completely soaked! Is it really okay?

489
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,980
I said I am.

490
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,320
Not you, the handphone!

491
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,750
- What?
- I put my handphone in your bag earlier.

492
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,300
Oh, here it is.

493
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,880
Wow, I almost got a heart attack. You should be more careful next time.

494
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,230
Hey! You dare value a handphone more than a human's life?

495
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,980
A human just fell into the water!

496
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,970
So what? You're clearly fine at first glance.

497
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,290
This little...

498
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,280
Why?

499
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,600
Ugh, I think my contact lens fell out.

500
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,390
What? Contact lens?

501
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,470
What do I do?

502
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,340
I can't see anything without them.

503
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,010
- Do you understand now?
- Understand what?

504
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:14,820
The importance of my belt, which you always made fun of for being tacky. Do you respect it now?

505
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,850
Stop saying useless things and don't get us lost.

506
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,100
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,220
The Best Hit

508
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,730
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫
