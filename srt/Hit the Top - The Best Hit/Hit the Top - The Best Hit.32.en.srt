The Best Hit

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,400
♫ The stars floating in the night sky ♫

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,430
♫ Twinkle even more today ♫

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,580
♫ Like your eyes, like your lips ♫

♫ They make my heart flutter  ♫

Yoon Si Yoon 
♫ Beautiful day  ♫

Lee Se Young 
♫ And I have something to say ♫

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,580
Kim Min Jae 
♫ Something to tell ♫

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,080
Cha Tae Hyun 
♫ I wanna shout out your name to the sky ♫

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,310
♫ I’ll tell you ♫

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,050
♫ I love you ♫

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,410
♫ It’s a beautiful day ♫

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,540
Thumbs Up. I'm here.

14
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,710
What is going on?

15
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,830
Dad said it would probably be useful for you to consult this.

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,000
What is this?

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,830
He must have known that you're studying composition.

18
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,110
He said they're documents related to composition that he has been gathering since long ago.

19
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,100
He also said there is also the composition notebook of a famous singer, in there.

20
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,230
Was he always such a delicate person, the president?

21
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,390
Us, father and son are like this. We pretend not to be, but we're delicate.

22
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,260
I know that President is like this, but you, I'm not sure.

23
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,670
Right. I had my first broadcast today.

24
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,960
I know.

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,610
I was so busy all day working on your press release.

26
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,020
The reaction at the site was good, and we got complimented by the director.

27
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,930
You're amazing, Lee Ji Hoon.

28
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,090
You were eating?

29
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,040
Do you want to eat together? I made plenty.

30
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,970
No, I ate before coming. And I have to leave right away.

31
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,470
To practice?

32
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,680
It's an opportunity that was difficult to obtain, and I want to be able to say I did my best, no matter whether it works out or not.

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,420
Wow, you grew up a lot!

34
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,210
Continue eating. I'm going to leave now.

35
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,640
Okay.

36
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,890
Go safely.

37
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,990
You did well, Lee Ji Hoon.

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,410
You did well if you stopped.

39
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,180
♫ I’m dreaming again ♫

40
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,490
♫ The dream I wanted ♫

41
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,610
♫  I pray with my hands together ♫

42
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,010
♫  Sometimes ♫

43
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,170
Thumbs Up.

44
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:15,430
Are you eating?

45
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,610
It must be night over there as well.

46
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,720
♫  I have a dream  ♫

47
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,070
♫ I have a dream ♫

48
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,520
♫ I have a dream ♫

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Welcome...

50
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,860
What are you doing here?

51
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,420
Why would I come to a bakery? To buy bread, of course.

52
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,670
Pick out a cake that isn't too sweet.

53
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,090
Here. Take this one.

54
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,410
Oh, is this good?

55
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,530
This is the most expensive one. You have a lot of money!

56
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,240
Who's the one who took our company's ace?

57
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,780
We received a tremendously serious blow, you see?

58
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,890
So you should've been good to him while he was there.

59
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,200
Oh? Yeong Jae!

60
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,270
Oh, Bo Hee. It's been a while.

61
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,400
You should come more often. Our bakery's bread is really delicious.

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,620
Oh, oh, I should.

63
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,800
Hey, there, pack some different kinds of bread.

64
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,020
Hey. You're supposed to go over there and choose for yourself.

65
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,860
Oh, is that so?

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,040
Gwang Jae treats you well, right? If he makes any mistake, contact me right away. I won't hold back.

67
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,600
Who are you to say that?

68
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,980
I'm like a good neighbor.

69
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,880
Neighbor, what crap are you saying again.

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,620
Here.

71
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,400
- What's that?
- Service.

72
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,640
Ah right. I'll be using your recording room a bit.

73
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,300
I've looked into recording rooms around here but they're always booked. Just for a while.

74
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,930
Well, that request was so bold.

75
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,530
We'll see. You didn't even give an envelope.

76
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,930
- Leave.
- Bye!

77
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,760
Get along with Yeong Jae.

78
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,240
He might be a little prickly, but inside he's not like that.

79
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,140
What do you mean, get along with him?

80
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,360
Just this much is perfectly good with Yeong Jae.

81
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,470
5 year-old Ji Hoon. How can a boy be this pretty?

82
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,510
Oh my, oh my. I'm so tired.

83
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,020
This... can you put it in ice cream?

84
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,520
It's for my proposal. I ask this of you.

85
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,260
I'm usually very good at this kind of thing.

86
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,690
Ah.

87
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,990
This is so good!

88
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,540
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

89
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,850
Ah, it's nothing, it's nothing. Eat, eat.

90
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,170
Eat it, it's good.

91
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,060
- I...
- Why, why?

92
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,960
Why are you acting like that?

93
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,970
I... think I'll have to go to the hospital.

94
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,460
What? The hospital?

95
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,960
Why did you swallow something like this? It could've been really bad.

96
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,900
Well, after a day or two, it'll come out naturally. You see it, right?

97
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,270
Isn't that... a ring?

98
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,940
Please give me a moment.

99
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,750
I've swallowed these words for twenty years.

100
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,990
After swallowing them so much, I also ended up swallowing the ring.

101
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,160
Although I'm nothing, I'll make you happy.

102
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,070
Marry me.

103
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:27,240
Thank you. And my response...

104
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,790
is yes.

105
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,030
Congratulations.

106
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,330
I hope it comes out by tonight.

107
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,330
Should we have done a proper ceremony, as well?

108
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,080
Later, slowly.

109
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,040
No, but Mal Sook is also on our family register now.

110
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,090
Now we're a proper family.

111
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,320
Ah really, you're so impatient.

112
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,280
Should I look into it?

113
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,990
For my wedding, I want to do it properly.

114
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,810
Renting the biggest wedding hall in the biggest hotel.

115
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,220
Is that so? Then, let's go slowly.

116
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,580
Let's do it slowly. Your new agency job is the most important now.

117
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,590
Also, stop coming down to the bakery.

118
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,760
But that is—

119
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,340
The president should guard the office. Don't you agree?

120
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,250
Is that so?

121
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,250
Ah, about your album. I'm in the middle of looking into it.

122
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,780
This time, I even made a proper company. I'll support you firmly.

123
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,090
No, do that slowly, too.

124
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,530
What?

125
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,900
I want to be a good mother and a good wife first.

126
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,800
After that, if I still feel regretful, then I'll tell you.

127
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,470
But when that happens, you have to push me properly, okay?

128
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,640
Okay. Just tell me when you're ready anytime.

129
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,980
Thumbs Up!

130
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,870

131
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,020

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,780
Why aren't you coming?

136
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,110
Have you forgotten me already?

137
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:05,020
Thank you to our English moderators: marykarmelina, pilar_velasquez and lazarini and our other language moderators.

138

It should be possible on Friday at eleven.

139
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,670
The location is ... Ah, Sangam?

140
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,280
Yes, I know that place.

141
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,310
Then how do you proceed with the pre-interview?

142
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,290
Your Americano is done!

143
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,770
Yes, I understand.

144
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,780

00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:01,100
♫ I love you, I really want you ♫

161
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,710
♫  Are you listening? ♫

162
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,470
♫ I know it took too long ♫

163
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:15,740
♫  For me to figure out how I feel about you ♫

164
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,120
♫ I wanna hold your hands ♫

165
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,520
♫  I won’t let go of you  ♫

166
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,300
So when I came to, I was in the street in front of the building.

167
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,170
It looks like I was lying there for quite a long time.

168
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,690
Then, what about the person called Hyeon Jae in 1994?

169
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,580
Talking about it like this, it seems like it's someone else. But in the end, that person is me, too.

170
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,850
No but, you two don't seem like the same person.

171
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,830
Figures. For me, I'm definitely myself, but I don't seem like myself.

172
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,730
It must be because the times we spent were different. And our experiences, too.

173
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,410
Then, what happened to that person?

174
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,400
I don't really know.

175
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,520
It looks like he didn't want everything to change because of him.

176
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,180
How would you know that?

177
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,410
He's me, in the end. The feeling I get tells me that's how he thought.

178
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,150
Well, you're a very strange person, you.

179
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,760
What about you? What did you do without me?

180
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,740
I actually had a lot to do.

181
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,910
Really? I have a lot of time. Tell me all about it.

182
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,870
I am excellent at telling things, but that's not all.

183
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,680
I'm very skilled at listening to other people.

184
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,660
Our Thumbs Up.

185
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,280
You didn't forget the path and found your way back well.

186
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,500
I don't know if I did well, but I suppose this is the time for me.

187
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,560
And you're here, so it's nice.

188
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,420
Oh, right. Also...

189
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,530
I think it was thanks to the compass you gave me.

190
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,770
Roar
Moo

191
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,950
It's to die for, right?

192
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,910
I'm getting addicted, bit by bit. At first, it was this much, though.

193
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,150
- Do you have somewhere to sleep?
- I'll have to search around.

194
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,620
Then... until you find somewhere to stay, you can stay here.

195
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,300
I imposed on you like this last time, how can I do it again?

196
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,310
You're not a beast.

197
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,090
Of course. I'm Yoo Hyeon Jae!

198
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,200
I'm a man who protects what needs to be protected.

199
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,590
Exactly! I also trust you.

200
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,160
Should I give you more rice?

201
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,640
What? Okay, a little more.

202
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,810
- Thumbs Up!
- What?

203
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,100
- I'm going to wash up and come back.
- Okay, go ahead.

204
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,830
Is she showering?

205
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,980
Figures. Since she said she's going to wash up, she'll probably shower.

206
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,150
I don't know, I don't know, I'm going to stop noticing.

207
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,000
Ah, why do I hear the sounds of the water so well?

208
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,280
♫ Why are you hurting me again? ♫

209
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,890
♫  Why are you trying to leave me? ♫

210
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:23,330
♫ You don’t know me at all ♫

211
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,160
♫  Baby, who are you to keep making me cry? ♫

212
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,760
Yoo Hyeon Jae, you're a man who only amounts to this?

213
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,940
No, let's stop noticing, noticing.

214
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,080
♫  Why do you still try to hurt me? ♫

215
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,020
♫ For girls ♫

216
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,040
♫  Just like me ♫

217
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,860
Yoo Hyeon Jae.

218
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,290
You're an excellent man, aren't you?

219
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,520
Why are you like this? This isn't like you.

220
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,340
♫ Actually, ♫

221
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,980
♫  Back then ♫

222
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,760
♫ You said you couldn’t live without me ♫

223
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,440
♫  Now I can’t live without you, my love ♫

224
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,270
You should wash up, too! Hurry up and wash up.

225
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,580
I-I think I have to look into somewhere

226
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,930
to stay.

227
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,290
I wasn't like this. I don't know why I'm being like this.

228
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,180
Is that so? Well, you...

229
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,830
Why do you look so exhausted in such a short time?

230
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,900
Could it be something like the aftereffect of time travel?

231
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,170
I don't know. I narrowly won a fight with myself.

232
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,950
Right. I have to go see Gwang Jae.

233
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,970
Really? You'll come back soon, right?

234
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,540
Yeah.

235
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,560
I don't know if he's okay.

236
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,820
Why did he drink so much water?

237
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,210
So you can go back and forth at will?

238
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,230
It's not my will, I'm telling you I almost died! I'll never do it again!

239
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,150
Figures. Where would a guy like you come from?

240
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,630
I'm also amazed by myself.

241
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,190
Ah, right. What about you getting treatment?

242
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you get better right away if you receive treatment?

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,770
Among my fans, there is one who is a university professor. I decided to get some help.

244
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:07,010
Well, those little kids must be our age by now.

245
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,010
That's probably the case, right?

246
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,290
You did well to come.

247
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,650
You should help with my company's work.

248
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,960
Teach the kids a bit, and write some songs.

249
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,150
That's not it. You can still be active.

250
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,410
Couldn't you debut again?

251
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:31,960
Standing on stage once is enough. I'm planning on working comfortably from behind the stage.

252
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,580
Well, that's good, too.

253
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,290
Ah, but I haven't seen President Soondae around.

254
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,250
He went on a picnic with Mal Sook. A kindergarten picnic.

255
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,890
Is he okay?

256
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:50,750
He says he's going to become the first to win in the fight against dementia and is working out extremely diligently these days.

257
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:57,400
He went out shouting he was going to obtain this many gifts at the picnic.

258
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,290
Figures. President Soondae was always the king of stubbornness.

259
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,800
Dementia will probably run away gritting its teeth first.

260
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,520
I know, right.

261
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,730
But you. Why did you help me so much?

262
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,320
I was your manager.

263
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,760
You've helped more than a manager does.

264
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,610
I don't know. Just... you looked lonely.

265
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,690
What?

266
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:36,790
I just had this feeling, "He's lonely like me, so he's being like that."

267
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,990
Thinking about it like this, I thought that I could overlook your damn personality.

268
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,830
Take care of me in the future, too.

269
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,860
You should call me CEO!

270
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,390
I never said I'd be under you. I'm going to be a freelancer!

271
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,730
Freedom!

272
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,830
The way this guy's head works, really.

273
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,680
- Yoo Hyeon Jae.
- What?

274
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,320
Don't go far away now.

275
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,740
Even from now, let's grow old together.

276
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,620
Okay?

277
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,830
Okay, let's do that.

278
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,160
One, and...

279
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,600
- Wait.
- What?

280
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,160
Did someone come?

281
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,830
- Who? No one is here, though.
- Really?

282
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,390
Ah right, Bro! What happened to you stage fright?

283
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,530
You're totally made for standing on stage.

284
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,190
I didn't know either, but whoa!

285
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,380
Could it be that I really am made for standing on stage?

286
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,820
How did you hold it in all this time?

287
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,070
Speak about yourself!

288
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,020
Shall we really go on and shake up South Korea?

289
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,980
Well since we're already started, let's shake up South Korea!

290
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,050
We are! JayB!

291
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,790
Good morning!

292
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,630
Hi, girls.

293
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,450
I'll go in right away after meeting some old friends.

294
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,570
They're all making a fuss after seeing us on TV.

295
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,970
- You can't drink.
- Got it.

296
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,350
You—

297
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,430
I came back.

298
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,520
I knew you would come back.

299
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,280
Why do you keep saying you knew, all the time?

300
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,140
I heard you debuted. Congratulations.

301
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,170
- Thank you. Did you decide to live here for good?
- Yep.

302
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,350
By Woo Seung's side?

303
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,250
Well, that too. Yep.

304
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,400
- Did Drill go somewhere?
- He went to meet friends for a bit.

305
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,130
I met your dad.

306
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:20,650
Because I wanted to tell you about your dad. About why he made that kind of choice.

307
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,890
And in the middle of all that, he kept on asking about you.

308
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,700
I told him in an excellent way.

309
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,550
I even showed him your picture. And that you're starting as a singer, too.

310
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,580
What did he say?

311
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,550
He's proud, of course.

312
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,170
Really?

313
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,250
This. Your dad said to deliver this to you.

314
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,060
It's excellent, isn't it?

315
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,400
Right. It's excellent.

316
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,500
Take good care of me, from now on.

317
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,190
That's for me to say, take good care of me from now on.

318
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:27,360
For us to be like this, no matter how I think of it, it's a really strange time.

319
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,950
That's right. It's a really strange time.

320
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,000
Cheers.

321
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,340
What are you doing here?

322
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,320
I was waiting for you, of course.

323
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,910
Why did you come all the way out here?

324
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,750
I felt anxious that you'd disappear again.

325
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,330
What?

326
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,290
- Give me your arm.
- My arm?

327
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,120
You're too much.

328
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,810
So in the future, you can't go anywhere leaving me behind.

329
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,890
Woo Seung's slave, Hyeon Jae.

330
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,470
I'll really pay you back the money. Sometime.

331
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,020
Part-timer!

332
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,390
You scared me.

333
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,950
Hey. Why are you coming out of there?

334
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,030
- I decided to live here from now on.
- What?

335
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,940
I was looking for a house and came here just in case, and the apartment next to yours was empty.

336
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,550
Anyway, please take good care of me in the future, as good next-door neighbors.

337
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,920
No, but really— How do you ...?

338
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,400
I won't bother you, don't worry! Bye! Zaijian (bye in Chinese)!

339
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,810
When do you have dinner? What will you eat? I'm not curious at all! Merong!

340
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,790
Should we go out to eat today?

341
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,500
It's fine to eat alone, but leaving such an excellent neighbor to eat alone,

342
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,430
is a sin. A big sin, at that.

343
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:32,860
You're really, really strange.

344
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,400
I'm really excellent, of course.

349

Well, we're a group born to be popular.

352
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,020
Right, so you guys moved?

353
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,100
Ah, Drill and I got a studio together.

354
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,300
What? Then what about here, is it empty?

355
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,590
Well, for now.

356
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,220
Is it?

357
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,630
Choi Woo Seung. Did you study composition well?

358
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,100
I am doing it, but it hasn't worked out as I had thought.

359
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:18,370
Right. For some reason, I think that being a civil servant would suit you better.

360
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,030
If you make a good song later, give it to us first, okay?

361
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,880
Okay.

362
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,720
Don't we have anything fresh?

363
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,900
Of course we do!

You! Th-Th-Th-Thumbs up!

370
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,050
That day, we laughed and chatted for a long time like this.

371
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,180
Our time now could be nothing.

372
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,420
Everything we have could be ungainly and trifling things,

373
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,130
but even as the poet sings, the most superb poem hasn't been written yet,

374
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,250
and the most beautiful song hasn't been sung yet.

375
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,800
Our best days are the days we haven't lived yet.

376
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,910
That is why to us, the present, everything we are doing now, is precious.

377
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,800
To all of us, we still have our best hit left.

378
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,760

Did you forget I'm an employee at World Entertainment?

402

How can you think of running away without me knowing?

403
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,000
What running away? The rent was too high over there.

404

You aren't trying to run away again, are you?
