3
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,410
Please go in.

4
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,560
I really enjoyed the food.

5
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,459
My gosh, sir.
It looks like I'm a bit late.

6
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,260
Don't worry at all.
I know how busy you are.

7
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,530
Come and have a seat here.

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,630
Okay.

9
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,039
Oh, you should sit on this cushion.

10
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,200
Thank you very much, Mr. Kim.

11
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,440
It's been a while, Mr. Han.

12
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,539
Working closely
with your young secretary

13
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,250
must be making you look younger.

14
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,250
You're looking great yourself as well

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,590
despite all the stress you've been under
due to Chairman Kim's scandal.

16
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,420
Goodness, why is it getting so tense here?

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,990
I'm visiting my hometown
after a long time. Will you keep this up?

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,530
Oh, right. Let me pour you a drink.

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,100
You know, about the terminal
relocation project

20
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,740
I'm very interested in it.

21
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,800
You're well aware of it, right?

22
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,039
Of course.
It was one of your promises.

23
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,479
I'm thoroughly checking everything
to make sure there are no mistakes.

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,920
Good. There must not be any mistakes.

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,650
-Let's drink.
-Okay.

26
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,160
Hello.

27
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,800
Why are you guys just looking
at each other? Shake hands.

28
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,930
The former and current governors
must gather strength

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,670
for the betterment of our community.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,710
It's been a long time, Mr. Han.

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,910
Yes. It's been a long time indeed,
Mr. Cheon.

32
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,880
Oh, boy.

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,420
Sir!

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,420
Did you like the food?

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,230
Who's this guy?

36
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,060
He's the head of the youth committee
I told you about.

37
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,700
Oh, is he the young man
you told me about?

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,000
(He is Mr. Cheon's henchman.)

39
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,770
(His name is Lee Jin-seok.)

40
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,710
Please allow me
to introduce myself properly.

41
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,970
Hello.

42
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,940
I oversee the youth committee.
My name is Lee Jin-seok.

43
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,050
Nice to meet you.
Without patriotic young men like you,

44
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,480
there can't be advancement of democracy.

45
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,220
I'm honored to meet you, Mr. Han.

46
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,890
Are you really the head
of the youth committee?

47
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,560
Pardon me?

48
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,460
I don't think you are.

49
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,930
Aren't you a thug?

50
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,200
Mr. Han.

51
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,010
Can't thugs be in politics?

52
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,610
-Are you siding with this thug?
-What did you just say?

53
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,710
Goodness, break it up.

54
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,680
Don't fight about things like that.

55
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,620
If we can't enter the path of salvation,

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,090
all of us will be doomed anyway.

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,660
Sir, please get in.

58
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,760
All right.

59
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,370
I'll see you around.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,840
Yes, see you.

61
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,570
-Oh, right.
-Yes.

62
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,540
I heard your son is back in town.

63
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,580
Yes.

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,210
He's staying out of trouble, right?

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,950
Chief Kim told me earlier

66
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,650
that your son was there
when the union president's son

67
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,320
got into the accident three years ago.

68
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,120
His name is Sang-hwan, right?
Han Sang-hwan.

69
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,930
Mr. Cheon.

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,530
If you want to be

71
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,030
treated respectfully as the former
governor of Muji-gun,

72
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,800
you better keep that mouth shut
and stay out of trouble yourself.

73
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,710
If you try to threaten me once again
using my son,

74
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,450
I will not let it slide.

75
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,720
All right.

76
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,560
Please allow me to apologize.

77
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,860
Shall I tell you what that hand is for?

78
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,970
It's for wiping after yourself.

79
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,340
Save it for your filthy feces!

80
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,480
Ms. Lee.

81
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,380
You better take good care of your boss.

82
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,850
That foul mouth of his
will bite him in the end.

83
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,690
Mr. Cheon.

84
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,950
I hope you live long enough

85
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,520
to go senile and smear
your feces all over your walls.

86
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,890
Take care.

I mean, our future Spiritual Mother.

90
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,630
You're athletic because you used to be
a volleyball player.

91
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,230
Who knows when you'll try
to run away again?

92
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,640
No, that won't happen again.

93
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,110
Sang-mi and I are praying a lot
these days.

94
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,380
That's right.
We shouldn't dwell on the past.

95
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,890
They'll come this way.

96
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,270
Hey, Dong-cheol.

97
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,640
(Have you caught them yet?)

98
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,800
No, we'll catch them soon.

99
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,940
I'll call you after.

100
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,090
You little...

101
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,660
-Guys, are you ready?
-My dad is a cop, you know.

102

I used to be in the wrestling team.

103
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,890
Let's go.

104
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,970
We're looking at demons.

105
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,040
They must be here to steal
what belongs to Almighty.

106
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,380
Do you know what works like a charm
when you need to get rid of demons?

107
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,010
It's this.

108
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,680
We need to beat them up to a pulp
to knock some sense into them.

109
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,180
Wan-deok, let's go.

-Where are you going?
-Let go!

-Wait, Sang-mi.
-Sang-mi.

117
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,490
Don't be fooled by them, Sang-mi.
They're evil.

118
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,260
-Sang-mi!
-Sang-mi, don't let them fool you.

119
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,500
They're demons.

120

Who the heck are you? Get out!

121

No.

and get back here already!

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,250
I'll make sure

167
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,760
Sang-mi becomes Spiritual Mother.

168
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,760
At all costs.

169
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,960
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-No matter what.

170
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,900
-Gosh.
-Oh, boy. Good work.

171
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,940
I'm so hungry right now.

172
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,410
What brings you here?

173
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,750
I never got to apologize

174
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,090
or thank you.

175
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,990
I didn't have a chance to say anything.

176
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,370
I don't need to hear it.

177
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,100
I survived thanks to you.

178
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,510
Had no one helped me that day,

179
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,150
I would've also died like my brother did.

180
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,180
So please

181
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,420
Live.

182
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,260
Thanks.

183
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,040
All of you.

184
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,740
Thanks so much.

185
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,540
Don't mention it.

186
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,480
We're in a bit of pain,

187
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,420
but the four of us could gather
like this thanks to you.

188
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,920
It's all good.

189
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,820
Things might get tougher from now on.

190
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,860
By the way, they'll try to track us down.

191
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,530
Where should we hide?

192
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,530
(WE DELIVER ALL OVER MUJI
GROUP ORDERS ARE WELCOMED)

193
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,470
We should return the car first,
don't you think?

194
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,010
I really want to see his face
when we bring the car back.

195
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,220
Oh, we're just going to a friend's place.
You don't need to worry.

196
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,370
In order to find a lost sheep,

197
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,170
I can even risk going
to the valley of death.

198
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,780
However, those who have lost their faith

199
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,580
are no longer Almighty's children.

200
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,590
Spiritual Father.

201
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,860
Please don't desert her.

202
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,730
Please.

203
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,700
Please save Sang-mi.

204
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,270
Who else can get rid of those demons
that took her?

205
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,170
Only you can do it.

206
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,780
Please. I beg you.

207
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,810
Spiritual Father, please.

208
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,420
Apostle Im, you should fast
and pray starting today.

209
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,690
This happened to Sang-mi
because you haven't been

210
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,620
praying earnestly enough.

211
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,390
Wan-deok,
why are you just standing there?

212
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,880
Apostle Kang,

213
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,250
it looks like you no longer want to be
on the Boat of Salvation.

214
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,650
Spiritual Father.

215
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,350
Do you really

216
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,190
want to end up in the fiery pit
of eternal torture?

217
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,000
Spiritual Father,
you know that I've been doing

218
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,430
my very best
to serve you and Almighty.

219
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,300
Apostle Kang.

220
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,500
Another mistake will not be tolerated.

221
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,440
Please don't

222
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,480
disappoint Almighty further.

223
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,480
Are we clear?

224
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,320
Yes.

225
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,960
Spiritual Father,
you're scaring her too much.

226
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,790
You know how hard she works.

227
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
Please don't be like this.

228
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,130
I'm sure she'll do a good job.

229
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,700
Aren't I right?

230
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,500
-Apostle Jo.
-Yes.

231
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,140
This morning,

232
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,840
I got a call from Senator Park.

233
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,650
It looks like you'll need to do
a better job from now on.

234
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,580
We've been building

235
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,089
our churches,

236
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,589
prayer retreats, and hospitals.

237
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,560
Do you want all of our hard work
to go to waste?

238
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,130
Our believers have been working
so hard for Guseonwon.

239
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,640
I must provide a strong foothold
so that their faith is never shaken.

240
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,109
That is my mission and duty.

241
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,110
Don't you agree,

242
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,950
Apostle Jo?

243
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,690
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

244
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,040
Why are you two just sitting here?

245
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,780
Go and bring Sang-mi back.

246
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,150
(GUSEONWON)

247
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,090
For goodness' sake.

248
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,960
What on earth am I doing right now?

249
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,960
What is it?

250
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,640
Food? You want food?

251
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,740
Are you kidding me?
How can you think about food right now?

252
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,580
You're way too weak for a big guy.

253
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,650
That's why we're in this mess now.
You little...

254
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,690
Follow me.

255
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,500
Get back here. Hey, do you think
we have time to eat right now?

256
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,300
Wan-deok.

257
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,670
Do you or do you not know
that I'm having trouble

258
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,300
with my business?

259
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,870
That's right.

260
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,740
I'm under a lot of stress these days,

261
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,750
so don't cause me more trouble.

262
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,390
Hey.

263
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,890
Act natural, and be quiet.

264
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,390
Let's go.

265
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,430
Sergeant Woo.

266
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,330
Hello.

267
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,200
Gosh. Apostle Jo, have you found them?

268
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,640
We've checked every place
they would go,

269
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,740
but no one has seen them.

270
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,210
Have you found anything?

271
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,910
We're looking for them
leaving everything else aside,

272
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,580
but we can't find any clues.

273
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,350
Gosh, where are they hiding?

274
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,750
How did you say the young men
who took her look like?

275
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,260
One of them was over 180cm tall,
and he had big eyes

276
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,930
and distinct facial features.

277
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,260
Another one was about 170cm tall

278
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,000
with a round face.

279
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,700
Oh, he was very cheeky.

280
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,410
The other one was a fat guy
who seemed to weigh over 100kg.

281
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,070
They seemed to have been interested
in us for a while.

282
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,240
The three of them always
went around as a group.

283
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,520
Sergeant Woo. Do you know
those guys by any chance?

284
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,390
Kids these days mostly look like that.

285
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,960
They're either tall, short, or fat.

286
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,430
That's how all kids in this town
look like.

287
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,730
When I run into my own son
on the street,

288
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,070
I can hardly recognize him.

289
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,100
-Don't you think so?
-Yes.

290
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,440
They all look similar indeed.

291
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,640
We're doing our best to find them,

292
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,480
so please don't worry.

293
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,450
Okay. Thank you so much.

294
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,750
As you already know,
she's not of sound mind.

295
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,490
If she gets into an accident...
Gosh, it would be terrible.

296
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,260
By the way,

297
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,660
if you find her, please take her
to the hospital first.

298
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,330
Okay.

299
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,670
What are you all doing?

300
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
-You are just
-Hey.

301
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,170
Let them take a rest.

302
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,080
They probably couldn't even
breathe well.

303
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,650
Gosh, you guys are

304
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,980
You haven't changed at all
since you were in high school.

305
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,480
Cut it out. Go and buy
some instant noodles.

306
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,130
I got completely beaten up
by that man with curly hair.

307
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,630
You still managed to hang on to his leg.

308
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,230
I wasn't hanging on to his leg.
I was stopping him.

309
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,040
Sang-hwan, you saw it, right?

310
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,140
I didn't.

311
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,040
You didn't? Gosh.

312
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,380
Dong-cheol, listen to these guys.
They're so mean.

313
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,550
I ran to him to stop him,

314
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,320
grabbed him hard, and got beaten up.

315
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,620
All right, I hear you.

316
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,460
Are you okay?

317
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,830
You're okay now, so stop trembling.

318
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,870
Thank you.

319
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,510
Well Sure.

320
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,720
You should thank me in particular.

321
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,080
It's crucial for broadcasters
to have a handsome face,

322
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,790
but my face was--

323
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,220
That's enough.

324
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,420
Well done.

325
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,300
Just split it in half.
I don't want to eat crumbs.

326
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,330
Put some kimchi and ham in it too.

327
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,540
You're just so rude.

328
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,140
This is my house.
You should cook it yourselves.

329
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,980
By the way,

330
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,480
we've come this far.

331
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,220
Perhaps, you should tell us now.

332
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,920
Let's eat first. She must be hungry.

333
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,420
We can stay here tonight and--

334
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,730
What are you talking about?

335
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,330
Let's stay here tonight

336
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,070
and go to the police station
where Jeong-hun's dad works tomorrow.

337
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,430
We'll figure out a way then.

338
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,570
That's right.

339
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,440
She needs to tell us the whole story
so my dad can help her.

340
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,910
Hey.

341
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,110
Take out any book
and place it under the pot.

342
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,380
All right. Let's eat first.

343
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,510
(OUR LORD OUR JOY)

344
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,920
I'm the leader of the youth group
at the church.

345
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,920
How cool.
You're so cool, Mr. Leader.

346
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,720
Gosh, you're so great.

347
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,060
Here.

348
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,330
-All right. Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

349
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,400
How many packs did you cook?

350
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,430
Aren't you going to eat?

351
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,500
They said they should

352
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,510
let the cult leader have me

353
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,580
to find salvation.

354
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,260
Are you okay?

355
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,100
Die. Die!

356
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,440
What are you doing? Don't hurt me.

357
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,040
My dear Sang-jin died because of you.
I'm going to kill you!

358
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,440
-I'm going to kill you!
-Help me.

359
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,980
-Somebody, help!
-Die!

360
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,740
I'm going to kill you!

361
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,480
Come here!

362
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,750
Sang-mi, help me. Honey!

363
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,380
I didn't do anything.

364
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,850
I just told her to eat her meal,
but she started yelling.

365
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,490
Sang-mi!

366
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,420
You must be tired.

367
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,430
Rest up by yourself here tonight.

368
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,930
-"By yourself"?
-Jeong-hun, give me your cellphone.

369
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,900
-Why?
-Just give it to me.

370
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,730
Okay.

371
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,870
That's right. Keep it just in case.

372
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,670
Don't worry.

373
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,180
We will come running if you call us.

374
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,440
What about me?

375
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,710
Let's go.

376
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,250
-This is my house.
-Let's go.

377
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,280
Come on. Rest up.

378
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,420
Hey, let's get this straight.

379
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,360
Her dad sold her off to the cult leader...

380
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,830
No, I mean

381
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,270
He's trying to let them have
a spiritual marriage.

382
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,170
Gosh, that's completely insane.
It's absurd.

383
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,500
The cult leader must have
tricked her dad first.

384
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,810
How did those people
get into our town?

385
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,210
It's no use talking about it
among ourselves.

386
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,510
We'll go to the police station
where Jeong-hun's dad works

387
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,380
and ask him to investigate on it.

388
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,750
Hey.

389
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,750
Ma'am. We're talking about
something important.

390
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,320
Don't sneak up on us.

391
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,520
Sneak up? You rude brat.

392
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,760
You're not up to something
silly again, are you?

393
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,500
Gosh, do you think we're little kids?

394
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,930
What are you staring at?

395
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,100
Shall I call your mom here right now?

396
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,900
Why would you call her?

397
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,140
-You don't need to.
-What are you saying?

398
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,040
It's not like that.
Please don't worry.

399
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,710
Here. It's on the house.

400
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,610
Thank you.

401
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,380
Couldn't she give it to us nicely?
Goodness.

402
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,390
She's a nice lady
if she didn't have such a bad temper.

403
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,060
Sang-hwan.

404
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,230
Do you have to take Sang-mi
to the police station?

405
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,400
What are you talking about?

406
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,660
I don't trust them.

407
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,470
We don't even have evidence yet.

408
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,570
Do you think the police will
investigate it properly?

409
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,970
Hey, it may not seem like it,
but my dad gets his job done.

410
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,880
That's right. We have the victim,

411
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,740
and she can give them
a detailed statement.

412
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,180
They will find evidence
as they investigate.

413
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,320
Evidence?

414
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,590
Do you think they're sloppy enough
to leave evidence?

415
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,490
Even if they find evidence,

416
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,960
it will be no use.

417
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,030
I will talk to my dad about it.

418
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,300
Don't worry.

419
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,630
In this town,
if you have money and connection,

420
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,040
you can make an innocent person guilty.

421
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,540
That's what happened before.

422
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,810
Wasn't it?

423
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,110
It will be different this time.

424
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,980
Trust me.

425
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,330
Apostle Kang.

426
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,240
Excuse me, Apostle Kang.

427
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,940
What is it?

428
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,210
I need to bring medicine to the patients.

429
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,480
Okay.

430
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,650
Here.

431
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,720
Wait, Ms. Hong.

432
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,790
Yes?

433
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,660
I don't feel very well today.

434
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,800
(KIM BO-EUN)

435
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,440
Please help Ms. Kim Bo-eun take this.

436
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,540
Me?

437
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,010
It won't be difficult.

438
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,880
Put the pills in her mouth,
and check if she swallows them.

439
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,450
Okay.

440
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,950
(DIGESTIVE AID)

441
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,140
I believe in you, Almighty, my savior.

442
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,210
Almighty.

443
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,410
You have

444
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,150
led our family

445
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,690
to this land of Muji to save us.

446
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,620
However, our faith is too weak

447
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,160
to obey you, Almighty.

448
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,530
Almighty.

449
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,200
Please show us a miracle.

450
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,800
Please save us.

451
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,110
I believe in you.
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

452
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:49,380
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

453
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,150
Please save us.

454
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,660
Hello.

455
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,100
This is a list of companies
related to Mr. Cheon.

456
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,710
Just scare them a little

457
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,510
so they can make the decision
on their own.

458
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,050
Okay. I understand.

459
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,650
That man named Cha Jun-gu.

460
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,420
He won't cause trouble later, right?

461
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,620
He helped Mr. Cheon
and got betrayed by Lee Jin-seok.

462
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,420
He's holding a deep grudge.

463
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,130
Even if something goes wrong,

464
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,490
I can make it look like
a revenge of a thug.

465
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,730
He has no family
or a gang that he belongs to.

466
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,030
Don't worry.

467
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,200
-Chief Lee.
-Yes, sir.

468
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,200
You should realize
how valuable a person is.

469
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,570
During the election,
he will have a vote too.

470
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,480
Yes. You're right.

471
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,920
Governor. You caught a big fish.

472
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,660
Gosh. You're good at fishing too.

473
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,370
What?

474
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,740
Gosh, Governor Han is

475
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,750
a humanist.

476
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,750
Let me tell you this.

477
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,720
I don't fish to catch the fish and eat it.

478
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,420
I fish because I find it funny

479
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,130
when the fish struggles to live
even with a hook in its gill.

480
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,130
That's why I fish.

481
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,830
I see.

482
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,480
Darn it.

483
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,430
You'll be a regular customer here soon.

484
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,060
I heard you owe
Lee Jin-seok something.

485
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,430
Everyone in Muji-gun knows it.

486
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,500
Don't just spread words
and crush him then.

487
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,170
What are you trying to say to me?

488
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,810
Let's work together on something.
Think of it as a part-time job.

489
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,389
I heard you came here
because you caused trouble in Seoul.

490
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,090
You're a smart guy.

491
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,560
Are you trying to threaten me
to make me do the dirty work?

492
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,290
That's how this town is.

493
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,560
We make innocent people guilty
and send them to prison.

494
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,770
It's even easier to send
a former criminal back to the prison.

495
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,300
Don't be so scared.

496
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,639
I'm a detective.
I'm not going to tell you to kill someone.

497
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,780
Fine, let's do it. What's the job?

498
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,020
Go to the companies on that list
and steal their account books.

499
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,850
If you want to finish Lee Jin-seok,

500
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,390
you should hit the people above him first.
Don't you think so?

501
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,830
I will see you later then.

502
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,910
A hooked fish struggling to live.

503
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,110
Interesting.

504
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,080
It's interesting.

505
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,580
Dear lord, please help me.

506
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,420
-Dear lord.
-Hey!

507
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,620
You'd better tell me now.

508
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,620
You're having an affair
with that pastor, aren't you?

509
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,860
Honey, please don't say
such a sinful thing.

510
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,790
Do you think I'm an idiot?

511
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,400
You go out early in the morning
and come home late at night.

512
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,670
It's because you're having an affair
with that pastor!

513
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,370
I was on night duty at the hospital.

514
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,740
How dare you try to fool me?

515
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,010
-Do you think I'll buy it?
-Stop it.

516
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,950
You're crazy, Dad.

517
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,420
-Our pastor is a great person.
-Darn it.

518
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,020
Both of you have gone completely insane.

519
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,460
All right.

520
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,630
Let's all die together tonight.
Let's just die!

521
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,700
Please help. Help us.

522
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,570
Please help us. Please.

523
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,110
Almighty.

524
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,820
Please save me from this agony.

525
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,490
I will get on the Boat of Salvation

526
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,290
and see you no matter what, Almighty.

527
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,690
I love you,

528
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,600
Almighty.

529
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,870
What are you...

530
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,680
Gosh, those brats.

531
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,010
What happened to his face?

532
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,990
-You brat.
-Gosh!

533
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,600
-Dad.
-Your dad is a police officer.

534
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,000
-You can't cause any trouble.
-Of course not, Dad.

535
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,330
-Get up, and eat breakfast.
-Okay.

536
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,270
You little...

537
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,040
I will save you.

538
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,210
I will save you no matter what.

539
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Hello?

540
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,090
It's me, Sang-hwan.

541
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,630
I need you to do something
with me today.

542
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,600
Does it need to be done today?

543
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,340
Dong-cheol.

544
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,540
Have I ever asked you for help?

545
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,310
Okay.

546
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,860
(MUJI CONSTRUCTION OFFICE)

547
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,970
Don't you want to know
what I'm going to ask you to help me with?

548
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,710
You helped me once.
So I should help you in return.

549
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,310
You punk.

550
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,420
You're all grown up now.

551
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,690
Let's go.

552
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,500
What's this?

553
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,200
Hey, call the guys.

554
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,230
Okay.

555
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,770
That's right. Call everyone

556
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,670
so that I can take care of this
in one go.

557
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,370
You must be crazy.

558
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,940
What are you doing? Go get him.

559
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,920
My gosh, all his clothes are black
or dark-colored.

560
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,430
Gosh, I can't believe he wears
these kinds of stuff.

561
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,300
She's not a model going
to a fashion show.

562
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,760
These kind of clothes
will help her stay out of sight.

563
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,700
They're all so dark.

564
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,400
Just drop it.

565
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,880
What?

566
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,740
Why does she look cute in these?

567
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,050
Are you ready?

568
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,150
Yes.

569
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,760
Let's go.

570
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,620
Jeong-hun.

571
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,520
What?

572
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,160
Let's take a taxi.

573
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,890
A taxi? Why waste money?

574
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,830
My dad's just around the corner.

575
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,730
Sang-hwan's right.
They'll recognize us right away

576
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,430
if we ride the scooter.

577
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,900
We never know what might happen.

578
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,710
Okay. Then let me call my dad

579
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,540
and ask him to come pick us up.

580
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,710
Jeong-hun.

581
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,380
We're not going to see your dad.

582
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,950
We're going to go to Muji Police Station.

583
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,350
Muji Police Station?

584
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,620
Why? Can't you trust my dad?

585
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,090
Are you looking down on him
for working at a patrol division?

586
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,490
No, that's not it.

587
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,030
Then what is it?

588
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,800
Your dad thinks

589
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,400
I'm insane.

590
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,770
What?

591
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,970
I ran away once.

592
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,080
And the people of Guseonwon
had told your dad

593
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,410
that I'm mentally ill.

594
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,780
So he sent me back there.

595
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,890
It's not because of your dad.

596
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,560
It's because of Guseonwon.

597
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,300
My gosh, don't worry.
It doesn't matter which police we go to.

598
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,300
Okay, okay.

599
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,840
Yes, let's not worry.
Everything will turn out fine.

600
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,770
Let's go.

601
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,980
We should still call Dong-cheol
and tell him, right?

602
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,310
I'll call him.

603
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,450
No, don't call him.

604
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,690
He probably worked all night last night.
Let's let him take some rest.

605
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,660
Let's just take care of this by ourselves.

606
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,200
Let's go.

607
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,500
What is this?

608
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,150
You jerk!

609
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,490
You punk.

610
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,170
Let's go.

611
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,920
Dong-cheol, I'll block them.

612
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,690
You go inside and get the files.

613
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,430
Hey.

614
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,370
Dong-cheol.

615
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,780
Aren't you the governor's son?

616
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,390
Yes, I am.

617
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,030
Why are you going to Muji Police Station?

618
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,830
My dad asked me to do something for him.

619
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,870
I see.

620
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,580
You can't take the files.

621
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,750
You have to understand that
I work for Jin-seok.

622
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,150
Let's go.

623
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,660
Wait.

624
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,870
Where... Where are you going?

625
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,390
You know me, don't you?

626
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,130
Yes.

627
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,600
You can call them
and tell them that I'm here.

628
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,340
Are you okay?

629
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,850
Hello?

630
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,160
Yes.

631
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,190
Okay.

632
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,290
Of course.

633
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,600
Mr. Kim, you will be blessed
beyond belief.

634
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,030
Yes. Our wishes will be fulfilled.

635
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,340
They just went inside the police station.

636
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,110
What if Sang-mi tells
the police something?

637
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,490
Aren't you surprised
by our Almighty's grace?

638
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:44,820
What?

639
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,400
Do you still lack faith?

640
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,300
Don't worry.

641
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,600
Our Almighty

642
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,040
puts all our believers into great use.

643
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,810
Hello, Mr. Park.

644
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,780
I didn't even do anything wrong.

645
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,120
But this place still gives me the creeps.

646
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,390
May I help you?

647
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,290
Hey, you're the governor's son.

648
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,130
I thought you were studying law in Seoul.
What brings you here?

649
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,830
Should I say "Your Honor"

650
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,700
when you become a judge?

651
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,870
So you're saying that
there's a weird cult,

652
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,140
and that your dad forced you
to go there with him?

653
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,540
And you also said that the leader
of that cult

654
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,840
is trying to get married to you
by using that cult as an excuse.

655
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,150
Am I correct?

656
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,350
Yes.

657
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,920
Detective, don't you think
this is too much?

658
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,150
They should obviously
get punished for this, right?

659
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,260
Let's walk through this
step by step.

660
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,930
Can you tell me your name
and other personal information?

661
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,470
My name is Im Sang-mi.

662
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,000
And I'm 20 years old.

663
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,810
You're Im Sang-mi?

664
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,210
Yes.

665
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,780
Then what's your dad's name?

666
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,790
He's Im Ju-ho.

667
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,390
My gosh.

668
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,920
I can't believe
I wasted my time last night.

669
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,260
How do you guys know her?

670
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,600
We're her friends.

671
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,470
Detective Lee, the chief's calling you.

672
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,840
-Right now?
-Yes.

673
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,540
Hello, chief.

674
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,510
Yes.

675
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,380
Okay.

676
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,520
Okay, I understand.

677
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,620
Call her dad and tell him to come.

678
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:55,790
Okay.

679
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,160
What did you just say?
Who did you tell him to call?

680
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,630
Excuse me, sir.

681
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,630
Her dad came to us last night
and reported that she got abducted.

682
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,970
Thanks to you,
we were on emergency alert.

683
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,270
We had to stay up all night
because of her.

684
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,240
Excuse me.

685
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,670
But her dad's the one
who locked her up inside a room.

686
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,240
That's forcible confinement.

687
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,310
Then he forced her to join a cult,

688
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,180
and he's making her marry the leader
against her will.

689
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,510
That's against the law too.

690
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,280
You know that both are
cases of criminal acts

691
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,680
regardless of whether or not
it was done by a family member.

692
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,850
We just took her out of there

693
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,920
because she asked us for help.

694
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,860
Are you still going to call her dad
to come?

695
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,760
Why are you guys getting involved
in someone else's family issue?

696
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,700
Plus, I can't start an investigation

697
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,430
only after listening to what you tell me.

698
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,370
You must know well since you study law.

699
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,970
It's not just a normal family issue.
It's family violence.

700
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,440
Anyone can report to the police
regarding family violence.

701
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,940
And as soon as you receive a report,

702
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,440
you're supposed to separate
the victim and assailant,

703
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,040
and take them to a facility
for counseling and protection.

704
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,650
How can you call the assailant
and tell him to take the victim?

705
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,050
What did you say?

706
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,190
Not all kinds of disciplinary action
are considered as family violence.

707
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,450
Listen to me.

708
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,660
You need to bring me evidence
if you want me to investigate.

709
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,130
That's how the law works.

710
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:11,600
It's very hard for a police to mess
with a religious organization.

711
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,400
Plus, do you think we're supposed
to carry out an investigation

712
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,740
every time someone comes here
and asks for one?

713
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,840
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.
This is so frustrating.

714
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,840
What did you say? Come here.

715
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,540
How many times
do we have to tell you?

716
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,910
Her dad and the cult leader
are all in this together.

717
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,810
Are you going to believe us
after her dad beats her,

718
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,320
takes her back to the cult,
and marries her off to the leader?

719
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,620
My gosh.

720
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,090
Hey, law student.

721
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,020
I can charge you
for obstruction of justice.

722
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,230
Abduction, obstruction of justice,
and contempt.

723
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,290
Do you want to get charged
with all of that?

724
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,930
But still, how can you send her back

725
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,370
when she came all the way here
to ask you for help?

726
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,900
He's right.
You already heard what we told you.

727
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,940
Miss.

728
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,040
I'm not doing this on purpose.

729
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,480
But your dad reported
that you got abducted,

730
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,580
so these guys may get in
trouble instead.

731
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,550
Is that okay with you?

732
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,420
I didn't get abducted.
I asked them for help.

733
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,090
I heard everything about
what happened yesterday at the bridge.

734
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,290
Hey, this is not a simple problem.

735
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,130
And this is a family issue,

736
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,230
so the best case scenario is
to solve this issue internally.

737
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:25,100
Miss, let me introduce you
to a family clinic.

738
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,240
You should go there with your dad.

739
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:31,540
Hey, you're supposed to be a cop.
What do you think you're doing?

740
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,780
What did you say?

741
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,320
Her dad locked her up and is trying
to marry her off to a cult leader!

742
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,250
Why would we have come here
if we could talk things out with him?

743
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,120
-Hey, get him out of here.
-Yes.

744
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,750
-This crazy punk.
-Come here.

745
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:42,990
I thought you'd be different since
you're from Seoul,

746
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,420
but you're the same piece of trash.

747
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,030
-Come over here!
-Lock them up in a holding cell.

748
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,030
How dare he talk back to a police?

749
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,700
You shouldn't do this
if you're the police.

750
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,900
-What did you say?
-Come here!

751
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,070
Do you think you can act that way
because you're the governor's son?

752
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,500
-Stop it.
-You'll end up regretting this.

753
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:57,900
What are you doing? Lock them up!

754
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,470
Please stop it!

755
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,850
I'll go back.

756
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,850
I'll go back to Guseonwon.

757
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,190
So just let them go.

758
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,960
Sang-mi.

759
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,100
I knew things would turn out this way.

760
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,800
I'll do my best to take care of it.

761
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,980
Good thinking.
The quickest way is

762
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,340
to take care of these kind of problems
on your own.

763
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,810
Regardless,
I want all three of them locked up.

764
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,880
-Okay, sir.
-Come on, let's go.

765
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,190
-Come on.
-Follow me.

766
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,590
-Come here.
-My gosh, come over here.

767
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,990
Let's go. Come on.

768
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,100
My gosh, this is so annoying.

769
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,100
This makes no sense at all.

770
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,300
Something needs to happen in order
for them to become guilty.

771
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,380
(GUSEONWON)

772
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,160
Why are you driving like that?

773
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,520
This is a crosswalk.

774
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,460
Sergeant Woo.

775
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,170
-Have a good day.
-My goodness.

776
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,940
My gosh, he's so kind.

777
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:13,470
(GUSEONWON)

778
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:20,170
The worship service has begun.

779
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,140
Let's go.

780
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,180
I'll go on my own.

781
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:17,200
(SAVE ME)

782
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,370
Hey, hey.

783
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,540
Hey, we've never been
to a place like this before.

784
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,370
Hey, we're not here to play around.

785
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,310
Guys, be quiet.

786
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,050
Hey, Dong-cheol.
They're in the park.

787
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,180
Okay, be careful.

788
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,780
Is he going to begin?

789
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,120
Gosh, my shoelace came undone.

790
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,460
Excuse me.

791
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,830
Yes?

792
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,700
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.

793
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
No, it's okay. What's up?
