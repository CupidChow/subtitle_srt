1
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,930
(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,600
I saw Sang-mi.

3
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,870
(EPISODE 8)

4
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,580
I think she's in big trouble.

5
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,960
I ran into her after three years,

6
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,989
and she asked me

7
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,730
to save her.

8
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,000
She asked me,

9
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,340
not anyone else.

10
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,210
I know

11
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,480
that I hurt

12
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,080
you and her.

13
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,020
This time,

14
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,390
I won't run away.

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
I want to save her

16
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,100
before it's too late.

17
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,820
Sang-mi.

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,820
Do you know how startled I was earlier?

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,090
How dare you touch Spiritual Father?

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,090
What are you going to do
if you get into trouble?

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,660
What about me?

22
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,770
Do you even care about
the fact that I got hurt too?

23
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,980
Of course, I do.
I'm worried about you too.

24
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,780
-But Sang-mi
-He has abilities, doesn't he?

25
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,820
You said he can touch fire
and cure diseases as a savior.

26
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,850
What's the problem then?

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,820
He only shed a drop of blood.

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,230
What's the big deal about it?

29
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,060
I'm just worried that
Almighty might punish you.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
-Dad.
-Yes?

31
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,070
I remember you

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,880
as a loving and caring dad.

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,150
I hope those memories won't disappear.

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,420
Mom has been sick,
but I was able to withstand it

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,520
only because I still remember you
at that time.

36
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,630
But

37
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,230
whenever I see you changing like this,

38
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,900
I'm scared that those memories
will disappear.

39
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,570
So please.

40
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,510
For my sake,

41
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,680
stop pushing me
into something strange, okay?

42
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,680
Please.

43
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,150
I beg you to stop.

44
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,590
Sang-mi.

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,100
I'm doing this because I love you,
and I worry about you.

46
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,970
If you

47
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,770
can be saved by becoming Spiritual Mother,

48
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,740
I will do anything.

49
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,520
Dad.

50
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,380
(Mom, can you hear me?)

51
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,750
(It's your son, Sang-hwan.)

52
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,620
(I got into a college in Seoul.)

53
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,590
(If you had seen me, you would've
said you're proud of me.)

54
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,130
It must've been boring for you
to keep listening to the same thing.

55
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,410
Mom.

56
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,120
There is a girl that I used to like.

57
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,220
She moved here from Seoul
when we were in high school.

58
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,360
I fell in love with her at first sight.

59
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,000
But

60
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,400
when she asked me to help her,

61
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,510
do you know what I did?

62
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,510
I ran away.

63
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,750
Well...

64
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,320
I don't know

65
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,390
what she's doing now,

66
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,490
or

67
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,460
why she asked me to save her.

68
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,060
I don't know that,

69
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,400
but I can't

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,770
stop worrying about her.

71
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,350
Gosh, Jun-gu.

72
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,320
It's been a long time.

73
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,450
How is your work going?

74
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
This is a small town. It's the same.

75
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,190
-What is it? Is it broken?
-No.

76
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,190
What is it then?

77
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,060
Can you let someone work here?

78
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,230
Who?

79
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,830
Who else? It's me.

80
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,070
Gosh, why would you work
at a place like this?

81
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,070
What's the problem?
Is it because I'm an ex-convict?

82
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,940
No, that's not what I meant.

83
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,110
Oh, hello.

84
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,920
Hey. You're Man-hui, right?
Gosh, look at you.

85
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,290
You've put on so much weight.

86
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,660
-Don't say that.
-It's good to see you.

87
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,560
The thing is, the pay is low.
It's a tough job.

88
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,260
I just need enough to sustain myself.
What shall I start with?

89
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,300
Do you go to church?

90
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,030
What? Oh, this.

91
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,400
No, I don't.

92
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,070
There's something I heard
from a pastor while I was in jail.

93
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,680
"Only those who have never
sinned can hurl stones at me."

94
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,850
Let's say that someone who has sinned
threw a stone at me.

95
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,450
Then I'll teach that person a lesson
regardless of who he is.

96
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,720
What do you think?

97
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,320
-It has a great meaning.
-Yes.

98
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,760
Bring me some work clothes.

99
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,530
(DRIVABLE DISTANCE 346KM)

100
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,530
Gosh, it's acting up again.

101
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,340
I should scrap this clunker
and get a new car.

102
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
Friend.

103
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,490
I must bring luck wherever I go.

104
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,960
I see that we're already getting
so many customers.

105
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,770
Jun-gu.

106
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,200
Go inside.

107
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,050
Did you guys bring thugs
from other areas just to kill me?

108
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,520
What are you waiting for?

109
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,360
-Whack him!
-Go, guys!

110
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,210
Sergeant Woo,
there's a fight going on here.

111
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,820
A bunch of thugs are vandalizing my store.

112
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,920
Please get here
as soon as possible. Thank you.

113
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,310
Hey, you guys...

114
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,440
You guys aren't punks.

115
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,850
You're in the family.
Don't embarrass other thugs.

116
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,420
You little Come here.

117
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,230
Gosh, I shouldn't have come this way.

118
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,700
Detective Kim, come to
the auto shop with a few guys.

119
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,870
There's a big fight going on here.

120
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,420
My goodness.

121
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,720
It looks like even those who beat up
people and walk all over others

122
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,660
go to church these days to be redeemed.

123
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,300
Why is that?

124
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,670
Do you feel like someone will save you
if you come here?

125
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,310
Don't just wish for good luck and fortune.

126
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,280
You guys should repent your sins.

127
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,490
Hey.

128
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,530
Did Lee Jin-seok tell you to whack me?

129
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,430
Lee Jin-seok?

130
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,070
There are guys who get
in the way of everything

131
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,140
the governor is trying to do.

132
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,510
He is Mr. Cheon's henchman.

133
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,110
(His name is Lee Jin-seok.)

134
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,510
Answer me.

135
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,620
Gosh, you jerk.
You never even visited me in jail,

136
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,890
and you're trying to stab me now.

137
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,300
Please forgive me this once.
I just did what I was told to do.

138
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,830
Right.

139
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,700
I know.

140
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,210
Today

141
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,740
I won't tell your boss.

142
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,560
I heard that you're hung up there

143
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,730
to pay for others' sins,
not for what you did.

144
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Stop being so stupid.

145
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,870
Come down already.

146
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,530
Can't you thugs fight elsewhere?

147
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,530
Even governmental authorities
leave religious facilities alone.

148
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,430
Look at me.
I was waiting for you at the door.

149
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,270
You rats.

150
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,840
My gosh, Chief Lee. What brings you here?

151
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,480
How did you hear about the fight?

152
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,610
The owner of the auto shop called us.

153
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,580
I'll take this guy to the station.
There's another one inside.

154
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,090
Hang on.
This happened within our jurisdiction.

155
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,460
We should take them
to the substation first...

156
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,330
Oh, this guy is...

157
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,060
Why? Do you know him?

158
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,830
-Officer Choe.
-Yes.

159
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,830
Escort him to Muji Police Station.

160
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,800
Well Sure.

161
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,180
He got released from jail recently.

162
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,420
He's on our list of ex-offenders
to keep an eye on.

163
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,780
Which family does he belong to?

164
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,690
He doesn't even belong anywhere.
He's on his own.

165
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,760
I heard he's very weird.

166
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,690
You should be careful.

167
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,860
Don't you know who I am?

168
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,330
I'm Lee Gang-su.

169
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,470
Oh, right.

170
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,940
I heard about your achievements
back in your prime.

171
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,180
You're notorious among those
who work at the bars and lounges.

172
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,120
Thugs tried to whack him
as soon as he got released.

173
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,450
You should be my dog.

174
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,720
Bark, you jerk. Bark all you want.

175
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,790
Look at you.

176
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,700
-Sir.
-Yes.

177
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,370
Chief Lee Gang-su would like
to meet with you.

178
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,640
He's doing a good job with
what I asked him to do, right?

179
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,840
He wants to move back to Seoul, you know.

180
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,440
He'll figure out what's important.

181
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,380
Don't trust him too much though.

182
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,310
Those who betrayed you once
will always betray you again.

183
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,210
I'll meet up with him for a meal soon.

184
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,350
Got it, sir. Oh, Senator Park called too.

185
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,790
He must want to talk to me
about relocating the terminal.

186
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,790
It was one of his promises,

187
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,420
yet he dumped it on Mr. Cheon.

188
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,530
And now what? Does he want me
to clean up his mess?

189
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,060
It was one of Senator Park's promises,

190
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,070
but you can turn it
into your achievement, sir.

191
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,640
But for me to deal with that sly old man,

192
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,370
I'll need insurance, don't you think?

193
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,980
Yes, I'll let Chief Lee know.

194
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,550
All right.

195
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,880
-Sir.
-Yes?

196
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,690
You left this yesterday.

197
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,330
Ji-hui.

198
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,430
Do you know how precious
that watch is to me?

199
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,130
My father, who couldn't even graduate
from elementary school,

200
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,470
got that watch when he became
a village foreman.

201
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,540
He must've been so proud of it.

202
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,340
He never took it off until he passed away.

203
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,940
He said this one thing

204
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,280
as he was giving it to me
in his final moments.

205
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,250
"You must become successful."

206
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,880
Those were his last words.

207
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,890
You should become
the next provincial governor.

208
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,800
Ji-hui.

209
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,340
It looks like
you're completely my person now.

210
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,320
You've been here for a while.
You should go back to Seoul

211
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,520
and get ready for the law school.

212
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,420
He's right, Sang-hwan. If you study hard,
it would make your mom happy.

213
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,890
Do you think you're my mom now?

214
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,930
Of course not.

215
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,829
-I respect your mother very much.
-Respect?

216
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,640
Are you kidding me right now?

217
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,910
Han Sang-hwan.
Why are you being so rude to Ms. Lee?

218
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,780
Dad. Do you know how lonely
Mom is right now?

219
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,980
Of course, I do.

220
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,950
Are you going to keep breaking my heart?

221
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,780
Sang-hwan. I think you misunderstood us.

222
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm just helping him as his assistant--

223
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,220
Look.

224
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,190
Do you still see me as a kid?

225
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,990
If you touch my mom
with those filthy hands again,

226
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,260
I won't just let it slide.

227
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,210
Detective.

228
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,210
You scratched that car.

229
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,810
We know you did.

230
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,810
-You two beat him up, right?
-That's not what happened.

231
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,650
Let me explain.

232
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,030
-Chief.
-What's the conclusion?

233
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,800
It was a self-defense.

234
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,760
Those thugs hit him first.

235
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,970
The owner of the auto repair shop
says the same thing,

236
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,700
and the security camera recorded it.

237
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,740
What about the thing
I asked you about?

238
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,250
Oh, as soon as he was released,
he went to see the nightclub owner,

239
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,720
Lee Jin-seok of Bull Gang.

240
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,720
They had a big fight,
and Lee Jin-seok was crushed by him.

241
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,790
Did something happen between them?

242
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,430
Lee Jin-seok was under the charge
of attempted murder nine years ago.

243
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,460
That guy said he did it,
and he went to jail instead of Jin-seok.

244
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,030
It looks like Jin-seok abandoned him
and betrayed him

245
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,370
after that.

246
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,870
I got it. Go out and deal
with the ones we arrested.

247
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,970
Yes, sir.

248
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,000
You want to destroy Lee Jin-seok, right?

249
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,770
You see, I'm a detective.

250
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,640
What do detectives do?

251
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,010
You had something unfair happen to you,

252
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,340
and I can make it right.
That's what detectives do, right?

253
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,480
My gosh.

254
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,520
What kind of nonsense
are you trying to tell me?

255
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,090
You need strength for sure,

256
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,360
but you need to use your brain
from time to time.

257
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,130
I'm saying I will be your brain.

258
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,700
Even if you keep doing this,

259
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,470
Lee Jin-seok won't go down.

260
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,670
Why? He has a powerful boss
who is watching his back.

261
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,370
You know this, don't you?

262
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
What are you saying?

263
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,250
Are you saying you will back me up?

264
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,750
Would I be enough for you?

265
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,790
Do you know who the boss of
everyone in Muji-gun is?

266
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,870
Wisely choose whom you'll work for,

267
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,900
so both of us

268
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,210
can survive.

269
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,080
Let's eat something.
Do you like tough beef soup?

270
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,980
Everyone in Muji-gun

271
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,010
likes tough beef soup.

272
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,650
Gosh, that's good.

273
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,890
This is why I like Muji-gun.

274
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,120
It's full of love and passion.

275
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,990
Let's go.

276
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,960
Hey, I said no.
I'll get into trouble if I get caught.

277
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,370
Come on, we're friends.
Don't be petty.

278
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,870
It's something I can't do.
We're not even that close.

279
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,000
My gosh. Hey.

280
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,670
He has ordered food
from your restaurant countless times.

281
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,880
Is this how you treat your VVIP customer?

282
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,380
If you keep doing this,
I will make a campaign about

283
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,650
the hair we found in your food
the other day.

284
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,180
It's a complaint, not a campaign.

285
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,790
-Complaint.
-Complaint.

286
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,490
Sang-hwan, what are you up to?

287
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,630
We need to hide someone and run away.

288
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,830
You're not trying to kidnap someone,
are you?

289
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,600
Hey, what are you talking about?

290
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,030
You're right. It's kidnapping.

291
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,370
-What?
-What?

292
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,810
We're not the kidnappers.

293
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,840
We're trying to save someone
who has been kidnapped.

294
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,410
That's right.

295
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,750
Listen. Please help us out this once.
Come on.

296
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,680
What are you all saying?

297
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,560
How will I deliver food then?

298
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,330
There.

299
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,130
Take your pick.
We have a white one and a black one.

300
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,810
(KIM BO-EUN)

301
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,220
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Excuse me.

302
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,820
Have you seen my mom
who is staying in this room?

303
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,890
-Ms. Kim Bo-eun?
-Yes.

304
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,360
She told the nurses that
she'd like to go and pray.

305
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,130
I see. Thank you.

306
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,160
Wait.

307
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,400
I heard a rumor that
you will become Spiritual Mother.

308
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,570
Is it true?

309
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Do you even know what
Spiritual Mother is?

310
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,510
She's the mother of all spirits,

311
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,380
isn't she?

312
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,580
Why did you come here?

313
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,480
Because I want to be saved
and go to the paradise, of course.

314
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,820
Leave while you can.

315
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,690
-I'm sorry?
-If you can't leave, run away.

316
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,590
If you stay here,
both your body and soul will die.

317
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Why aren't you leaving then?

318
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,440
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

319
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,610
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

320
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,610
Su-ri. What are you doing here?

321
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,780
She asked me where the patient is.

322
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,620
Didn't you hear
what Apostle Kang said?

323
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,590
You can't casually talk
to Sang-mi from now on.

324
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,590
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

325
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,260
If you're done here,

326
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,060
go to Room 303,
and help the patients bathe.

327
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,800
-Room 304? Okay.
-It's Room 303.

328
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,870
She doesn't know anything
because she's from Seoul.

329
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,940
Sang-mi.

330
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,250
You still have soft hair like a baby.

331
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,620
-Help me!
-They scream

332
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,180
from time to time.

333
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,940
Almighty.

334
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,340
Help me.

335
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,580
-I love you, Almighty.
-Almighty.

336
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,420
Please be here with me.

337
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,920
(GRAPEVINE)

338
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,500
Mom.

339
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,010
My daughter, it's you.

340
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,580
What brings you here, Sang-mi?

341
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,680
What on earth are you trying to do now?

342
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,120
Be respectful, will you?

343
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,990
You know that I'm an apostle.

344
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,320
Apostle Jo Wan-tae.

345
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,560
If you

346
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,630
laid a finger on my mom,

347
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,100
I'll be sure to kill you.

348
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,030
How scary.

349
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,870
Your eyes look so spiteful right now.

350
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,180
Sang-mi, I've seen many people
with those eyes.

351
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,280
They didn't even have a chance
to make eye contact with me though.

352
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,010
Do you know why?

353
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,190
Because I killed them first.

354
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,590
Do you think I'm lying right now?

355
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,490
Do you?

356
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,260
Earlier today,

357
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,700
Apostle Jo told me
about playing soccer with Sang-jin.

358
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,510
It was such a funny story.

359
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,370
You should've heard it too.

360
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,180
It's true, right?

361
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,510
Sang-jin really scored a goal, right?

362
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,750
Mom, Sang-jin is--

363
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,020
Of course.

364
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,120
He's so good at soccer.

365
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,790
He's so skilled.

366
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,840
What are you doing now?

367
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,950
Three years have passed,

368
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,620
yet you still have downy hair like a baby.

369
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,600
Right.

370
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,470
You'll become
Spiritual Father's new bride.

371
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,510
I should keep you safe.

372
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,810
Aren't I right, Ms. Kim?

373
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,310
Yes.

374
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,020
Please take good care
of Sang-jin and Sang-mi.

375
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,320
Gosh, have you forgotten who I am?

376
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,890
I'm the manager of Guseonwon
and an apostle.

377
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,300
Have a good time with your mother.

378
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,890
Sang-mi, what's the matter?
Are you feeling sick?

379
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,800
Are you?

380
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,000
Mom.

381
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,930
Let's get you out of here.

382
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,170
Sang-jin also wants you

383
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,340
to stay at a sanitarium instead of here.

384
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,380
Did he really say that?

385
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,150
Yes.

386
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,960
Then I should go.

387
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,660
Both of my twins don't want me
to stay here,

388
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,330
so I should leave.

389
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,030
Right, Sang-mi?

390
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,470
Yes.

391
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,470
Let's go.

392
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,900
Okay.

393
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,480
(ALMIGHTY IS OUR SAVIOR.
ALMIGHTY, PLEASE BLESS US)

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,000
"I am"

395
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,970
"showing this as proof
to be redeemed from my sins."

396
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,270
"My faith allowed me
to become a new person"

397
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,180
"and meet Almighty."

398
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,680
"This is paradise
and Almighty's revelation."

399
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,600
Almighty, please don't abandon me.

400
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,400
Please don't desert me

401
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,610
Please forgive and save me.

402
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,210
Please look over me.

403
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,220
Gosh, when will they leave?
I hope it's soon.

404
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,360
Are you sure they'll come out?
What if we're wasting our time?

405
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,060
Just wait. They go to pray
at the break of dawn.

406
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,800
Did you see that?

407
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,370
Yes, I can see too.

408
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,660
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

409
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,540
(GUSEONWON)

410
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,940
My gosh, what is this place?
It looks like a castle.

411
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,880
Sang-hwan, we can't sneak in
by climbing over that fence.

412
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,110
I'm out.

413
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,850
Well, I'm sure there's another entrance.

414
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,290
Almighty's message of salvation

415
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,360
completely gets rid
of our spiritual thirst

416
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,730
because his grace quenches us
from within.

417
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,600
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

418
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,630
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

419
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,030
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

420
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,080
Come to me,
and I'll relieve your thirst!

421
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,780
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

422
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,520
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

423
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,890
Those who believe me will be saved
and be eternally free from thirst.

424
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,760
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

425
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,760
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

426
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,850
What are you doing now?

427
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,389
You have to pray.

428
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,960
What do I have to pray for?

429
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,600
Pray so that you can get rid
of that bad attitude!

430
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,670
They're coming out. Over there.

431
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,540
This must be it.

432
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,080
It looks like this place
is their home ground.

433
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,550
What's that on their faces?

434
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,179
Everyone.

435
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,260
Almighty's blessings are with you.

436
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,020
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

437
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,330
It's obviously a cult.

438
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,190
Let's wait a few more minutes.

439
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,800
Let's pray once more.

440
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,460
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

441
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,500
-Let's get closer.
-All right.

442
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, hold on a second.

443
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,570
Will you do a live broadcast again?

444
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,980
I should record inside of the building
and the leader's face.

445
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,290
My gosh, do you see him?

446
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,260
That man with blond hair.
I bet he's the leader of this cult.

447
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,590
He totally looks like a con artist.

448
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,300
Hey, it's her. It's that girl.

449
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,100
Darn it.

450
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,530
Hey.

451
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,810
How's your hand?

452
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,520
Is your scar gone?

453
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,590
It's not a big deal.
More importantly,

454
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,020
you are our holy spirit.

455
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,130
I'm so sorry for what she did to you.

456
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,270
All scars will heal with time.

457
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,440
That's equal to patience.

458
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,670
Sang-mi, you and your father

459
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,180
have been patiently waiting
for a long time now.

460
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,480
What do you think all of that was for?

461
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,120
It was obviously for

462
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,950
your mother and brother.

463
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,460
My wish is

464
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,430
to help you receive salvation.

465
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,180
Yes.

466
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:05,250
If you start to obey our Almighty
like this,

467
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,150
he shall exist inside you

468
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,320
with an undying happiness.

469
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,400
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

470
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,800
You did the exact same thing back then.

471
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,340
You

472
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,640
put your hand on me
and my brother's shoulders.

473
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,250
Then you pretentiously acted
as if you were a true pastor.

474
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,550
Sang-mi.

475
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,050
I'm not a fake pastor.

476
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,790
The fake pastors are the ones
who dwell in the world of evil.

477
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,360
I'm not going to give up no matter
how much you threaten me.

478
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,200
I'm going to

479
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,000
reveal how dirty and disgusting
this place is

480
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,140
to the world no matter what.

481
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
Okay.

482
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,350
I too shall never give up on you

483
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,820
regardless of how hard the devil tries to

484
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,790
take you away from our Almighty.

485
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,460
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

486
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,690
My gosh, that scared me.

487
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,960
Did you see the look in his eyes?
My gosh.

488
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,230
I knew that would happen
because of your live show.

489
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,130
I'm sorry.

490
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,740
Do you think he saw us?

491
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,240
I don't think so.
We were quite far away.

492
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,110
Hey, isn't he the cult leader?

493
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,080
-Yes, it's him. He has yellow hair.
-Let's get in.

494
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,090
Let's go. Come on. Hurry.

495
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,320
What are you doing? Let's go.

496
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,060
Sang-hwan, don't go. Stop it.
Sang-hwan.

497
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,940
You guys are

498
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,970
the young men who once
got into an accident

499
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,040
with my apostles, right?

500
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,510
Are you the leader of this cult?

501
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,250
"The leader of this cult"?

502
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,920
I'm just a pastor.

503
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,620
What's your purpose?

504
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,620
My gosh,
that was a bit too straightforward.

505
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,090
What purpose?

506
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,560
I'm asking what your purpose is.

507
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,500
I'm going to go to paradise

508
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,110
with everyone who's seeking
to receive salvation.

509
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,540
So you're saying that

510
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,510
you're going to go all the way, right?

511
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:51,620
You're a foolish young man
who only sees what you wish to see.

512
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,230
This is a sacred place.

513
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,630
When dirty souls try to enter,
they will be doomed.

514
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,230
So stop what you're doing,
go back to your world

515
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,740
and live your lives.

516
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,940
Do you understand?

517
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,180
If you're going to go all the way,

518
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,650
so will we.

519
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,020
Do you understand?

520
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,230
If you decide to go that far,

521
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,960
that place

522
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,430
shall be the valley of death

523
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,030
and a fiery pit.

524
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,960
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

525
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,860
-Thank you.
-Tell me if you need more.

526
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,000
It's okay.

527
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,700
I'm going to

528
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,370
drink this from now on.

529
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:28,950
Ma'am.

530
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,050
Do you feel sick?

531
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,990
By the way,

532
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,730
I heard you're going to become
the Spiritual Mother.

533
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,390
If you really do become
the Spiritual Mother,

534
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,930
please take me with you
on the Boat of Salvation.

535
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,070
I'm sure Jeong-gu's waiting for me

536
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,440
to come see him.

537
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,910
Okay?

538
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,340
Ma'am.

539
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,210
Jeong-gu

540
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,050
didn't die because of an accident.

541
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,120
You need to go to the police
and ask for a reinvestigation.

542
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,960
Jeong-gu is with our Almighty in paradise.
What are you saying?

543
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,660
You're hurting me.

544
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,360
Jeong-gu is in paradise.
He's in paradise.

545
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,930
-He's in paradise!
-Ma'am.

546
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,730
It hurts. Please let go of my hand.

547
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,570
-Ma'am.
-He's in paradise!

548
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,170
Let me go! Mom, help me!

549
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,740
That's why I need to go to paradise too!

550
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,210
I need to meet Jeong-gu.

551
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,220
Please take me with you
when you become the Spiritual Mother.

552
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,290
Ma'am.

553
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,460
What are you doing right now?

554
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,830
My gosh.

555
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,500
What in the world did I do?

556
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,370
Sang-mi is a very precious person
for us in Guseonwon.

557
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,900
My goodness, what should I do?

558
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,040
I must have become insane.

559
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,770
-Apostle Im.
-Yes?

560
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,480
Apostle Kang, please.

561
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,880
I'm so sorry for what I did.

562
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,610
Take Sang-mi home.

563
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,020
-I still have some more work
-Right now!

564
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,320
Okay.

565
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,260
This person wants her son
to pass the test.

566
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,260
He passed.

567
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,200
"Jeong Mi-yeong".

568
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,300
My gosh, shouldn't she get tired of
doing this now?

569
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,700
She's always asking us to help
her son get married.

570
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,570
If she wants him to get married,
she should send him to a matchmaker.

571
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,350
What's the use of sending this here?
My goodness.

572
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,780
Let's see. Come in.

573
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,560
Hello, sir.

574
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,230
Did you eat?

575
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,360
Is Spiritual Father not here?

576
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,060
No, he's not.

577
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,070
I see.

578
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,670
Please make sure to give this

579
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,510
to Spiritual Father.

580
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,710
I guess you're here to make
a special contribution.

581
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,910
I sold my cows for this.

582
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,820
Please give this

583
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,720
to Spiritual Father.

584
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,190
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

585
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,560
You're filled
with our Almighty's blessings.

586
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,030
If you keep up your faith,
you'll definitely get a first class seat.

587
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,930
My gosh, that's too much.

588
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,540
I still have a long way to go

589
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,370
before I get accepted into
the Boat of Salvation.

590
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,870
Plus, I need to take
my children with me too.

591
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,210
Don't you worry.

592
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,550
I'll ask Spiritual Father

593
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,080
to pray for you.

594
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,290
I hope you keep believing.

595
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,090
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

596
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,020
I'll be off then.

597
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,530
My gosh.

598
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,970
Hello, Spiritual Father.

599
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:11,200
I just came in to say hello
to Apostle Jo.

600
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,970
You're leaving already?

601
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,510
You should drink tea
since you're here.

602
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:19,080
No, it's okay. I need to go
and clean my cows' wastes.

603
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,050
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

604
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,050
Spiritual Father, I'll go now.

605
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,920
-Okay. Have a safe trip home.
-Okay.

606
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,460
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

607
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,630
My gosh.

608
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,100
My gosh, the peach is very ripe.

609
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,470
You're helping me out a lot.

610
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,510
No, it's nothing.

611
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:53,910
I'm not doing this for myself.

612
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,120
I'm doing this for our Almighty.

613
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,620
If we make a bigger church
and build a hospital,

614
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,620
it'll benefit our believers.

615
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,390
You're right.

616
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,730
That will be our Almighty's grace
and blessing.

617
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,530
Our Almighty shall
bless the land of Muji.

618
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,810
But I have a question.

619
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,310
Why are you insisting on making
Sang-mi the Spiritual Mother?

620
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,550
She seems to have quite a bad temper.

621
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:33,590
The world we're living in is full of evil.

622
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,290
In order for all of us
to get on the Boat of Salvation

623
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,560
on the day of judgement,

624
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,130
we need to take in a pure scapegoat.

625
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,330
To me, Sang-mi is the pure scapegoat

626
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,200
that will allow all of us
to receive salvation.

627
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,670
Do you now understand why

628
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,610
I am trying to make Sang-mi
the Spiritual Mother

629
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,850
by getting married to her?

630
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,720
I have to say,

631
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,660
you really are and
always have been peculiar.

632
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,880
(She asked me)

633
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,680
(to save her.)

634
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,790
(LIGHTNING QUICK DELIVERY SERVICE)

635
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,360
My gosh.

636
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,100
Look at how they're looking at him.

637
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,670
I think they've all been brainwashed.
It's weird.

638
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,400
Don't you think
this is going to be dangerous?

639
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,020
You guys, let's do this.

640
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,350
The devils must be causing trouble
because they're jealous that

641
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,460
you're going to become
the Spiritual Mother.

642
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,430
At times like this,

643
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,560
you need to focus on praying more.

644
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,300
Do you really not understand
what they're trying to do to me?

645
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,140
Dad, you're

646
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,110
practically selling me off to them.

647
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,840
Sang-mi, just like what
Spiritual Father said,

648
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,750
I'm never going to give up on you either.

649
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,890

(HAN SANG-HWAN)

00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,790
(YOU NEED TO BE CLEAR IN ORDER
FOR ME TO HELP YOU.)

653
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,300
(ARE YOU LOCKED UP RIGHT NOW?)

654
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,910
(DID YOU MEAN IT
WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO SAVE YOU?)

655

I WILL COME AND SAVE YOU.)

(DONG-CHEOL)

657
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,160
Is she

658
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,070
really in trouble?

659
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,470
I think

660
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:30,840
she's being locked up
by some weird cult believers.

661
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,080
I also saw a cult believer in prison.

662
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,690
He started believing
in some weird religion,

663
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,390
and he killed his child saying
that his child was possessed.

Sang-hwan.

665
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,630
Are you really

666
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:57,440
not going to run away this time?

667
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:01,370
This time,

668
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,210
I'm never going to run away.

669
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,230
Hey, Dong-cheol.

670
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,170
You...

671
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:34,240
This guy looks good in anything.
Right? Don't you agree?

672
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,280
Hey, do you know how much
I missed you?

673
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,050
Come here, Dong-cheol.

674
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,150
Move.

675
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:49,490
Have you been doing well?

676
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,600
I know you suffered a lot.

677
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,870
Hey, come on. It's been three years
since we've all gathered together.

678
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,870
Let's drink.

679
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:12,740
(MUJI ARABIAN NIGHT CLUB)

680
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:17,950
Then should we sneak into her house
in the middle of the night

681
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,280
and bring her out secretly?

682
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,590
Are you crazy?
That's not going to be easy.

683
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:26,490
And what if she ends up saying
that she never asked us for help?

684
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,660
That won't happen.

685
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,500
The look in her eyes

686
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,530
was the same as what I saw
three years ago.

687
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:36,370
She seemed really desperate.

688
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,740
Dong-cheol, aren't you going to work?

689
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,940
Boss will be upset if he finds out
you were here during working hours.

690
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,280
I'm getting up.

691
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,720
-When do you plan on going?
-Early this morning.

692
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,050
When they head for service
will be the perfect chance.

693
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,790
All right.
Then I'll see you at dawn.

694
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,590
All right. Keep up the
good work.

695
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,690
Hey, Han Sang-hwan.

696
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,730
Do you know
how Dong-cheol makes a living?

697
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,840
He makes deliveries during the day
and works here at night.

698
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:13,840
What are you trying to say?

699
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:18,010
He's trying to settle down and
make a living. Don't get him in trouble.

700
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:21,650
If you get in trouble,
you have your father to rely on.

701
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,280
He has no one. You should know that.

702
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,550
Don't think you know everything
based on what you see.

703
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,460
Whatever you say won't change things.

704
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,630
You two clearly come
from different backgrounds.

705
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,900
Face it. It's fate.

706
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:40,930
Sang-hwan. Don't bother.

707
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,900
Let's go. Let's not make a fuss here.

708
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,070
He's right, Sang-hwan.

709
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,570
Go ahead and hit me.

710
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,540
After all, you have your father

711
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,680
to protect you, don't you?

712
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,450
Background? Fate?

713
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,390
I'm going to change all that.

714
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,360
Let's go. Come on.

715
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,610
Go ahead and drink up.

716
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,420
Hello, senator.

717
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,850
I must be late.

718
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,920
No, not at all. I know how busy
you must be. Have a seat here.

719
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,560
You should sit on this cushion.

720
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,430
Why, thank you, Mr. Kim.

721
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,760
It's been a long time, Governor Han.

722
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,840
You look younger. It must be because
you have such a young assistant.

723
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,640
Director Ji,
you're looking good yourself

724
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,940
considering all you've been through
because of Chairman Kim's scandal.

725
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,150
Goodness.

726
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,810
Hello.

727
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,280
What are you waiting for?
You should exchange handshakes.

728
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,450
The former and current governors
should join hands.

729
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:13,060
That way, the local community
will be able to develop greatly.

730
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,400
It's been a long time, Governor Han.

731
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,400
It has been a long time, Mr. Cheon.

732
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,050
Dong-cheol.

733
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,620
I know it's none of my business,
but don't do anything stupid.

734
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,760
Don't let them take
advantage of you again.

735
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,730
You and I come from different backgrounds.
They're different.

736
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,060
I can take care of myself.

737
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,940
You may have been friends in school,
but you can't rely on them now.

738
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:03,810
I'll see you later then.

739
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,110
Hey, guys. Wake up.

740
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:43,250
I'm up. What is it?
Where are they?

741
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,860
Why isn't Dong-cheol here yet?

742
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:02,170
Could that guy possibly have

743
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:03,900
changed Dong-cheol's mind?

744
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,000
Don't say that.

745
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,210
Dong-cheol wouldn't let us down.

746
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,380
I know Dong-cheol

747
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,610
will show up.

748
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,620
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

749
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,550
The early morning air sure is nice.

750
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,720
Yes, the morning air is full of
Almighty's blessings.

751
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,890
It's summer, but the early morning air
still seems a bit cool.

752
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,030
You'll catch a cold.
Why don't you hurry on into the car?

753
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,800
(IF POSSIBLE, DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
TRY TO STAY HOME.)

754
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,810
Wait a minute.

755
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,810
Do you mind if I stay home
and get some rest today?

756
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,420
-Why?
-I'm not feeling well.

757
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,120
I think I have a cold.

758
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,990
I would like to skip
early morning service today.

759
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,960
Then why don't you rest
at Guseonwon?

760
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:06,000
Our future Spiritual Mother has been
in a spiritually clean place.

761
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,100
You're sick
because you're in a dirty environment.

762
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,900
I get headaches just by
leaving Guseonwon.

763
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:14,870
She's right. Go have a glass of
warm life-giving water and get some rest.

764
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,680
We'll be late and miss the words
of blessings. We should go.

765
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,950
She's right.

766
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,390
Sang-hwan.

767
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,600
Are you going to keep
waiting for Dong-cheol?

768
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,670
Let's just go.

769
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,810
You'll be able to be with
your mother again, so don't feel anxious.

770
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,950
Excuse me?

771
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,920
Apostle Im must not have told you yet.

772
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,890
Spiritual Father wants you to return
to Guseonwon starting from today.

773
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:10,230
It's good news. Spiritual Father has made
an exception for you.

774
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,200
Dad. What are you talking about?

775
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,040
What do you mean we're moving back?
What about our belongings?

776
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,910
Don't you worry. Our brethren
will be bringing everything for you.

777
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,980
Sang-mi, what's that look on your face?

778
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,180
Isn't this what you've been wanting?

779
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,650
Apostle Jo.

780
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,450
Yes?

781
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,490
Once she arrives at Guseonwon,

782
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,390
she'll be starting her training
to become our Spiritual Mother.

783
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,090
You shouldn't refer to her
as Sang-mi from now on.

784
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,160
Forgive me.

785
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:46,930
I'm so used to calling her Sang-mi.
I don't know what I was thinking.

786
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,130
(GUSEONWON)

787
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,120
Dong-cheol, where are you?

788
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,060
(They've packed all their belongings.)

789
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,960
-What?
(-They're taking away everything.)

790
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,270
(Sang-hwan, you have to stop
that van no matter what.)

791
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,300
All right. Don't worry.

792
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,910
I'll make sure I stop the van.

793
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:31,180
They found out what we're up to.
Hold on tight.

794
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,300
Gosh.

795
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,480
-Are you guys ready?
-I'm the son of a cop.

796
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,810
I'm on a wrestling team.

797
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:06,650
Let's go.

798
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,090
They're the evil spirits.

799
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,560
They're here to dare take away
what belongs to Almighty.

800
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,930
Do you know what the most effective
miracle drug is for evil spirits is?

801
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,000
It's this right here.

802
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,600
They need a beating until near death
to know who they're dealing with.

803
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,270
Shall we?

804
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,610
(GUSEONWON)

805
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,020
I'll save you.

806
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,740
(SAVE ME)

807
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:14,050
Evidence?

808
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,750
Do you think they're fools
to leave behind evidence?

809
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,750
Even if we do find something,

810
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:22,220
it'll be useless.

811
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,160
What are you talking about?

812
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,220
If you're rich and have
strong connections,

813
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,390
you can make an innocent person guilty.

814
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,030
That's what happened back then,

815
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,130
isn't that right?

816
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,370
That won't happen again.

817
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,910
Trust me.
