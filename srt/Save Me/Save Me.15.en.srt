(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,270
(Please help me
accept you with all of my heart.)

3
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,100
(I need just a little more time.)

4
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,140
(Until the day the fruit will ripen
to perfection,)

5
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,740
I will wait.

6
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,040
(You should never swallow the pills
Apostle Kang gives you from now on.)

7
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,580
(Listen to me if you want
to save Sang-mi.)

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,280
(I feel like there are so many devils
in this place these days.)

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,380
Shove her head in there.

10
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,250
(Oh, yes. I remember now.)

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,620
(That place is being broadcasted
on the internet these days.)

12
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,290
(What do you mean?)

13
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,720
(Oh, you used to go to a church
in Daegu that just got broadcasted?)

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,130
(I bet you're now realizing
whom you guys were messing with.)

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,060
(I think they caught Jeong-hun
and took him there.)

16
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,000
I think we should test Sang-mi

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,740
(if she's truly capable of becoming)

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,200
(our Spiritual Mother.)

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,539
With the fire of our Almighty

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,180
With his hot fire

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,950
Hong So-rin.

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,180
I look forward to working with you.

23
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:33,960
(If you go that way into the forest,)

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,759
(you'll get to a stream
with a small bridge.)

25
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,830
(You can meet my friend there
and get help from him.)

(EPISODE 15)

27
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,470
Almighty must love me very much.

28
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,210
I mean, who thought
I would run into you right here?

29
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,210
Aren't I right,
Reporter Hong So-rin?

30
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,350
No! Please forgive me.

31
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,920
Please don't

32
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,690
Gosh Don't kill me.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
Please don't kill me!

34
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,390
No! Please don't!

35
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,940
Why did you sneak into
Guseonwon to begin with?

36
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,570
You graduated from a good university
and became a reporter.

37
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,480
If your parents see this,
their hearts will shatter to pieces.

38
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,010
Aren't I right?

39
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,490
I hope you go to the paradise
and gain salvation, Ms. Reporter.

40
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,280
(Dong-cheol, I just got here,)

41
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,680
(but that reporter isn't here.
Something must have happened to her.)

42
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,620
(I'll file a missing person report.)

43
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,589
(If I report her missing,
those jerks will try to bury it again.)

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,330
(It might actually give us
a chance to catch them.)

45
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,100
Hello?

46
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,770
(Sang...)

47
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,770
(Hwan...)

48
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,770
Mom?

49
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,680
(It's your mom.)

50
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,430
Are you sure that Reporter Hong
escaped safely?

51
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,200
Yes, but I'm worried

52
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,230
because it seems like
she didn't meet Sang-hwan yet.

53
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,370
For now, let's wait until he calls us.

54
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,030
Excuse me.

55
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,140
Spiritual Mother,

56
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,010
did you see Apostle Kang today?

57
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,940
What is the matter?

58
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
She's supposed to be leading
the vigil today.

59
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,210
But she doesn't seem to be here.

60
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,120
I'll be doing it today.

61
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,140
As you all know,

62
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,340
for the last three years,

63
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,810
I was a sinner.

64
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,310
I showed hatred

65
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,350
for the Almighty and the Spiritual Father

66
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,850
in front of you.

67
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,950
-However,
(-Jo Wan-tae isn't here.)

68
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,320
the Almighty and the Spiritual Father

69
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,659
(-Did he...)
-They chose me

70
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,390
as the Spiritual Mother of Guseonwon.

71
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,730
Brothers and Sisters of Guseonwon,

72
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,200
thanks to the Almighty
and the Spiritual Father,

73
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,610
I have become a whole new person.

74
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,280
I am so happy right now.

75
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,120
(He's wearing something different.)

76
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,050
(It's different.)

77
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,590
When I think of meeting the Almighty

78
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,460
next to the Spiritual Father
as the Spiritual Mother,.

79
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,390
my heart feels so warm

80
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,800
that I don't know what to do about it.

81
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,500
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

82
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,370
-We believe it.
-We believe it.

83
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,040
Do you believe that I am the scapegoat

84
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,410
that will help you
get rid of your original sin?

85
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,880
-We believe it.
-We believe it.

86
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,780
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

87
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,950
In that case,

88
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,920
let's give a big round of applause
of gratefulness

89
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,250
to the Almighty and the Spiritual Father

90
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,220
who have blessed everyone here with grace.

91
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,340
(I need to check what he was up to.)

92
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,250
Man-hui, how is Jeong-hun?

93
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,190
(Fortunately, he's fine.)

94
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,790
(I got the medical certificates
as evidence.)

95
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,690
(I'll go to the police station
tomorrow with him.)

96
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,460
All right.
Take good care of him today.

97
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,860
See you at the police station tomorrow.

98
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,460
(All right.)

99
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,530
Bye.

100
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,870
If we make it a big hospital
with a sanatorium,

101
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,840
people will welcome it
and stop opposing it.

102
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,440
This is probably
what Baek Jeong-gi wanted.

103
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,280
If we use him wisely,

104
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,549
we will be competitive with
the henchman and Senator Park,

105
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,179
and we will get a better chance
at earning more votes.

106
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,590
And I think it would be better

107
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,920
to move your wife.

108
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,290
What do you mean?

109
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,700
It seems like Sang-hwan has
made a big fuss at Guseonwon.

110
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,470
They called us.

111
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,800
And it seems like
he's been going to the police

112
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,140
and working with Detective Lee.

113
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,610
Really? I must have overlooked my son,

114
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,040
thinking he was too young to do anything.

115
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,480
If we get a hold of your wife,

116
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,450
Sang-hwan won't be able
to do anything much.

117
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,850
Mom. Mom.

118
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,590
Mom.

119
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,060
Mom. Did you move by yourself?

120
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,680
Your father...

121
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,220
Where is he?

122
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,060
Man-hui.

123
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,290
I need to ask you a favor.

124
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,000
(You just need to help me take my mom
out of the hospital room)

125
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,970
(and take her to my uncle's.)

126
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,540
Okay, I will be there.

127
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,770
See you later.

128
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,770
What? Is there a problem?

129
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,680
I need to go outside for a moment.

130
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,850
Do you have time to watch over him
until I come back?

131
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,250
I'm late for work.

132
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,020
We're only disturbing him
by making noises here.

133
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,990
Let him sleep well.

134
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,790
Let's leave him to rest alone.

135
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,760
Okay.

136
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
Spiritual Mother.

137
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,350
Why

138
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,920
are you cleaning this room?

139
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,490
Apostle Jo asked us to clean this room.

140
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,400
Excuse me.

141
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,470
Yes?

142
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,070
Apostle Kang is looking for you.

143
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,570
It's all right. You should go.

144
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,210
It seemed urgent.

145
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,280
In that case, we'll be right back.

146
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,610
Yes.

147
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,600
Did he find her?

148
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,030
I think

149
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,400
something must have happened.

150
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,000
It was like this

151
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,640
when Jeong-gu died.

152
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,040
They cleaned his room afterwards.

153
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,980
Killing someone

154
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,950
is no big deal for these people.

155

(MUJI DAILY)

156
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,870
(Sang-hwan, I think something
must have happened to the reporter.)

157
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,120
(I'm at Muji Daily.)

158
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,550
(I'll check right away.)

159
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,970
This is what he was wearing
in the morning.

160
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,550
(What is this?)

161
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,950
(KARAOKE BAR, BIXIE)

162
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,820
It's wet.

163
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,430
He did change his clothes.

164
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,060
If you go over the mountain,

165
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,130
you'll find a river with a bridge.

166
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,200
The river.

167
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,370
You really didn't get any calls
from Reporter Hong?

168
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,410
No.

169
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,340
But what is this about?

170
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,380
I know everything.

171
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,750
She escaped from Guseonwon,
and she was going to meet me.

172
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,150
But I can neither find her nor call her.

173
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,420
Is this true?

174
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,960
We need to report her to the police
as a missing person.

175
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,430
The chief of police and Guseonwon

176
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,460
have joined hands,
so they might not process it.

177
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,030
Then write an article about her
going missing after infiltrating

178
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,900
a religious cult undercover
to do a story on them.

179
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,370
The police chief and Guseonwon
have joined hands?

180
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,500
He's not the only one.

181
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,410
My dad too. Everyone is connected.

182
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,540
You mean Governor Han?

183
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,250
Will you really be able
to disclose all this?

184
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,760
You're basically strangling
your father with your own hands.

185
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,460
If I tell you

186
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,170
that I can't do it,

187
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,540
will you be able to bury the truth
fully knowing it?

188
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,190
Hey, Man-hui.

189
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,790
What did you say?

190
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,720
(KARAOKE BAR, BIXIE)

191
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,400
Where's your mind at these days?

192
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,000
Go back to Seoul if you'll keep this up.

193
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,270
What did you do to Mom?

194
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,240
How dare you glare at me like that?

195
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,410
I moved her to a better hospital.

196
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,210
-I was worried about her, so--
-Worried?

197
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,420
Dad.

198
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,780
Do you know what this is?

199
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,190
That's your mom's voice recorder.

200
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,089
That's right.

201
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,829
Why did you bring it?

202
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,260
I must say, you've said
so many things to her.

203
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,400
Remember when I pushed you?

204
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,569
Do you know how it made me feel?

205
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,580
The thrill you get
when you slaughter an animal.

206
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,150
That's when I realized how much I really

207
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,050
hate you.

208
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,950
Dad.

209
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,160
You've done horrible things to Mom,

210
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,860
and you're such a cruel person.

211
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,700
I'll tell the whole world about it.

212
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,130
Sang-hwan.

213
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,600
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

214
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,940
Misunderstanding?

215
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,340
How can you lie to me again
when there's evidence right here?

216
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,110
Give me that.

217
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,850
No.

218
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,080
Dad.

219
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,720
Don't forget everything you have done

220
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,920
because you'll have
to pay for all of them.

221
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,360
Sang-hwan!

222
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,860
Will you really corner me like this?

223
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,010
Mr. Han.

224
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,510
How can this be happening?

225
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,890
If Sang-hwan finds out
that we're keeping his mom,

226
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,460
he won't be

227
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,520
able to disclose it.

228
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,790
After all this time...

229
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,970
That voice recording
must not be disclosed.

230
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,470
Ji-hui.

231
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,670
Yes.

232
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,440
You and I are on the same boat, you know.

233
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,150
If they take me down,
you'll go down with me.

234
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,380
You got that?

235
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,690
Yes, Mr. Han.

236
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,890
Chief Lee, I need you
to unleash your hound.

237
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,660
Whom do you need to hunt down?

238
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,000
Han Sang-hwan.

239
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,970
My son.

240
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Pardon?

241
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,620
Hello, are you looking for someone?

242
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,190
Oh, did Mr. Jo leave anything here?

243
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
Mr. Jo? Who is that?

244
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,030
Mr. Jo Wan-tae.

245
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,700
-Oh, Wan-tae.
-Yes.

246
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,170
He didn't leave anything here.

247
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,040
That's weird. He told me that
he left his wallet here earlier

248
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,440
and asked me to pick it up.

249
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,540
He is a regular here,

250
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,310
but he didn't come today.

251
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,150
I guess he's becoming forgetful
because he's been drinking a lot.

252
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,250
-Sorry to bother you. Take care.
-Wait!

253
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,860
Gosh, you're pretty cute.
You should stay for a drink.

254
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,620
I'll come with Mr. Jo another time.

255
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,490
-I'm sorry.
-Will you do that?

256
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,330
(BIXIE)

257
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,220
Sang-hwan,

258
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,450
(I know that you're looking
for your mom.)

259
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,450
Give us that voice recorder.

260
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,760
(Then you can meet your mom
right away.)

261
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,430
Listen. If you lay
even a finger on my mom,

262
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,330
I'll teach you a lesson.
You got that?

263
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,070
Hey there, prince.

264
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,340
Come on. I think we have
some business to take care of.

265
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,880
Get out of my way.

266
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,980
If you get on my nerves now,
I'll make you regret it.

267
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,650
Just give me that voice recorder,
and you won't have to see me again.

268
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,720
I told you to get out of my way.

269
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,950
You little...

270
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,630
I have to take this to make
some money off of it, okay?

271
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,600
Sang-hwan!

272
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,070
Sang-hwan, are you okay?

273
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,960
By any chance, did you hear
to which hospital my mom was

274
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,390
being transferred
when she was checking out?

275
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,330
Mr. Han's secretary said that
the order came from him,

276
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,930
so we just did it for her.

277
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,470
We don't know anything else.

278
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,480
Sang-hwan.

279
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm trying to get elected
as governor again

280
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,020
for your mom.

281
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,820
If I become the governor,

282
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,320
your mother will wake up again.

283
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,490
Three years ago,

284
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,730
I made a wrong choice
because of my mom.

285
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,730
And I couldn't help

286
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,900
Sang-mi

287
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,840
or Dong-cheol.

288
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,140
I don't want

289
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,510
to regret the same thing again.

290
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,780
First,

291
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,880
we need to go to the police
and Guseonwon.

292
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,520
Yes.

293
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,080
Hello.

294
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,030
If you're listening to this,
you must have

295
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,170
done something you shouldn't have.

296
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,970
Father, I have trusted you until the end.

297
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,640
But now I know

298
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,980
that a wrong trust can be dangerous.

299
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,750
Now I know exactly how

300
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,380
it can hurt so many people.

301
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,620
You shouldn't do this.

302
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,060
It's too late.
You should come back tomorrow.

303
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,420
I need to see someone.

304
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,790
Gosh, how dare you!

305
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,230
I said you can't come here.

306
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,330
Let me go.

307
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,570
You two should go now.

308
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,800
But, Spiritual Father...

309
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,040
It's all right.

310
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,110
I have Apostle Im by my side.

311
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,510
-Yes.
-Yes.

312
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,350
Come in.

313
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,520
Sergeant Woo is like a father to me.

314
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,790
When I was young,
my father died in a car accident,

315
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,830
and I lived with my sick mother.

316
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,230
And he even paid for
my university tuition fees.

317
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,030
Is that so?

318
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,640
You must be grateful.

319
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,470
Don't you think so too?

320
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:49,480
Yes, Sergeant Woo has a pure heart.

321
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,650
That must be why he was chosen
by the Almighty.

322
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,420
You are all crazy.

323
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,360
Pastor Baek, you must know very well
what I am talking about.

324
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,190
If you take advantage of him
again like this,

325
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,330
I won't let it slide.

326
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,660
Do you understand?

327
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,830
Officer Choe,

328
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,240
there must be a misunderstanding.

329
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,270
A misunderstanding?

330
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,240
Apostle Im,

331
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,080
please give us some space.

332
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,410
Of course.

333
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,930
I know that there are dozens of

334
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,970
homeless people
that Sergeant Woo is taking care of.

335
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,580
Do you think it would be okay

336
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,850
if a father-figure like him gets hurt
because of you?

337
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,350
What?

338
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,020
Do you think that's all?

339
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,520
His son and wife would be so shocked.

340
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,330
Do you think that Sergeant Woo

341
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,260
and his family would be

342
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,130
able to withstand the criticism
of the world?

343
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
What if

344
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,940
he makes the wrong choice?

345
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,180
Do you think you will be able to

346
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,580
cope with all of this?

347
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,560
(POLICE)

348
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,240
If you really think of him
as your father,

349
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,110
you should go home quietly.

350
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,840
That's the only way you can repay him

351
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,850
for what he has done for you.

352
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,020
It's all right.

353
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,620
Lift your head, and look at me.

354
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,030
Now.

355
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,870
You will be

356
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,110
of great use to the Almighty.

357
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,410
If you listen to me carefully

358
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,450
and finish this job well,

359
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,420
you can get out

360
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,750
and go to paradise.

361
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,620
Do you understand?

362
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,790
I can

363
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,790
get out?

364
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,030
If you go outside, you will see the devil

365
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,770
in the form of a female police officer.

366
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,670
The devil.

367
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,980
Female police officer.

368
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,050
Devil. Female police officer.

369
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,510
Don't be afraid.

370
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,220
You just need to trust me.

371
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,890
Yes, Governor Han.
How have you been?

372
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,860
(Hello,)

373
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,100
you're the Spiritual Father, right?

374
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,000
Why did you call me
at such a late hour?

375
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,800
I came to pray at night,

376
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,740
and you came into my mind.

377
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,040
Really?

378
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,810
You must be so upset

379
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,920
because of the protests
from the villagers.

380
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,150
(The Almighty has told me)

381
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,960
to help you get rid of
such worries

382
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,030
during my prayer.

383
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,800
(Really?)

384
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,530
I heard that many of the villagers
who were protesting

385
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,600
were believers of Guseonwon.

386
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,240
It is my mission to lead
such believers well

387
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,380
in times like this.

388
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,310
Then how do you want me
to show my appreciation?

389
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,780
You crazy scum. Gosh.

390
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,160
I need a loyal guard that will be able

391
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,200
to protect the Almighty.

392
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,990
What is this?

393
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,100
There's a place called Guseonwon
far away from here.

394
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,330
You should go and stay there
until it gets quiet.

395
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,600
Did you say Guseonwon?

396
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,940
What? You know about it too?

397
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,470
There's a place called

398
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,540
Guseonwon 20 minutes away from town.

399
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,450
It's a great church.
You should come visit.

400
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,450
I'll make you a better person.

401
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,750
Do you want me to repent or something?

402
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,390
Don't do anything stupid and

403
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,320
watch someone called Baek Jeong-gi
until the governor gives orders.

404
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,730
Gosh, is the governor

405
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,000
trying to become
the master of everything?

406
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,430
Gosh, he is greedy.

407
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,370
Have you seen anyone who's not?

408
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,520
-Oh, my.
-Here.

409
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,410
Someone went missing.

410
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,780
Help me find her.

411
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,280
Who?

412
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,050
A woman called Hong So-rin.

413
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,320
-She's a reporter.
-A reporter?

414
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,320
Are you talking about
that reporter

415
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,720
who just got reported
missing by Muji Daily?

416
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,260
Yes.

417
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,460
Does she have something to do
with Guseonwon as well?

418
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,930
Her identity got revealed while
she was working undercover.

419
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,630
She was locked up,
but she managed to run away.

420
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,230
She went missing at Muji River

421
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,930
that's near Guseonwon.

422
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,180
I'm going to start investigating
Guseonwon tomorrow morning.

423
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,850
Really?

424
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:44,280
So come with your friend tomorrow,
and tell me where

425
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,420
-your friend was locked up.
-Okay.

426
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,990
Just a second.

427
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,030
(Dong-cheol, we need to meet right now.)

428
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,300
Dong-cheol. Dong-cheol.

429
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,700
The police and I are going to that place
where Jeong-hun was locked up.

430
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,780
Jeong-hun told me that there
were other people locked up there.

431
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,840
He even saw some people die there too.

432
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,650
But they might expect Jeong-hun
to tell everything to the police.

433
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,679
Do you think they still keep them there?

434
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,889
You're right.
I'm kind of worried about that.

435
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:21,489
If you fail to catch them tomorrow,

436
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,620
I'll just reveal my identity
and get locked up myself.

437
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,590
Then I'll try to look for other
people who got locked up.

438
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,560
-That's too dangerous.
-We have no other choice now.

439
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,929
We have to do this.

440
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,770
I don't even know what's going
on inside Sang-mi's head anymore.

441
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,540
Jeong-hun.

442
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,239
What brings you here?

443
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,679
Did my dad go somewhere?

444
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,179
He's out on patrol.
Is he not answering his phone?

445
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,690
No, I just came in
while I was passing by.

446
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,960
I'm glad you're here. Stay here
until I come back from the bathroom.

447
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,890
Okay.

448
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,240
My mom's birthday.

449
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,880
My birthday?

450
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,160
My goodness.

451
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,590
What are you doing here?

452
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,630
I just came by.

453
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,670
Why didn't you answer my calls?
Where are you?

454
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,820
Jeong-hun, you should go home first.

455
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,420
(If you want to know where
that reporter went,)

456
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,560
(come look for me quietly.)

457
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,700
Are you okay now?

458
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,170
You're in this with them,
aren't you?

459
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,210
No, I'm not in this with anyone.
They're just my friends.

460
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,610
What do you want?

461
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,850
Why do you keep trying
to get in our way?

462
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,820
Do you really believe that
Spiritual Father leads you to paradise?

463
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,950
Or do you just wish to believe so?

464
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,330
The believers here told me that

465
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,400
you also once sacrificed

466
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,930
your daughter into becoming
the Spiritual Mother.

467
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,530
Did your daughter also tell you

468
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,070
that Spiritual Father was real?

469
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,280
-What do you know?
-If you

470
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,010
really believe that Spiritual Father
leads you to paradise,

471
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,610
you can go ahead, and tell him
about my identity.

472
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,720
But if you wish to see

473
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,750
if he's real or fake,

474
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,620
you should sit back and watch.

475
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,890
Because we're going to reveal

476
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,860
that he's fake.

477
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,540
I'm sure the Almighty will

478
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,210
cleanse this place.

479
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,050
Right?

480
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,350
You're going to burn all the bad sins

481
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,750
of this place

482
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,790
with your hot fire,

483
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,860
and make it into a brand new place, right?

484
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,360
Am I right?

485
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,150
Yeong-hui.

486
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,650
Yeong-hui, listen to me.

487
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,850
I think you're mistaken.

488
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,130
-Yeong-hui.
-Why did you do this?

489
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,430
You said I should be careful of
what I eat.

490
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,670
No, that's not it.

491
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,970
Mr. Woo.

492
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,340
-You should just confess.
-Yeong-hui, let me explain.

493
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,510
I didn't do it on purpose.

494
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,780
I just kind of got myself
involved unknowingly.

495
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,380
Yeong-hui, watch out!

496
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,290
Mr. Woo!

497
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,720
You devil!

498
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,800
You must die

499
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,160
-in order for us to go to paradise.
-Mr. Woo.

500
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,130
Are you okay?
Please wait a little bit.

501
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,900
I might as well just
break everything into pieces.

502
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,540
Dad.

503
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,850
Dad. Dad.

504
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,450
What What happened?

505
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,820
Don't worry. Fortunately,
he didn't get severely injured.

506
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,390
They said he's good to go.

507
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,960
Are you okay, Dad?

508
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,430
Can you excuse us for a while?

509
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,370
Sit down.

510
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,080
Jeong-hun.

511
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,280
You're not going to

512
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,890
hate me, right?

513
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,120
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

514
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,890
Jeong-hun.

515
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,400
I want you to

516
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,770
listen carefully to what
I'm about to tell you.

517
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,140
Well...

518
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,840
He's the one who entered our property
without permission.

519
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,470
Doesn't that make us the victims?

520
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,810
Yes, you can report him.
He'll have to pay a fine.

521
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,410
Chief, there's nothing here.

522
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
-What?
-I think

523
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,050
he came in here out of curiosity
and just lied

524
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,450
because he thought he wouldn't be able
to get out of it.

525
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,990
What? I saw it with my own two eyes.

526
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,730
Hey!

527
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,560
It was built during the Korean War.
We're using it as a warehouse.

528
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,530
How many times must I tell you
that there's nothing here?

529
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,830
Why can't you trust me?

530
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,820
Did you find what you were looking for?

531
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,990
I guess there was a misunderstanding.

532
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,620
I'm sorry to have caused a fuss
from so early in the morning.

533
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,760
How strange.

534
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,930
We have nothing against you.

535
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,700
But you seem to disagree with
our religion,

536
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,270
and you keep trying to defame us.

537
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,710
From what I know, you even

538
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,280
secretly came in here once before.

539
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,480
I came in because this place
smelled nasty.

540
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,650
Hey.

541
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,380
If you keep doing this,

542
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,490
we're no longer just going
to sit back and watch.

543
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,190
Why? Are you going to kidnap me
and lock me up?

544
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,590
-What did you say?
-I'll forgive you.

545
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,160
So please leave.

546
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,770
This is how generous he is.

547
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,540
He forgives everyone for everything.

548
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:03,940
"Forgive"?

549
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
I never asked you for your forgiveness.

550
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,710
Chief, these guys are all lying right now.

551
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,580
They're all in this together!

552
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,780
Stop it. That's enough.

553
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,220
My gosh.

554
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,380
Hey.

555
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,150
You shouldn't do this.

556
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,220
Please leave.

557
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,140
(SPIRITUAL FATHER'S ROOM)

558
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,080
Yes, come in.

559
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:08,170
Don't just stand there.
Please sit down.

560
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,940
From now on, you and Dong-cheol

561
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,480
will stay by my side and guard me.

562
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,120
-Pardon?
-It is your duty

563
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,020
to act as gatekeeper of paradise.

564
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,520
Okay.

565
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,760
What are you doing right now?

566
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,870
Do you have a problem with

567
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,770
what our Almighty wishes to do?

568
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,820
What are you doing?

569
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,650
I'm gatekeeping.

570
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,990
My gosh, this is ridiculous.

571
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,970
I'll see you again, Mr. Gatekeeper.

572
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,940
Mr. Gatekeeper, Mr. Gatekeeper

573
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,110
I can't believe this.

574
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,150
See?

575
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,820
He may have met our Almighty
long before you,

576
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,920
but if you fail to pray diligently,

577
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,320
your heart will be filled with distrust

578
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:39,090
and arrogance like him.

579
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,460
Both of you will be able to get
on the first class seats

580
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,330
of the Boat of Salvation on
the Day of Salvation.

581
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,700
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

582
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,480
What's going on?

583
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,590
I don't know what
the governor's hiding here,

584
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,160
but he asked me to stay here,
and keep an eye on him.

585
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,600
Sang-hwan's dad asked you
to come here?

586
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,670
But I heard he asked the governor

587
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,830
to send him someone to guard him.

588
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,540
That means he doesn't trust anyone here.

589
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,910
I can already sense that
Jo Wan-tae has done

590
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,550
some dirty deeds.

591
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,750
They're all just similar people
fighting for similar things.

592
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,220
-Jo Wan-tae?
-Yes.

593
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,050
How do you know him?

594
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,590
I saw him once at a karaoke bar.

595
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,690
("Karaoke bar"?)

596
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,460
Jun-gu.

597
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,060
I'm pretty sure you already know,

598
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,570
but this isn't an ordinary church.

599
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,140
You should be careful.

600
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,450
(KARAOKE BAR, BIXIE)

601
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,890
(I wonder when he's going to
go here again.)

602
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,060
Apostle Jo.

603
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,900
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

604
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,300
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

605
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,070
Shouldn't you be
by Spiritual Father's side?

606
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,570
I just got really worried.

607
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,540
I heard that the police might do
an open search on Guseonwon

608
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,150
because Hong So-rin suddenly disappeared.

609
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:43,820
This place is special, so they won't
be able to enter without permission.

610
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,920
So don't worry.

611
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,290
By the way,
I'm not going to be back tonight.

612
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,430
So call me if you need me for anything.

613
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:54,560
Okay?

614
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,700
(It must be today.)

615
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,300
Oh, okay.

616
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,500
Drive safely.

617
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,770
Okay.

618
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,850
(I think he's going to Bixie right now.)

619
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,950
(I THINK HE IS GOING TO BIXIE RIGHT NOW.)

620
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,750
He's really here.

621
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,920
I'm glad we listened to Dong-cheol
and waited here for him.

622
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,990
My gosh, do you think we'll be okay?

623
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,260
When did we ever think about that
before we did anything?

624
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,600
Let's begin.

625
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,810
Hello? Dong-cheol?

626
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:43,880
What do you think?

627
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,810
I'm here to spread the honor and
glory of our Almighty.

628
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,580
Why did you call?
The Spiritual Father?

629
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,550
Why does he want to see me?

630
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,460
I'll call you later.

631
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:01,730
Are you Jo Wan-tae?

632
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:07,330
The police are going to investigate
Guseonwon soon.

633
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,600
That means you won't be able
to walk around like this for long.

634
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:19,110
You must be acting up

635
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,180
Do you think things will go your way?

636
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,680
Guseonwon was built on a special
land that was chosen by Almighty.

637
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,950
How many times must I tell you
that it's not a place

638
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,760
where you can enter without permission?

639
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,320
I think things will go my way.

640
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,890
The police told me so.

641
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,630
You should talk more politely
for someone who's younger than me.

642
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,970
Do you think the police will even
be able to find anything?

643
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:42,570
You already checked with the police
that there's nothing strange there.

644
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,870
If we

645
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,370
find the person you murdered,

646
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,110
the story will unfold differently.

647
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,680
-What?
-I already know that

648
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,910
you were at Muji River last night.

649
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,550
I also know that you met
Reporter Hong So-rin there.

650
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,450
You took her into Muji River
and killed her,

651
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,160
didn't you?

652
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,260
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

653
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,600
I know you weren't

654
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,000
in Guseonwon at that hour.

655
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,930
The clothes you were wearing

656
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,100
were also wet in muddy water.

657
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,910
I heard they found Reporter Hong's
shoe at Muji River.

658
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:22,610
Thankfully,

659
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:26,580
we have a witness, so we've already
recorded that person's testimony.

660
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,780
As soon as the police investigates
and finds her body,

661
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,380
I'll be able to send you to prison.

662
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,490
Really? Then I guess

663
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,390
I should check that recording.

664
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:46,170
You foolish scum.

665
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,030
I even killed Hong So-rin.

666
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,570
Killing you will be a piece of cake.

667
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,910
Let's hear that witness' testimony.
Let me hear it.

668
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,810
Come here.

669
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,510
These rats...

670
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,050
You little...

671
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,350
You pieces of How dare you!

672
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,160
Hey, you guys. Break it up.

673
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,260
Stop.

674
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:15,730
You punks.

675
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,800
What do you mean I killed someone?
Me?

676
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,140
Whom did I kill? You saw everything.

677
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,410
All three of these punks came at me.

678
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,450
They randomly accused me of killing
someone and started beating me up.

679
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,580
Chief, you know

680
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,550
that I believe Almighty.
How can I kill anyone?

681
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,990
(I even killed Hong So-rin.
Killing you will be a piece of cake.)

682
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,960
(You punk. I'll teach you a lesson.)

683
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,500
I lied to him and said that I have
a recording of a witness statement,

684
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,230
but he tried to kill me
as soon as he heard it.

685
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,970
And whether we assaulted him
or acted in self-defense

686
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,740
will become clear if you watch
the CCTV footage from that camera.

687
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,710
-Arrest him.
-Yes, sir.

688
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,380
Chief, I can explain...

689
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,010
Gosh, what are you doing?

690
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,980
I'll recite your Miranda rights.

691
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,020
-You have the right to remain
-You scum.

692
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,380
You have the right to remain silent.

693
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,690
How dare you tell me to keep still?
You punk. If I catch you, I'll...

694
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,820
-Hey, Han Sang-hwan!
-Guys, bring him to the car.

695
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,590
-Yes, sir.
-Why are you doing this to me?

696
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,130
I really didn't do anything!

697
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:23,430
I'll be sure to teach you punks a lesson.
How dare you!

698
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,860
-Shut it, and get in the car.
-I really didn't do it!

699
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,730
I did nothing wrong! Darn it!

700
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:03,400
We have a recording of your confession
to killing Hong So-rin.

701
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,740
You were also behind
Officer Choe getting stabbed.

702
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,440
I heard you paid
the homeless guy to do it.

703
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,580
Why did you do that?

704
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,350
What? Stab whom?

705
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:15,510
He confessed to us
that you asked him to do it.

706
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,780
I asked him to do it?

707
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,560
Baek Jeong-gi, that piece of...

708
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,490
Mr. Jo.

709
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,800
Let's not waste our energy like this.

710
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,600
Let me use the washroom.

711
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:38,370
It looks like this will take a long time.
Aren't I right?

712
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,290
Jo Wan-tae just got arrested.

713
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,790
Seriously?

714
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,560
Then is he the one

715
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,230
who killed Reporter Hong?

716
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,700
Listen to me carefully.

717
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,570
Go to the cult leader,
and tell him who I really am.

718
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,870
-What?
-This is the only way we can

719
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,740
shake that place upside down.

720
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,240
What on earth are you thinking?

721
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:18,240
If he finds out
that I'm Sang-hwan's friend,

722
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:22,250
he'll lock me up in the basement storage
with other people.

723
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:25,720
Those people who disappeared today
are the most crucial evidence.

724
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,160
You need to blow my cover in order
for us to bring the truth to light.

725
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,860
You have to do it to gain his full trust.

726
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,500
I can't do that.

727
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,330
It'll be too dangerous for you.

728
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,930
I'll go down there.

729
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,800
Don't. I'll do my very best,

730
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,770
so you should do your best too.

731
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:51,110
Dong-cheol.

732
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:57,180
I'll do what you asked me to do,
but you have to do me a favor too.

733
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:01,620
I'll have

734
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,160
a spiritual wedding with him.

735
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,430
What?

736
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:09,390
I'll record everything that
disgusting jerk does to have me.

737
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,960
It's the most solid evidence we can get.

738
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,230
-Sang-mi.
-Baek Jeong-gi, that scum.

739
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,270
He let me go once, but he absolutely
won't give up this time.

740
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,840
I know that he'll try to have me

741
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,870
at all costs.

742
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,510
-Have you lost your mind?
-No.

743
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:28,310
I'm totally sane.

744
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,480
I finally have a clear idea

745
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,950
of what I can do to take him down.

746
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,460
You guys should come to where I am.

747
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,760
Just before he gets

748
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,160
what he wants,
barge in and save me.

749
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,770
Do you really have to do this?

750
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,470
I came back here because

751
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,670
I no longer

752
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,040
want to fear them

753
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,510
or run away from them.

754
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,320
I plan to destroy
this place with my own hands

755
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,020
so that I can save Sang-jin, Mom,

756
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,790
and Dad who's lost his mind
because of those scoundrels.

757
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,690
I will

758
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,200
save them at all costs.

759
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,620
-Detective.
-What?

760
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,190
I can't unzip my pants
because of these cuffs.

761
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,790
Please help me out here.

762
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,610
Hey, get him!

763
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,150
That rat!

764
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,920
Don't let him get away!

765
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,120
Get him!

766
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,690
Hurry!

767
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,520
Hey, stop right there!

768
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:21,990
-Get him!
-Gosh!

769
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,300
Hey!

770
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,130
That crazy jerk.

771
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,500
Stop right there!

772
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,240
It's here.

773
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:42,880
Why are you so dressed up?
I told you to wear something comfortable.

774
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,150
I had no idea there was
a place like this here.

775
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,420
This is the paradise,
the true paradise.

776
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,790
Yes, totally.

777
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,560
Here, all of your pain
and loneliness will go away

778
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,630
because Spiritual Father will heal you.

779
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,200
-That's right.
-Oh, really?

780
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,200
-Let's go in.
-Okay, let's go.

781
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,130
(GUSEONWON)

782
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,370
-Hello.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

783
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,810
You must know it too.

784
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,580
Evil energy started to fill up this place.

785
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:21,890
If we don't purify ourselves
of this evil energy soon,

786
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,520
the Boat of Salvation

787
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,890
might sink.

788
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,730
-Pardon me?
-If that happens,

789
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,430
Sang-jin, Sang-mi,

790
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,470
and your wife

791
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,070
won't be able

792
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,810
to reach the paradise.

793
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,940
Well... Spiritual Father.

794
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,480
Is there any way we can prevent it?

795
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,720
After the morning service tomorrow,

796
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,590
Sang-mi and I

797
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:57,590
will have our spiritual wedding.

798
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,430
Okay.

799
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,600
To stop the evil energy
from growing further,

800
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:09,570
you must

801
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,140
prepare for the spiritual wedding
as soon as possible.

802
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,910
Okay. Our wishes will be fulfilled.

803
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,690
Apostle Kang.

804
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,450
What did Spiritual Father

805
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:05,390
say to you?

806
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,630
He gave me a new revelation

807
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,930
in regards to the spiritual wedding.

808
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:14,530
By any chance,

809
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:16,870
did he say

810
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,370
that the Boat of Salvation might sink?

811
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,280
Apostle Kang.

812
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,780
Evil energy started
filling up this place.

813
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,550
If we don't purify ourselves
of this evil energy soon,

814
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,520
the Boat of Salvation might sink.

815
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,260
The spiritual wedding between Yu Ra and I

816
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,630
should be expedited.

817
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,170
Apostle Kang.

818
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:56,440
I'll take care of the preparation
from now on.

819
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,580
Please continue to pray
and help me out.

820
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,330
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

821
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:15,930
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

822
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,260
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

823
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:18,700
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

824
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,970
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

825
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:20,970
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

826
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,200
Sang-mi.

827
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,500
Come forward.

828
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,830
Now, the time is here.

829
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,070
Tomorrow at dawn,

830
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,210
you and I

831
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,480
will have a spiritual wedding

832
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:09,050
and become one.

833
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,420
I will be

834
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:16,820
at your service.

835
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,120
My savior.

836
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,790
My eternal life.

837
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:23,800
My

838
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,130
Spiritual Father.

839
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,320
(SAVE ME)

840
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:25,860
You use those who are powerless
to fulfill your ambitions.

841
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,130
You're just like the cult leader.

842
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,500
Both you and my dad

843
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,960
are exactly like that cult leader.

844
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,930
When you're a little older,
you'll realize

845
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:39,040
that there isn't much difference
between what's fake and real.

846
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,710
Is that how you lead your life?

847
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:44,180
I'll never live like that.

848
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,280
I told you to bring the voice recorder

849
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,710
if you want to see your mom.

850
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,520
I think

851
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,490
she misses you a lot.
