00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,140
(EPISODE 4)

3
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,460
Dong-cheol. Seok Dong-cheol!

4
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,400
Dong-cheol. Answer me.
Can't you hear me?

5
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,870
Dong-cheol!

6
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,800
Dong-cheol.

7
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,240
Stand tall.

8
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,940
I'll make sure...

9
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,180
Let go of me.

10
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,880
Dong-cheol! Stand tall!

11
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,950
Dong-cheol!

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,620
Forgive me.

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,250
I'm sorry, Dong-cheol.

14
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,060
Dong-cheol. Forgive me!

15
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,070
Medication won't make her better.

16
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,729
She needs a long-term hospitalization.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,640
Wait, a long-term hospitalization?

18
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,310
How long do you mean?

19
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,979
A condition like this

20
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,680
can take a few years to lifetime
to get better.

21
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,750
Why don't you get her admitted first?

22
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,190
Go!

23
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,760
Jeong-gu!

24
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,060
What are you doing over there?

25
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,800
Come here, and have
some soda and rice cake.

26
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,740
Soda?

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,470
That's right, we have soda.
Come on.

28
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,610
Soda. Soda!

29
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,780
Dad.

30
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,980
What are you going to do with Mom?

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,110
Sang-mi. If we go to the hospital,

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,150
they will try to lock her up
in the psychiatric ward.

33
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,920
I can never send her to that prison.

34
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,090
Even a normal person
would go crazy in there.

35
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,400
Then we should go to
a hospital in Seoul, and--

36
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,600
No. Hospitals can't help her.

37
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,670
Sang-mi, don't worry.

38
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,840
I will protect you and your mom

39
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,010
no matter what.

40
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,380

42
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,690
One more time!

43
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,360
(-We love Spiritual Father

47
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,010
Almighty.

48
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,580
I will live the way Almighty wishes.

49
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,820
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,019
Please do not let us
be blinded by lies

51
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,790
and fall into the fire pit
when we see you, Almighty.

52
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,830
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

53
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,700
Be careful.

54
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,710
You're here. Welcome.

55
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,810
Hello.

56
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,220
Hey, kid. What are you doing over there?

57
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,020
You followed them here, so come in.

58
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,890
Sang-jin?

59
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,330
Is Sang-jin here?

60
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,400
He's over there.

61
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,170
Sang-jin...

62
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
People in the world still

63
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,310
fight, hate, murder,
and despise each other

64
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,650
like Sodom and Gomorrah.

65
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,120
But we are going to wait
and prepare ourselves

66
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,090
for the day of salvation,

67
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,120
the day that we will see you, Almighty.

68
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,030
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

69
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,640
The Almighty who protects us
has descended.

70
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,610
The poor ones should
stop feeling sorrows.

71
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,820
Let us be in high spirits!

72
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,260
Please stay with us,

73
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,860
so we can be saved

74
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,970
in this evil world!

75
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,170
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

76
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,440
Almighty!

77
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,510
-Almighty!
-Almighty!

78
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,740
Almighty!

79
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,350
-Almighty!
-Almighty!

80
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,880
Almighty!

81
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,580
-Almighty!
-Almighty!

82
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,020
Please guide everyone
to the way to salvation.

83
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,890
Please give me the strength

84
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,860
to pray with these people forever

85
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,830
without a change of heart even if
I have to sacrifice everything.

86
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:31,270
Please help us enter
the world of Almighty.

87
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,980
Please stay with us.

88
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,280
Your son is here.

89
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,330
Mom, please stop now.
My arms are tired.

90
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
Is it you, Sang-jin?

91
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,610
Mom, I'm sorry that I left you.

92
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,920
You still have Dad and Sang-mi,

93
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,660
so put yourself together and eat well.

94
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,520
Sang-jin.

95
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,890
Sang-jin.

96
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,200
Mom.

97
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,370
I will be fine,

98
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,880
so don't worry about me.
Take care of yourself.

99
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,580
No, Sang-jin.

100
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,250
Don't go.

101
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,750
Sang-jin. Don't...

102
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,590
Don't...

103
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,990
Don't leave me, Sang-jin.

104
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,730
Mom, I have to go.

105
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,200
That man over there says
we have to get on the boat.

106
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,800
No. Sang-jin.

107
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,340
Sang-jin.

108
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,070
Sang-jin.

109
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,380
Sang-jin, don't leave me.

110
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,580
Mom. We'll see each other later.

111
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,720
No.

112
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,950
(Mom)

113
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,960
(-My dear mom)
-Sang-jin.

114
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,390
(I'm going to leave now.)

115
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,330
(Don't worry about me.)

116
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,940
(Please live a long, happy life.)

117
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,970
Sang-jin. Sang-jin.

118
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,980
Sang-jin.

119
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,250
Sang-jin.

120
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,760
-Sang-jin...
-Mom!

121
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,400
Honey! Honey, are you okay?

122
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,340
No.

123
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,170
Sang-jin...

124
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,540
I know that Sang-jin is not dead.

125
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,220
Sang-mi.

126
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,420
Sang-jin isn't dead, right?

127
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,220
Your brother is alive.

128
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,060
Tell me, Sang-mi.

129
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,660
Sang-jin is not dead, right?

130
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,330
Come on. Tell me. Say it, Sang-mi!

131
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,270
Sang-jin isn't dead!

132
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,570
-Mom.
-Say it, Sang-mi!

133
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,270
Honey. Honey, please.

134
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,310
Stop. Don't be like this, please.

135
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,040
Honey, you saw him too.

136
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,820
You saw Sang-jin at home too.
I know you saw him!

137
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,590
Honey,
please pull yourself together!

138
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,490
I know you saw him at home too.

139
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,160
You saw him! Sang-jin...

140
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,460
Honey!

141
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,830
Sang-jin is not dead.

142
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,300
He's alive. You saw him.

143
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,790
A tough one has latched
onto your wife.

144
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,730
Is it my son by any chance?

145
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,760
No, it's not your son.

146
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,260
Then who's...

147
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,400
It's a spirit with an extremely
nasty temper.

148
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,340
I'll be

149
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,210
in touch after picking
the best day next month.

150
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,110
Let's give it another try then.

151
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,580
And take this.

152
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,850
Make sure it's kept inside her underwear,
but she shouldn't find out.

153
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,750
You have to do it in order to
make sure your wife and daughter

154
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,750
don't follow your son
to the other side.

155
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,400
Oh, and

156
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,200
don't forget to send me
another big check by the end of tomorrow.

157
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,740
Wait, sir.

158
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,840
What do you mean by that?

159
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,640
For goodness' sake.

160
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,850
I can't use my psychic abilities
if I don't get paid properly.

161
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,150
Sir.

162
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,320
The money I've already paid you

163
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,620
includes the entire condolence
money we got at my son's funeral.

164
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,520
Mister, please.

165
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,460
Then I'll only charge you half of it.
How about 5,000 dollars?

166
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,930
That's the lowest I can go.

167
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,870
Okay.

168
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,070
Thank you.

169
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,340
It's so dark now. Get home safely.
I'll go on in.

170
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,090
My gosh. Spiritual Father,
please get some rest.

171
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,860
-We can tidy up.
-No, it's all right.

172
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,130
Oh, you took
all the elderly home, right?

173
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,200
Gosh, Spiritual Father.
I've done this enough to know the drill.

174
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,080
Apostle Jo, please watch your mouth.

175
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,350
Goodness, why are you so prickly?
I like everything about you

176
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,680
except for how cold you are.

177
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,850
We're apostles chosen
by the Almighty.

178
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,720
You've turned over a new leaf
after your salvation.

179
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,630
You should change the way
you talk to befit the new you.

180
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,790
Yes, you're right.

181
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,900
I've been redeemed.

182
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,170
I went inside the elderly's homes
to prepare their beds

183
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,840
and emptied their chamber pots
for them, Spiritual Father.

184
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,010
Everyone becomes equal
when they join us.

185
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,780
Even though some are poor
and powerless,

186
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,620
please don't discriminate
against them.

187
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,160
Of course.
I won't, Spiritual Father.

188
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,890
Oh, Apostle Kang.

189
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,300
You've been looking
after Sang-mi's family, right?

190
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,260
Yes. But,

191
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,670
Ms. Kim isn't in her right mind
due to the shock.

192
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,100
It looks like she's been
seeing a number of doctors.

193
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,870
They must be having
a hard time treating her.

194
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,150
She'll come back
to the arms of Almighty soon.

195
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,220
Our Almighty

196
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,220
sometimes uses evil people
to save those who are just

197
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,390
and helps us attain true happiness
through misfortune.

198
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,990
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

199
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,860
I'll do it.

200
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,300
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

201
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,610
(MUJI-GUN POLLING STATION 1)

202
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,410
Candidate Han,
did you have a good dream last night?

203
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,580
I'll tell you all later.

204
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,589
You're running independently
without support of any parties.

205
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,359
Do you think you'll be
the first governor

206
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,089
to get elected
three times in a row?

207
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,270
I'm just a faithful servant
of the residents of Muji-gun.

208
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,470
I trust that everyone knows
which candidate would be

209
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,400
the hardest-working servant.

210
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,180
Do you think that your father
will get elected?

211
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,950
I'm not sure.

212
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,220
That's the correct answer.

213
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,860
No one can predict who'll get
elected until the result is out.

214
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,830
See you later.

215
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,870
Sir.

216
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,540
You can't get a better deal elsewhere.

217
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,610
It's an old model,
and the mileage is high too.

218
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,180
It was going to get scrapped soon anyway.
Aren't I right?

219
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,250
But,

220
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,620
it was like a child to me.

221
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,220
Sorry?

222
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,630
Oh, I see. Bye, then.

223
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,700
Wait. Just a second, please.

224
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,590
(Gosh, look at that!
It's holding out.)

225
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,730
My gosh, is it on something today?
It's very aggressive.

226
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,260
It might win.

227
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,400
Gutsy is staying strong though,
don't you think?

228
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,340
Dong-cheol must be doing okay, right?

229
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,010
I know that he'll stay strong like
Gutsy and get through it all.

230
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,110
My gosh.

231
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,780
(-Oh, my!
-It's attacking!)

232
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,790
-Go, Gutsy!
-I knew it.

233
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,320
-Gutsy!
-You guys were wrong.

234
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,830
(Gutsy won!)

235
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,060
(Dong-cheol.)

236
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,230
Go in.

237
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,080
(Your eyes remind me of my son.)

238
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,750
Sang-jin,

239
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,260
I'm sorry.

240
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,060
I was too indifferent towards you.

241
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,730
You were going through a hard time,

242
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,870
but I didn't know any of that.

243
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,240
Have you been doing well?

244
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,680
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

245
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,980
-Hey.
-What?

246
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,050
Wasn't it here?

247
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,390
Yes, this is where he broke his back.

248
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,190
But why did Dong-cheol do that to him?

249
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,490
Didn't you know?

250
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,430
They got into a fight because of
that girl from Seoul.

251
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,560
Why?

252
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,160
-I heard she's that kind of girl.
-What?

253
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,200
-What do you mean?
-I heard she sleeps around.

254
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,330
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

255
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
I heard she moved here
because she got expelled from

256
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,140
her previous school for sleeping
with older men.

257
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,480
Eat up.

258
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,120
Gosh, the weather is so nice.
Don't you think so?

259
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,880
Yes.

260
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,220
My goodness. Just a second.

261
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,790
I need to spray this.

262
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,560
What's that?

263
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,890
It's Living Water.

264
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,260
It comes
from the Spring water of Salvation

265
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,370
that was touched
by our Spiritual Father.

266
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,070
It can work miracles
by even curing the sick.

267
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,570
It also makes the food taste better.

268
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,370
I see.

269
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,410
-You can eat it now.
-Okay.

270
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,650
Also, take this.

271
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,220
You can give this to Sang-mi
and your wife.

272
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm sure they haven't been able to
eat properly either.

273
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,890
But,

274
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,000
why are you being so nice to us?

275
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,670
We have nothing to give back to you.

276
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,240
Because he exists.

277
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,470
-Pardon?
-We didn't meet you

278
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,710
by coincidence.

279
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,980
Everything that happens to us
is a message from Almighty.

280
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,620
Our Almighty told us to

281
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,050
take care of our troubled brethren
as if they were our own family.

282
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,430
I'm sure Almighty is trying to
tell you something too.

283
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,430
It's just that we're not able to
see what that is yet.

284
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,130
So try to pay close attention.

285

Do not be surprised,

for I will be your Almighty.

301
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,440
I will make you strong.

Yes.

306
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,700
It was all a message from Almighty.

307

It's okay. Don't worry too much.

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,880
Seok Dong-cheol's phone number?

313
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,790
You won't be able to reach him
for a while.

314

What do you mean?

315

Well, the thing is...

-How should I put this?
-Dong-cheol

317
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,970
went to a youth detention center.

318
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,140
What?

319
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,310
Why did he go there?

320
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,950
Because of me.

321
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,520
This all happened

322
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,850
because of me.

Hey, are you Seok Dong-cheol?

324
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,280
Why do you want to know?

325

You're new here, so there should
be a welcoming ceremony.

00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,100
at the national youth athletic
competition.

329
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,840
So it's going to hurt a bit.

330
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,070
Let me tell you something.

331
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,840
Someone gave me some pocket money,

332
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,310
and asked me to make you into
a disabled person.

333
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,400
Who asked you to do that?

334
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,200
I'm home.

335
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,440
Why did you come home so late?

336
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,540
My homeroom teacher wanted
to talk to me.

337
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,910
Honey.

338
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,550
Sang-mi's here. Let's go now.

339
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,150
Okay.

340
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,420
Where are we going?

341
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,120
There's someplace
we need to go together.

342
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,360
We're going to meet Sang-jin.

343
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,530
Apparently, we'll be able to
meet him there.

344
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,030
Dad, if we're going to

345
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,230
that place we went last time,
I don't want to go.

346
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,600
You know that Mom's condition
became worse after that day.

347
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,710
We're not going there today.

348
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,080
Then where are we going?

349
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,340
We're going to Guseonwon.

350
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,910
Guseonwon?

351
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,950
Sang-mi.

352
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,550
I finally get it now.

353
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,820
The reason why we came to this
neighborhood.

354
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,690
The reason why Sang-jin
had to die like that.

355
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,760
The reason why your mom's
suffering like this.

356
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,760
It was all a message that
our Almighty was trying to send to us.

357
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,370
Dad, what are you talking about?

358
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,070
We became the chosen ones
by our Almighty.

359
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,370
Stop saying weird stuff!

360
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,610
Let's not do this.

361
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,810
Let's just take Mom to a big
hospital in Seoul.

362
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,480
Sang-mi.

363
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,520
Guseonwon is the only place
that can heal your mother.

364
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,330
Let's go there and
let the Spiritual Father pray for us.

365
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,130
You're lying.

366
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,300
What?

367
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,740
Stop lying.

368
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,870
What do you mean?

369
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,350
You're doing this
because of that woman.

370
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,810
Sang-mi.

371
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,450
I saw you with her earlier.

372
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,350
I'm scared.

373
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,820
Those people give me the creeps.

374
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,690
Sang-mi, don't say that.

375
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,930
They're special messengers
who are here to save us.

376
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,670
Dad.

377
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,640
Why on earth
are you being like this?

378
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,420
Sang-mi, I'm really

379
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,360
doing this for you and your mom.

380
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,060
So please trust me.

381
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,090
Just once more.

382
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,370
Trust me just once more. Please?

383
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,000
Please?

384
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,140
Dad.

385
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,520
Let's go see Sang-jin.

386
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:07,320
(MEET ALMIGHTY AT GUSEONWON)

387
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

388
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,330
-It's okay. Don't worry.
-Be careful.

389
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,000
Watch the steps.

390
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,270
Here's a can of soda.

391
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,910
Jeong-gu likes soda.

392
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,250
My gosh, what's gotten into you, Jeong-gu?

393
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,680
You're giving it to her?

394
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,020
Here at Guseonwon, we call him Angel.

395
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,250
He loves soda so much

396
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,920
that he never offers it to anyone
except for his grandmother.

397
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,990
Gosh, Jeong-gu. You sure are a boy.

398
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,360
You like pretty girls too, don't you?

399
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,900
Sang-jin. Sang-jin...

400
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
What?

401
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,500
Sang-jin.

402
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,440
-Right, Sang-jin.
-Oh, right.

403
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,810
Spiritual Father is waiting for you.
Let's go.

404
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,510
-Okay.
-Sang-jin.

405
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:19,460
(Hide carefully,
I can see strands of your hair)

406
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,830
(Hide carefully,
I can see strands of your hair)

407
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,680
(Hide carefully,
I can see strands of your hair)

408
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,720
Found you.

409
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,030
(2017, 3 YEARS LATER)

410
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,320
Excuse me.

411
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,260
You have such a pure soul.

412
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,460
Your face tells us that you were
born with so much good fortune.

413
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,200
Your ancestors must've done
a lot of good deeds.

414
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,300
Please allow us to share a few words
of wisdom over a cup of tea.

415
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,570
Wait, sir. It won't take long.

416
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,310
A motorcycle, which was driving
along a shoulder

417
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,210
between a three-lane road
and sidewalk,

418
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,480
bumped into a taxi that was pulled
over as its door opened suddenly.

419
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,250
After the accident, the driver
sued the private taxi association,

420
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,520
and court ruled that the
association is responsible

421
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,120
for 70 percent
of the total damages,

422
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,160
and the driver of the motorcycle
for 30 percent.

423
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,430
The verdict was certainly in favor
of the driver of the motorcycle.

424
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,430
Do any of you think
that the verdict is problematic?

425
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,140
Yes, you in the red blouse.

426
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,970
In cities, you see motorcycles
not staying within lanes,

427
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,940
and they often drive
in between cars.

428
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,850
Many drivers have experienced
dangerous situations.

429
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,650
Hence, I think that the verdict

430
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,820
might actually encourage motorcycle
drivers to drive on shoulders.

431
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,190
That's where I think problems
can arise.

432
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,160
Right, I see.

433
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,620
Does anyone have a different opinion?

434
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,230
Yes, you over there.

435
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,100
As for this case,

436
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,740
court deemed the taxi driver
more responsible for the accident,

437
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,900
but I don't think the verdict was wrong.

438
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,980
In my opinion, the bigger
problem is that

439
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,740
the customer who opened the door
wasn't considered a defendant.

440
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,880
The driver of the motorcycle
just sued the association.

441
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,480
Had the customer of the taxi
been one of the defendants,

442
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,750
both the customer
and the association

443
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,290
would've been held responsible
for the damages.

444
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,220
If that was the case, the association

445
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,060
might decide to sue
the customer as well later on.

446
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,210
Hey, Sang-hwan. You have to come
to the end-of-semester party, okay?

447
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,870
Hey, wait.

448
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:59,210
The seniors said everyone
has to be there.

449
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,220
You'll come, right?

450
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,650
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Nice to meet you all.

451
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,420
Hey, you.

452
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,260
Why aren't you drinking?

453
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,430
I'm a lightweight.

454
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,030
What?

455
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,040
I can't drink much.

456
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,390
Drink up.

457
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,660
(Eat.)

458
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,200
Hey, I said eat your lunch!

459
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,970
Drink up, you jerk!

460
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,200
(Please help me.)

461
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,380
Please help my brother.

462
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,720
You said you'll take care of it
on your own.

463
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,830
Okay, I will.

464
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,170
Hey, don't drink that.

465
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,410
Who would want to drink your saliva?
It's disgusting.

466
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,650
And according to Article 324
of the Criminal Code,

467
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,880
you're committing coercion now.

468
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,950
What?

469
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,880
Those who exercise violence
or use threats

470
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,120
to obstruct someone's rights
or force someone to do something

471
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,220
can be sentenced to
up to five years in prison

472
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,990
or amerced up to 30 million won.

473
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,530
Gosh, who is this lunatic?

474
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,670
Hey, where's the representative
for the first year students?

475
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,240
Yes, I'm here.

476
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,170
-Are you the representative?
-Yes.

477
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,070
This is all because you haven't
been behaving yourself.

478
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,940
That's why those under you
can act up like that.

479
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,110
Do you want to be charged
with assault too?

480
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,750
Let go.

481
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,320
Hey, what do you think
you're doing now?

482
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,190
Are you out of your mind?
Let go of his hand!

483
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,560
Are you all right?

484
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Hey!

485
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,500
If this idiot isn't going to drink it,

486
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,210
you'll have to drink it yourself
before you go. Got it?

487
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,210
My goodness.

488
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,350
Sang-hwan, how did you suppress
yourself in all these years?

489
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,220
What? Is this idiot from the countryside?

490
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,060
All right, then. This is self-defense.

491
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,900
-My gosh!
-Gosh!

492
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,300
You little...

493
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,330
Quit making lame attempts,
and just come at me all at once.

494
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,310
What do you plan on doing
once you get out?

495
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,410
I'll have to work hard

496
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,540
and make a living.

497
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,780
Now that you've gotten neat haircut,

498
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,050
you should start over and
become a new man.

499
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,590
Move it slowly. Move it slowly.

500
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,400
Move aside a bit.

501
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,710
That's perfect. Move it down slowly.

502
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,940
That's right. That's perfect.

503
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,610
Be careful.

504
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,150
Move slowly. Slowly, please.

505
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,620
Move it down slowly. That's perfect.

506
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,230
Welcome, Senator Park.

507
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,470
I haven't come in such a long time.
Forgive me.

508
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,510
Don't be sorry.

509
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,640
You've become the highest member
of your party. I'm sure you're busy.

510
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,310
Your father is in good hands.
There's no need to worry.

511
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,820
Dad.

512
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,990
I've come to see you.

513
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,250
Aren't you my son's friend?

514
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,030
I'm your son, Yeong-cheol.

515
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:22,470
In order to see you more often,

516
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,640
I should make more visits.

517
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,510
Would you like to have a meal
with me some time?

518
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,110
How is your health, Senator?

519
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,480
Ever since I've started drinking
the Living Water you gave me,

520
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,750
I've been able to sleep well at night.

521
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,260
That proves how much Almighty
loves you, Senator.

522
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,590
It's Almighty's blessing, isn't it?

523
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,600
Senator, thanks to you,

524
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,500
Muji has developed greatly.

525
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,330
It's all thanks to you, Spiritual Father.

526
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,620
(MUJI DISTRICT OFFICE, WITHDRAW
PERMISSION TO CONSTRUCT SANITARIUM)

527
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,890
(DISTRICT OFFICE SHOULD APOLOGIZE
FOR CAJOLING MUJI RESIDENTS)

528
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,860
Hey.

529
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,400
You're the governor's son, aren't you?

530
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,670
You must've mistaken me for
someone else.

531
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,670
Come see me some time.

532
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,710
I'll give you a good time. All right?

533
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,890
Isn't that Sang-hwan?
I haven't seen him in a long time.

534
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,260
Gosh. He sure is good-looking.

535
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,510
We're up here. Sang-hwan.
Sang-hwan.

536
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,650
You're here.

537
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,250
Gosh.

538
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,050
-We got you. We got you.
-Gosh.

539
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,650
You guys wait right there.

540
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,020
Hey! I got you! Die!

541
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,490
Hey. Why did you shoot water at me?

542
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,090
Welcome, Sang-hwan.

543
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,900
How have you guys been?

544
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,100
Do you still do that show?

545
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,300
Of course. You won't believe
how many viewers I have.

546
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,140
Shut your mouth.

547
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,640
How long has it been since you
were here?

548
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,170
Hasn't it been almost three years?

549
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,540
It's been about three years.

550
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,710
Anyway, how did you guys know I was here?

551
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,550
Of course the source of all
information in Muji,

552
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,680
Pil-su, told us. He said he saw you
at the terminal.

553
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,290
This town is way too small.

554
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,390
Gosh. When you come here,

555
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,330
you should bring along some
girls from Seoul.

556
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,730
You should know better.

557
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,470
Gosh.

558
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,100
Are you ignoring me?

559
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,670
That's exactly what I'm doing.

560
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,340
Don't move. Attention, at ease,
attention, at ease. Face down.

561
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,440
Face down. Put your head
on the floor.

562
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,880
-I won't let you ignore me.
-Cut it out.

563
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,680
Gosh. You guys haven't changed a bit.

564
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,250
Do as I say.

565
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,880
-Give that back.
-Don't move.

566
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,100
They shouldn't be making noises.

567
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,000
They'll get in trouble.

568
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,770
This is soda. I like it.

569
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,110
What was that?

570
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,850
Are we playing hide-and-seek?

571
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:31,450
(Hide carefully,
I can see strands of your hair)

572
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,240
Where are you?

573
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,240
There you are. I found you.

574
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,360
(Please stop. Stop it.)

575
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,390
(Please stop. Help me.)

576
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:18,260
(SONG JI-EUN)

577
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,340
They're fighting.

578
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,880
You shouldn't fight. It's not right.

579
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,090
It's you.

580
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,220
It's you again. Mr. Jo.

581
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,490
Jeong-gu likes soda.

582
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:53,230
Mister, give me soda.

583
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,400
Jeong-gu likes soda.

584
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,960
Sang-mi.

585
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:56,760
You showed us everything last time.
Don't act shy.

586
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,130
This fool peed in his pants.

587
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,570
Sang-mi.

588
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,870
Jeong-gu.

589
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,410
What do you think you're doing?

590
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,450
It's not what you think.

591
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,820
Jeong-gu was caught stealing money.

592
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,490
That's nonsense.

593
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,960
You know perfectly well he's not
the type that would do such a thing.

594
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,460
How would you know?
You never know.

595
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,630
He might be putting up an act right now.

596
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:30,760
If you beat him one more time,

597
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,470
I'm really going to report you
to the police.

598
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,340
Sang-mi.

599
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,070
What are you saying right now?

600
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,840
Someone might mistakenly think
that I beat him often.

601
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,010
Don't think I'm stupid.

602
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,520
There seems to be a big
misunderstanding here.

603
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,890
I didn't beat him.

604
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,090
I just punished him to prevent
this from happening again.

605
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,600
Jeong-gu is the person I care for
the most in Guseonwon.

606
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,770
Why would I ever hit him
without having a good reason?

607
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,640
Don't you agree, Jeong-gu?

608
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:17,380
Jeong-gu, you must be trying
to make her feel sorry for you

609
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,480
because she's holding you
in her arms.

610
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,650
Let's go.

611
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,620
Let's go and have you get changed.

612
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,690
Be careful.

613
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,630
Sang-mi.

614
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,100
Everything that happens in Guseonwon

615
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,440
needs to be kept and dealt with
in Guseonwon. You know that, right?

616
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,080
Bye, Jeong-gu.

617
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,360
Jeong-gu's sick.

618
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,200
We need to take him to the
hospital right now.

619
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,470
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

620
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,240
My goodness, Sang-mi.

621
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,940
Don't you know
that we are in a silent period?

622
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,680
You did that to him.

623
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,150
Sang-mi, stop being so rude.

624
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,520
How many times must I tell you to
call him Apostle Jo?

625
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,690
He's right, Sang-mi.
Instead of going to the hospital,

626
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,020
he can just drink Living Water
to get better.

627
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,730
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

628
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,830
Dad.

629
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,030
Sang-mi.

630
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,800
The Spiritual Father's
Living Water can cure anyone.

631
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,270
He's just suffering from a bad cold,
so just a drop of Living Water

632
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,370
will make him get better in no time.
Okay?

633
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,580
He's right, Sang-mi.

634
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,980
Let's cure him with our faith.

635
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,980
Do you guys seriously believe in that?

636
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,120
Do you really think

637
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,290
that water can work miracles?

638
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,290
Sang-mi, how dare you say such
evil things?

639
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:48,560
I want you to repent on
what you just said.

640
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,660
Dad!

641
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,230
Please wake up and
come to your senses.

642
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,770
That water won't help Jeong-gu.
He needs to go to the hospital.

643
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,070
Until when are you going to
live your life like this?

644
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,310
Three years have passed.

645
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,640
Every year, I always wished that
we'd get out of here.

646
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,040
But it's been three years already.

647
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,680
Look at Mom.

648
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,020
How can you call this a place of
salvation and miracles?

649
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,330
Sang... Sang-mi.

650
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,670
I was just--

651
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:28,800
You're crazy.

652
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,810
Staying here like this

653
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,010
is just crazy.

654
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,780
You guys are all crazy too.

655
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,720
Salvation?

656
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,090
Eternal life?

657
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,690
Do you really think you can
get that from living here?

658
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,430
Please get back to your senses.

659
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,160
Sang-mi.

660
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,430
I can't take this anymore.

661
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,770
Apostle Jo, please take her to
the prayer room.

662
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,470
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

663
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,540
Let's go pray, Sang-mi.

664
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,080
-Let me go.
-Let's go pray.

665
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,280
I said, let me go!

666
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,710
Call him out.

667
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,460
If someone's sick,

668
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,330
that person should go to the hospital.

669
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,560
Without faith,

670
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,270
this liquid right here is just
a bottle of plain water,

671
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,500
just like what Sang-mi said.

672
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,870
If you pretend to believe only
because you're scared about...

673
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,440
what the others might think of you,

674
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,350
that would be the biggest sin
you could ever commit.

675
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,760
I'm sure you think

676
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,430
everything here is fake.

677
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,840
But you'll soon realize that

678
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,210
everything here is real.

679
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,080
The outside world

680
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,780
is what's fake.

681
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,050
What are you saying to him?

682
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,260
Sang-mi, you're so sensitive.

683
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,190
I think of Jeong-gu
as my own family.

684
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,830
Is it a bad thing to ask
if he's doing okay?

685
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,570
I think Jeong-gu can go home now.

686
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,740
Excuse me.

687
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,840
What do you mean he can go home?

688
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,180
I'm not sick.

689
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,590
I miss my grandmother.

690
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:07,920
Okay, let's go.

691
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,470
We're almost out of gas.

692
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:30,080
Let's put in some gas
at that gas station.

693
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,250
Sang-mi, I'm going to go take a leak.

694
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,720
My gosh.

695
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,870
Jeong-gu, are you cold?

696
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,740
I'm scared.

697
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:02,870
Are you scared?

698
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,880
I'm scared of him.

699
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,250
He hit me.

700
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,020
You shouldn't swear.

701
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,590
That lady kept saying that it hurt.

702
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,290
But he kept hitting her.

703
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:23,330
She kept telling him to stop.

704
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,640
Jeong-gu, what do you mean?

705
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,240
Did he also hit

706
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,980
other people?

707
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,750
You're a bad person
if you hit someone.

708
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,420
So he's a bad person.

709
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,350
"I'm going to kill you if you
say anything."

710
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,690
"I'm going to kill you
and your grandmother."

711
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:28,960
Get off me.

712
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,660
Here's that soda you like so much,
Jeong-gu.

713
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:06,930
I'm giving it to you since you were
such a good boy.

714
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,100
Aren't you happy?

715
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,940
It's soda.

716
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,410
I like soda.

717
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,280
That phone doesn't even work.

718
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,990
Why are you holding on to it so tightly?

719
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,590
Tell me.

720
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,780
Gosh. Drive smoothly, will you?

721
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:56,110
We have a patient in the car.
Don't pass speed bumps so quickly.

722
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,520
Speed bumps mean you should
slow down, don't they?

723
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,100
(SAVE ME)

724
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,530
Almighty, please help me.

725
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:22,970
Indeed.

726
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,370
Our Spiritual Father will save you.
He is eternal.

727
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,970
Those who believe in him will
live after death.

728
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,640
You will go on living forever.

729
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,710
Drink plenty of water.
