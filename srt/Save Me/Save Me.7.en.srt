1
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,900
(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,130
I trust that you will grant us
our wishes and redeem us.

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,600
Almighty, you saved us

4
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,770
and have guided us through pain.

5
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,220
Hi. Yes, Apostle Jo.

6
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,360
Yes.

7
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,870
Yes, I will see you then.

8
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,090
Hey.

9
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,190
I don't think we can do this today.
Let's go.

10
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,590
Let's go.

11
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,900
-What is it?
-My cell phone.

12
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,670
-I must've dropped it.
-Goodness.

13
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,280
You two should stay here.
I'll go and get it.

14
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,610
Be careful.

15
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,510
My gosh.

16
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,890
(Miss.)

17
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,160
Are you really his girlfriend?

18
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,930
Yes, I am.

19
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,100
Did your boyfriend
really use violence against you?

20
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,970
-He says you asked for his help.
-Dong-cheol.

21
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,270
When were you released?

22
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,510
A few days ago.

23
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,610
You should get your act together
if you've been through all that.

24
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,080
-You got into trouble already.
-He said I was seducing a guy,

25
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,820
-I'm sorry.
-and he grabbed my hair.

26
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,120
If you don't want to be sued
for damaging properties,

27
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,390
you'll have to pay settlement money.

28
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,860
-Get off me.
-Your hair didn't fall out.

29
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,630
-See? It didn't fall out.
-Let go.

30
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,430
-Okay.
-You were looking at that guy...

31
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,000
Sang-hwan, I'm scared. Let's go.

32
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,170
Wait.

33
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,070
Since we're already here,
let's check it one more time.

34
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,910
Gosh, are you out of your mind?

35
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,410
We almost got caught.
How are we going to do that?

36
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,650
We should be bold and ring the doorbell.

37
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,850
What?

38
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,550
Who will do that?

39
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,760
Dong-cheol.

40
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,930
Yes?

41
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,930
Well...

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,830
Have you met Jeong-hun?

43
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,730
No.

44
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,440
Please don't get me wrong when I say this.

45
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,240
Okay.

46
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,210
I don't want you

47
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,180
to see Jeong-hun.

48
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,920
He has to go to college this year

49
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,650
and well... Anyway,

50
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,520
you know what I mean, right?

51
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,260
Yes.

52
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,960
I'm not going to see him again.

53
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,300
Don't worry.

54
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,900
I'll be going then.

55
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
-Sergeant Woo.
-What? What is it?

56
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,440
We got a report that there is a fight.

57
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,710
Goodness.
Why are there so many incidents today?

58
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm sorry, Dad. Forgive me.

59
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,780
Gosh. Do you live here?

60
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,850
Yes, I just moved here.

61
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,760
Oh, I thought you were staying
in Guseonwon.

62
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,930
Well... It's because of my daughter.

63
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,730
I guess it can be dangerous

64
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,970
if she stays with ordinary people.

65
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,670
You made the right choice.

66
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,710
By the way, what brings you here
at this hour?

67
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,510
Well... A crazy punk pulled a prank.

68
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,710
What is your daughter doing?

69
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,620
Why are you asking about my daughter?

70
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,550
It's just that

71
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,820
we got a report that it sounds like
you're using violence on her.

72
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,860
Violence?

73
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,860
She's my precious daughter.

74
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,330
My daughter says strange things

75
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,900
and yells sometimes.

76
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,670
It's not a condition
that easily gets better.

77
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,310
Is she taking medicine?

78
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,880
Yes, she just fell asleep
after taking medicine.

79
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,510
Well... If it's okay,

80
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,910
could we go inside and check?

81
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,250
We don't have to do that. Let's go.

82
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,820
Gosh, you should be resting.

83
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,590
I'm sorry we bothered you.

84
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,650
It's okay.

85
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,320
Sir, we did get a report.
I think we should--

86
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,560
I said we don't have to. Let's go already.

87
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,990
Hey, can you hear them?

88
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,860
No, I can't hear them at all.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,030
I'll try recording it.

90
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,030
-Good night then.
-Okay.

91
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,840
-Take care.
-All right.

92
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,670
Come on, let's go.

93
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,640
Sir, we have a protocol for this.

94
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,550
Hey, you don't know how a parent feels.

95
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,910
-Are you recording it?
-Don't push me.

96
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,120
What was that?

97
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,220
I think they're the ones
who made the prank call.

98
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,620
-Hurry up, we should follow them.
-Okay.

99
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,230
What on earth are you doing?

100
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,340
Dad.

101
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,110
I don't want to hate you.

102
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,909
No, I don't want to despise you.

103
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,919
So please listen to me.

104
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,350
-Give that to me.
-No.

105
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,390
We have to get out of here, Dad.
We must save Mom.

106
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,760
I mean it! We have to get out of here!

107
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,190
Give it to me!

108
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,140
You're the one

109
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,870
who is insane.

110
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,970
You are

111
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,940
the sickest person.

112
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,920
Sang-mi, Spiritual Father said

113
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,690
Almighty never gives us agony

114
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,560
that we can't handle.

115
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,090
Almighty is testing us

116
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,460
if we deserve to be on
the Boat of Salvation.

117
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,930
How did you come to this?

118
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,540
How...

119
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,210
How did you come to be a monster?

120
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,880
We have to go to the sunrise service,
so go to sleep now.

121
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,180
We did a crazy thing in a long time.

122
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,980
We won't get a chance to do it again.

123
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,150
We won't be able to do it when we get old.

124
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,820
I've never thought I'd be chased
by my dad's police car.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,130
By the way,

126
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,670
why did she go into that kind of a place?

127
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,000
Can't you tell? Her dad must have
dragged her in with him.

128
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,440
That's what I'm saying.

129
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,940
Why would he drag his daughter
into that place?

130
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,480
That's why it's a cult.

131
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,080
They work on anybody
including their own family.

132
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,450
Whatever. I don't know.

133
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,950
We'll be doomed if we get involved
and get caught.

134
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,690
Let's stop doing crazy things now.

135
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,820
Frankly, it doesn't matter
what happens to her.

136
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,520
It matters to me.

137
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,900
-Lie back down.
-All right.

138
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,570
Jeong-hun, let me see your cell phone.

139
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,910
-Why?
-It was recording when I found it.

140
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,950
See? Are you glad now
that I broadcasted it?

141
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,020
Here.

142
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,820
Before I play it,
I don't really like your attitude.

143
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,750
You should thank me politely.

144
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,290
Gosh, I see a mosquito.

145
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,790
-All right.
-Play it.

146
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,160
(Hi. Yes, Apostle Jo.)

147
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,800
-What?
(-Yes, it's me.)

148
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,300
-Gosh.
(-I called you because...)

149
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,930
-Turn up the volume.
-Okay.

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,600
(I think I should have
a surveillance camera in the house.)

151
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,670
(I feel that this place is
full with evil spirits.)

152
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,080
(Yes.)

153
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,310
(All right. I will see you
at the sunrise service.)

154
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,220
Hey. Gosh, I have
a bad feeling about this.

155
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,120
My dad told me not
to mess with a religion.

156
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,620
Sang-hwan, let's pull out of this now.

157
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,090
People in our country have
freedom of religion.

158
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,260
What do you want to do?

159
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,170
What would Dong-cheol do?

160
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
Sang-hwan.

161
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,250
Are you going to go home today?

162
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,920
No.

163
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,490
You fought with your dad, didn't you?

164
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,090
Sang-hwan isn't like you.

165
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,060
Get off. Get off already.

166
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,360
You're too heavy. Get off.

167
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,900
I'm off, guys. See you tomorrow.

168
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,100
All right. Bye.

169
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,780
Dong-cheol.

170
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,060
-Gosh! Hey, stop.
-Let go, jerk.

171
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,000
-Dong-cheol, don't.
-Dong-cheol!

172
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,400
Hey, Dong-cheol!

173
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,500
-Let go.
-Are you all right?

174
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,200
Dong-cheol, we're friends.

175
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,640
Let go of me.

176
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,140
I said, let go!

177
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,770
Dong-cheol, do you want
your leave to be canceled?

178
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,310
Hey.

179
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,080
You're the chief mourner.
You need to be here for your grandmother.

180
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,250
Don't do this.

181
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,390
Please don't.

182
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,990
Hey, that's enough.

183
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,330
Dong-cheol is more hurt than I am.

184
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,830
Just let him

185
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,670
do whatever he wants.

186
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,770
I know

187
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,440
that you don't want to see me.

188
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,910
But

189
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,850
can you put up with it just this once?

190
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,480
Look.

191
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,720
Do you know how my grandma died?

192
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,120
She wanted to send me money.

193
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,130
She went out at the break of dawn
to collect boxes to sell,

194
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,430
and she died in a hit-and-run accident.

195
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,970
-It's all your fault.
-Dong-cheol, stop--

196
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,110
Just because you wanted

197
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,750
to make sure your stuck-up father
gets elected as a governor,

198
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,990
you ruined my life

199
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,349
and killed my grandma.

200
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,960
You killed both of us!

201
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,829
-Hey, stop!
-Let go!

202
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,430
Hey!

203
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,500
Stop it already!

204
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,470
What on earth are we doing now?

205
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,640
How did we end up in this mess?

206
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,170
Hey, Jeong-hun!

207
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,980
Dad, I didn't know you would be here.

208
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,790
You little...
I told you not to stay out this late!

209
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,290
Dad, did Mom nag you or something?

210
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,400
Why are you out here alone?

211
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,030
Don't you know that your mother
can't dare to nag me?

212
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,600
I know that, of course.

213
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,570
What would my dad like the best?
Let's see.

214
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,740
Chili pepper paste and mayonnaise.

215
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,510
Your eyes are screaming
chili pepper paste. Aren't I right?

216
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,180
I'll dip this in here, then.

217
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,450
Here.

218
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,410
Why are you doing this?
You're creeping me out.

219
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,950
I'm creeping you out? Gosh, Dad.
I'm your one and only son.

220
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,220
Have this.

221
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,320
There's too much chili pepper paste.

222
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,430
-Jeong-hun.
-Yes.

223
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,330
Drink with me.

224
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,480
You know that I went through hoops
to have you, right?

225
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,640
Mom gave birth to me though.

226
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,310
It was me. It was all me, okay?

227
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,620
Right, you did all the work.

228
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,250
I started from you, then met Mom
and came out into this world,

229
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
so strictly speaking, it was all you.

230
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,030
Gosh, Jeong-hun. My son.

231
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,560
You're my everything.

232
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,400
-You know that, right?
-Yes.

233
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,970
Gosh, Dad. It hurts.

234
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,030
Let go of my hand.

235
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,800
Don't you dare touch me ever again.

236
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,710
Mark my words.

237
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,450
Even if you end up

238
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,920
regretting everything and beg me
and Mom for forgiveness,

239
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,660
I absolutely can't forgive you.

240
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,230
No, I will not forgive you.

241
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,630
(GUSEONWON)

242
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,540
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

243
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,780
-Everything's been good, right?
-Yes, of course.

244
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,820
Almighty keeps us safe, you know.

245
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,050
Did you have a good sleep?

246
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,590
Your mom's been waiting for you
since dawn.

247
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,290
She's not the only one
who's waiting for you.

248
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,930
Spiritual Father is dying to see you too.

249
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,910
Get in.

250
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,820
They're waiting for us.

251
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,420
Sang-mi, you're in good spirits today.

252
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,730
Right.

253
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,360
(GUSEONWON)

254
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,680
Please get off, Sang-mi.

255
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,020
Why are you tying up
your shoelaces so tightly

256
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,490
as if you're going to run away again?

257
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,100
Please go ahead.
I will go and see my mom first.

258
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,100
Let's go together after the service.

259
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,640
Don't worry.

260
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,510
I'm not going anywhere.

261
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,080
Sang-mi. You shouldn't be rude
to Apostle Kang.

262
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,850
All right then. We still have time
before the service.

263
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,350
Go and see your mother.

264
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,580
Spiritual Father. You wanted to see me.

265
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,550
I heard there was a little disturbance
on the street.

266
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,190
Oh, yes.

267
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,820
Sang-mi's friends from high school
came to us

268
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,060
and asked us about Sang-mi.

269
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,360
It wasn't a big deal. Please don't worry.

270
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,300
Sang-mi's father said
it isn't the first time

271
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,640
they came to see Sang-mi. Is that true?

272
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,210
Yes. Actually,

273
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,380
we had a minor collision in an alley.

274
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,220
I believe those young men saw Sang-mi
in the car then.

275
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,760
What did they say to Sang-mi?

276
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,090
They asked her if she needs any help

277
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,970
and said they'd help her
if she's in danger.

278
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,170
Those who need to be saved
act as though they are the saviors.

279
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,310
I think it's just their
youthful indiscretion--

280
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,510
Apostle Kang.

281
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,110
Yes.

282
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,780
I think it's time for you to repay

283
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,820
the blessing you've received
from Almighty.

284
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,320
Starting tomorrow,

285
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,090
please get ready

286
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,560
to take Spiritual Mother with Sang-mi.

287
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,760
Spiritual Mother?

288
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,600
I should have an innocent spiritual wife,

289
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,200
and get everyone on the Boat of Salvation

290
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,810
with the blood of atonement.

291
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,950
I believe it.
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

292
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,720
"With the precious blood,"

293
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,360
"you shall attain salvation."

294
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,560
"With the precious blood,"

295
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,900
"you shall attain salvation."

296
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,630
Mom.

297
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,600
No one will save us here.

298
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,910
"With the precious blood,"

299
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,980
"you shall attain salvation."

300
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,250
"With the precious blood,"

301
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,580
"you shall--"

302
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,450
Mom. These are all lies.

303
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,890
It will only encage us and ruin us.

304
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,460
-So please.
-No!

305
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,290
Mom. Please don't fall apart anymore.

306
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,260
No! No, Sang-mi!

307
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,270
No.

308
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,000
Do you know how valuable this is?

309
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,710
Sang-jin and we can't live
in the paradise without this.

310
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,250
Isn't it true, Sang-jin?

311
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,320
This place is the paradise, isn't it?

312
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,850
Do you see that, Sang-mi?

313
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,220
Sang-jin's disability disappeared

314
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,560
after he came here.

315
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,200
But now,

316
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,570
I'm the one in pain.

317
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,010
Sang-jin. Come here.

318
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,810
Come here. Lie down beside me.

319
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,590
Come here.

320
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,840
My dear Sang-jin is like a baby now.

321
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,850
Sang-mi.

322
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,720
You should come here too.
Lie down beside me.

323
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,850
Mom.

324
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,020
What about Sang-jin?

325
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,190
I will put both of you to sleep today.

326
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,730
Come here.

327
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,610
Mom.

328
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,210
I will keep knocking

329
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,820
until someone hears me.

330
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,720
I won't stop knocking,

331
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,200
and

332
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,770
I will escape from this place
no matter what.

333
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,540
I will get out of here with you, Mom.

334
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,750
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

335
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,390
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

336
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,550
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

337
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,120
Are you on your way to harvest the fruits?

338
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,590
Yes, Spiritual Father.

339
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,260
Ms. Park, you're working very hard
these days, and it looks beautiful.

340
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Gosh.

341
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,130
Apostle Kang.

342
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,670
It's okay for me to be loved
by Spiritual Father too, right?

343
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,970
Yes, of course.

344
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,940
I will spare his love for you.

345
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,680
You don't admire me,

346
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,520
but admire Almighty, right?

347
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,780
-Yes. Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Yes.

348
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,720
All right. Please get ready to go now.

349
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,020
-Okay.
-Okay.

350
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,190
Sang-mi.

351
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,600
Do you know

352
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,470
what the Nine Fruits of Almighty are?

353
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:11,350
Love, patience, diligence, joy,

354
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,680
peace, goodness, gentleness,
fidelity, and moderation.

355
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,920
"You can only free yourself from
the agony and pain of the evil"

356
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,220
"when you lead a life
that bears all these nine fruits."

357
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,320
Is this what you want to say?

358
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,430
You remember it very well, Sang-mi.

359
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,470
However, you shouldn't show
your faith with your head.

360
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,130
You should show it with your actions.

361
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,270
Faith is not

362
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,240
something you can impose on others either.

363
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,610
All right, guys.
I'm eating Chinese food today.

364
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,550
I will finish this jjamppong
and jjajangmyeon in 60 seconds.

365
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,350
Someone said, "You liar."

366
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,920
You're the liar.

367
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,760
Okay then. If I can't finish it in time,

368
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,660
I will give everyone 100 dollars.

369
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,660
I will give all of you
100 dollars each. Okay?

370
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,900
I will set the timer to 60 seconds now.
Here we go.

371
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,430
I'll start eating now.
Watch it carefully. All right.

372
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,830
Start!

373
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,180
I'm done with this.

374
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,680
I've finished jjamppong.

375
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,920
It takes less tim to eat jjajangmyeon.

376
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,570
Don't mess with food.

377
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,670
Hey!

378
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,170
Why do you mess with a person then?

379
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,310
What are you...

380
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,810
My goodness.

381
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,180
This is... I failed because of you!

382
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,950
Are you going to pay them 100 dollars?

383
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,380
I'm sorry, this doesn't count.

384
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,650
My friend stopped me.
We've been friends for 10 years.

385
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,050
-I don't know what he's thinking.
-Hello.

386
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,060
Were you doing that silly thing again?

387
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,190
Did you memorize them all?

388
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,030
-Yes.
-Let's see. "How are you?"

389
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,560
"I'm fine, thank you. And you?"

390
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,630
Okay.

391
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,930
You idiots.

392
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,870
You have to go to college this year.
Do you understand me?

393
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,170
Dad, don't you believe in your son?

394
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,670
"Believe".

395
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,780
It means to trust.

396
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,610
Wait, Dad.

397
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,480
Well, I need to buy a book.

398
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,620
I heard that's what the students
in Seoul use to study.

399
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,880
-Right?
-Yes.

400
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,920
How much do you need?

401
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,660
-Around 30,000--
-20,000 won will do.

402
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,990
You little...

403
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,460
If I catch you getting into trouble
like Dong-cheol...

404
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,870
Dad, did you meet Dong-cheol?

405
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,930
Mr. Woo, do you know where he is?

406
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,040
Well, he's...

407
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,310
What's going on?

408
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,180
Hey, you're here.

409
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,950
What is it?

410
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,260
What is it, Man-hui?

411
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,190
What are we going to do about Dong-cheol?

412
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,360
What about him?

413
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,230
Well, I heard that he works

414
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,870
at a nightclub.

415
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,420
Hey, I won.
That means you have to buy pizza.

416
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,120
What are you talking about?
Your last shoot was worth two points.

417
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,390
What? That was worth three points.
What's wrong with your eyes?

418
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,560
I have perfect eyesight.

419
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,430
Is that right? What are you going to do
with such great eyesight?

420
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,930
I'm going to become
a police officer.

421
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,200
A police officer?

422
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,940
I'm going to become a police officer
and find my mom.

423
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,510
Then I'm going to make
my grandma stop working.

424
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,050
What a devoted son and grandson.
Go ahead and do all the good stuff.

425
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,860
Hey, stand tall.

426
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,630
You're the one who should
stand tall, you fool.

427
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,660
I'm already standing tall,
so it's your turn.

428
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,800
Okay, let's both stand tall.

429
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,170
Whatever. My gosh, I'm so tired.

430
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,060
Dong-cheol! Dong-cheol, are you in there?

431
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,860
It's me, Sang-hwan!

432
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,470
Our club starts at 9pm.

433
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,470
Is Dong-cheol here?

434
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,010
He's trying to get back up and
live his life again. Don't sway him.

435
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,510
-What?
-Hey.

436
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,080
Do you know what kind of place prison is?

437
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,080
The thing you miss the most there
isn't jjajangmyeon or chicken.

438
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,719
You end up missing people the most.

439
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,290
It doesn't matter if it's someone
you used to hate or love.

440
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,630
That place makes you miss people.

441
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,960
-What do you know?
-Hey.

442
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,929
We're not living in Seoul.

443
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,070
Our town isn't that big for you
to have never seen Dong-cheol.

444
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,469
It's not that you couldn't find him.

445
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,480
You just avoided to. Do you understand?

our Almighty showed me

471

a very clear scene.
It was as if I was watching a movie.

472
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,220
Jeong-gu was

473
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,150
running around happily
beside our Almighty.

Yes, of course.

so that I can go to paradise

to meet Sang-jin in the future.

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,210
You devil!

488
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,440
You devil.

489
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,480
Ma'am.

490
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,150
My Jeong-gu went to paradise.

491
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,550
He's on the Boat of Salvation,
and he's happily

492
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,050
waiting for me to join him.
How could you say such a thing?

493
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,560
You good-for-nothing devil.
I hope you get hit by lightning!

494
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,100
She's right, Spiritual Father.

495
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,930
We've been going easy on her,
She's right, Spiritual Father.

496
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,830
We've been going easy on her,

497
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,970
but she really must have gotten
possessed by a devil.

498
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,370
Sang-mi, what's wrong with you?

499
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,270
How dare you act that way
towards Spiritual Father?

500
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,240
My loving sisters.

501
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,980
Don't consider Sang-mi's doubts as a sin.

502
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,650
I will not try to stop

503
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,820
Sang-mi from doubting.

504
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,890
Instead, let's pray.

505
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,290
Pray that your faith shall be as pure
and naive as Sang-mi.

506
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,390
Pray for this young lamb

507
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,300
so that she can learn how
to love our Almighty.

508
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,530
Bless her so that she can learn
how to fully accept

509
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,140
our Almighty.

510
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,240
-I bless you.
-I love you.

511
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,410
-I bless you.
-I love you.

512
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,380
-I love you.
-I bless you.

513
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,180
-I love you.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

514
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,450
-I love you.
-I bless you.

515
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,150
-I love you.
-I bless you.

516
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,420
Sir, you're getting a call from Weasel.

517
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,570
Why are you calling?

518
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,240
(Sir, what are you doing today?)

519
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,740
-Why?
(-We have a newbie,)

520
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,450
(and I was thinking of introducing
her to you.)

521
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,920
You little punk.

522
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,490
I'm working right now. Why would you
call me for that kind of thing?

523
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,320
(I'm sorry, sir.)

524
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,290
(We haven't had such a pretty girl work
for us in so long.)

525
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,230
(So I must have gotten too excited
about introducing her to you.)

526
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,660
(Forgive me, sir.)

527
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,700
We haven't met in a while,
so let's meet up for a meal.

528
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,000
(Salute!
I'll wait for your call, sir.)

529
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,740
This jerk is so loud.

530
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,180
My gosh, Lee Gang-su.

531
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,220
I'm still doing well.

532
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,860
Mom, do you remember?

533
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,670
You used to clip our nails for us
when we were young.

534
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,910
Sang-jin and I would always fall asleep
in the middle.

535
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,080
Now, it's my turn to clip
your nails for you.

536
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,300
Sang-mi, Spiritual Father
wants to see you.

537
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,700
You should stop and go see him.

538
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,240
I'll go after I'm done clipping her nails.

539
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,870
Sang-mi, you shouldn't make
Spiritual Father wait.

540
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,350
I'm almost done.

541
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,310
So please...

542
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,480
Please just let me finish this.

543
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,690
-Please help yourself.
-Okay.

544
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,740
Why did you call us here at this hour?

545
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,240
Everyone, please sit down.

546
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,650
Sang-mi.

547
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,320
Do you remember how you were
when you first came here?

548
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,630
In my eyes, you were a young lamb
with a very big scar

549
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,900
in your heart.

550
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,240
You felt guilty because
you blamed yourself

551
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,780
for your brother's illness.

552
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,580
What do you know?

553
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,050
Who do you think you are?

554
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,180
Sang-mi.

555
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,990
Our Almighty tells us
that we should never turn away from

556
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,390
our family, our brother,
and our neighbor's pain.

557
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,160
So as a shepherd,

558
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,130
how could I disregard you,

559
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,570
and stop myself from loving you?

560
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,570
Spiritual Father, I believe it.

561
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,970
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

562
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,110
Stop lying.

563
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,280
I don't believe you. You're

564
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,350
not a shepherd. You're just an evil devil.

565
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,450
Sang-mi.

566
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,450
How dare you say such a foul thing?

567
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,330
Therefore, I should save Sang-mi

568
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,300
before it gets too late.

569
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,300
Spiritual Father, does that mean

570
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,340
My goodness. Finally.

571
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,840
Sang-mi's going to become
the Spiritual Mother.

572
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,710
Congratulations.

573
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,510
Thank you.

574
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,220
They're right, Sang-mi.

575
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,750
Becoming the Spiritual Mother

576
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,350
is the biggest blessing you can
get in Guseonwon.

577
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,990
Thank you.

578
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,830
All of you are crazy.

579
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,160
Sang-mi.

580
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,700
Dad.

581
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,370
Do you really not understand
what this means?

582
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,600
Sang-mi.

583
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,640
Please use your faith to become obedient.

584
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,610
Sang-mi.

585
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,310
Don't come near me.

586
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,180
-Sang-mi.
-Sang-mi.

587
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,310
You're all grown up now.
You shouldn't act like a kid.

588
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,220
Don't do it.

589
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,860
Sang-mi, stop it. Put that down.

590
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,430
I'm telling you not to come near me.

591
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,900
Calm down, Sang-mi.

592
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,430
If you're going to make me
do as you planned,

593
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,340
I'm going to kill myself right now.

594
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,470
Sang-mi.

595
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,910
Yu-ra. Yu-ra.

596
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,480
Yu-ra. Yu-ra.

597
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,450
Yu-ra. Yu-ra.

598
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,860
Yu-ra!

599
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,590
No! Yu-ra!

600
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
No!

601
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,230
Don't do that, Sang-mi.

602
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,140
You shouldn't do that.

603
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,570
You won't be able to receive salvation
if you do that.

604
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,740
"Salvation"?

605
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,310
What do you even think that is?

606
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,220
In the end, you're just saying that
you're going to hand me over to him.

607
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,350
The plans of our Almighty

608
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,390
are sometimes hard for us humans
to fully understand.

609
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,360
But I know for sure that

610
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,360
through our devoted faith and belief,

611
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,100
our Almighty is only trying to save us
by giving us a never-ending life.

612
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,040
Put that down.

613
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,520
Sang-mi.

614
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,420
I'm not asking you to

615
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,500
come to me to fulfill my worldly desires.

616
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,800
I only want to show our Almighty

617
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,700
your faith and devotion towards him.

618
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,570
Do you still not realize

619
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,840
how much our Almighty and I

620
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,350
love you?

621
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,490
No!

622
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,720
Are you really

623
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,000
not scared of death?

624
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,440
You always talk about
salvation and eternal life.

625
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,240
You're probably the one
who's scared to die.

626
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,770
But I'm

627
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,570
not scared to die at all.

628
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,050
Honey.

629
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,060
Mom.

630
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,430
People seek for salvation and eternal life

631
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:23,440
because they are scared of death.

632
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,910
"If you believe in my words
and abide by them,"

633
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,280
"you shall be allowed
on the Boat of Salvation."

634
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,110
I believe it.

635
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:40,090
"However, if you do not believe
in my words"

636
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,160
"and refuse to abide by them,"

637
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,330
"I shall take away from you
that one thing"

638
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,410
"you cherish"

639
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,910
"the most."

640
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:14,550
My goodness.
Sang-mi's such a devoted daughter.

641
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,620
She cares so much about her mother.

642
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,690
Yes, of course.

643
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,030
Our daughter has

644
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,070
never once disappointed us.

645
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,270
Good job. I'm so proud of you.

646
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,270
Just take one step at a time.

647
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,110
Then I'm sure our Almighty
will enlighten you one day.

648
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,250
Good job.

649
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,550
What's wrong, Sang-mi?

650
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,820
Is there something wrong?

651
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,720
Mom.

652
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,490
Let's pray together.

653
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,290
If we pray to Spiritual Father,

654
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,060
our whole family will be able
to go to paradise.

655
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,000
Okay?

656
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,770
Mom.

657
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,570
Sang-jin, you should come in too.

658
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:10,180
Come inside and say hello
to Spiritual Father.

659
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,510
Hurry up. Come inside.

660
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,480
We all need to get on
the Boat of Salvation.

661
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,550
Come on inside. Hurry up.

662
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,590
Come on. Hurry.

663
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,830
You need to treat him well.
The guy who's coming is a real big shot.

664
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,100
He's a detective in Muji--

665
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,630
Salute! I'm glad to see you!

666
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,070
Why did you have to make me come
all the way here when I'm so busy?

667
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,970
You're seriously upsetting me.

668
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,610
I only called you over
because I missed you.

669
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,540
I don't have any other reasons.

670
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,580
Who are they?

671
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,550
What are you doing?
Hurry up and say hello.

672
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,750
He's a competent detective
from Seoul who came all the way here

673
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,180
to help with the development
of Muji Police Station's homicide team.

674
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,490
Let me introduce to you
Detective Lee Gang-su.

675
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,760
Ta-da!

676
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,330
What are you doing? You're pressuring me.

677
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,600
My gosh, these girls also came
from Seoul yesterday.

678
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,470
They're from Gangnam.
They used to work at luxurious bars.

679
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,440
Luxurious bars, my foot.

680
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,110
Did you guys get kicked out of
your old workplace because

681
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,180
you got caught trying to pocket
some money behind your boss' back?

682
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,810
My gosh, no way.

683
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,450
Don't lie to me.
I can tell right by looking at you.

684
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,980
Let me teach you a little something
about Muji.

685
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,890
It's a strange place.

686
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,220
From the outside, it seems like
a peaceful place, but if you

687
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,360
look carefully, there's something
fishy about the place.

688
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,730
Listening to you talk like that,
you seem like a movie director.

689
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,170
You're truly keen.

690
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,540
This may seem like the middle of nowhere,
but you'll find

691
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,910
the cream of the crop here.
You'll be able to make some good money.

692
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,080
Now go and sing a song.

693
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,480
You guys,

694
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,950
do you know what these are?

695
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,120
These represent our lives.

696
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,990
Our lives are all screwed up.

697
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,090
Look here. This is your life.

698
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,460
This is your life,

699
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,360
and this is my life.

700
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,800
This isn't what I had planned.

701
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,440
We promised we'd join the army together.

702
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,010
Don't be too sad.

703
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,440
I'm sure Dong-cheol knows how you feel.

704
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,650
You two read each other's thoughts
like twins.

705
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,180
How do you expect me to make
all the deliveries?

706
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,690
You'll have to hire one more person.

707
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,720
Hello? Hello? Gosh.

708
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,030
He hung up on me again.
I can't believe him.

709
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:43,060
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

710
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,400
-Why do you ask?
-What did you say? You punk.

711
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,340
I saw Dong-cheol at the stadium
just a while ago.

712
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,140
The stadium?

713
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,870
You fools. Don't act so childish.

714
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,040
If you guys had a fight,
just make up already.

715
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,450
If you don't make up now,
it'll last a long time.

716
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,750
Hello? Go ahead.

717
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,850
Gosh. I need a smoke.

718
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,790
Man-hui, I think I should go.

719
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,690
Sang-hwan, are you sure
you'll be all right?

720
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,400
I have

721
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,770
something I need to tell Dong-cheol.

722
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,110
All right. Let's go.

723
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,540
Go back to sleep.

724
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,340
-Can I?
-Yes.

725
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,480
All right then. I'm going back to sleep.

726
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,270
Hey! Seok Dong-cheol!

727
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,680
Stand tall!

728
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,550
You fool.

729
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,100
Sang-jin, what's wrong with you?

730
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:05,540
Why are you saying that?

731
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,240
Mom.

732
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:14,280
Try talking to your brother.
He keeps saying strange things.

733
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,350
What is he saying?

734
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,490
He keeps saying that it's wrong.

735
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,460
He says we shouldn't stay here.

736
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,730
Mom.

737
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,200
Really?

738
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:38,140
Did Sang-jin really say that?

739
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,270
Dong-cheol.

740
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,840
If you call my name one more time,
I'll kill you.

741
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,070
Seok Dong-cheol.

742
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,310
I told you not to call my name.

743
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,010
Dong-cheol.

744
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,020
Fine. Go ahead and hit me.

745
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,150
If it'll make you feel better,
go ahead and hit me.

746
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,070
Is that all you have got?

747
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,500
Is that really the best you can do?

748
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,340
If this is what you want,
let's do it.

749
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,380
I told you

750
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,320
not to show up in front of me ever again.

751
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:38,590
But why

752
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,060
on earth do you keep on showing up
like this?

753
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,160
Because you're my friend!

754
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:49,130
Seok Dong-cheol, you fool.

755
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,870
You're

756
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,110
my dear friend.

757
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,970
I won't run away any longer.

758
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,610
I'll make sure to

759
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,380
save you from this place myself.

760
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:43,190
I'm sure that's what Sang-jin
wants me to do.

761
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,730
It sure has been

762
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,300
a long time since I've looked up
at the sky.

763
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,570
We haven't fought like this
since we were in ninth grade, have we?

764
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,350
Don't ever come looking for me again.

765
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:07,550
Why not?

766
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,150
It's hard for me

767
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,250
to look at you.

768
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,730
I saw Sang-mi.

769
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,100
I think

770
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,840
she could be in big trouble.

771
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,990
I just happened to see her
by chance in three years.

772
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:54,890
She asked me

773
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,100
to save her.

774
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,340
This time,

775
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,470
I

776
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:10,010
won't run away.

777
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,760
(SAVE ME)

778
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,360
Mom,

779
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:38,740
there was a girl I liked.

780
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,970
It was love at first sight.

781
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,380
But when she

782
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,980
asked for my help,

783
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,090
do you know what I did?

784
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,860
I ran away.

785
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,130
I keep

786
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,670
worrying about her.
