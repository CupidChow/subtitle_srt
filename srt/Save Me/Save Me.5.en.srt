1
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,000
(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,470
(EPISODE 5)

3
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,459
Where are we going now?

4
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Well, why don't we go watch the stars?

5
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,470
Let's go for a drive, Sang-mi.

6
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,640
Gosh. Drive smoothly, will you?

7
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,080
We have a patient in the car.
Don't pass speed bumps so quickly.

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,380
Speed bumps mean you should
slow down, don't they?

9
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,300
Jeong-gu.

10
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,200
Hold on tightly.

11
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,509
Hold on tightly like this.

12
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,420
Pull over! Stop the car! Pull over.

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,400
Pull over.

14
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,329
Jeong-gu.

15
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,340
Jeong-gu.

16
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,710
Jeong-gu, come on. Jeong-gu...

17
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,780
Jeong-gu, Jeong-gu.

18
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,950
Let's get out of here.

19
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,090
(GUSEONWON)

20
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,280
Let's go.

21
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,120
We're going to play
hide and seek from now on.

22
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,590
You have to hide where those people
absolutely can't find you.

23
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,160
Okay?

24
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,930
What is it?

25
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,830
Don't get all riled up.

26
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,790
I told you that you should never
rebel against me and Dad.

27
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
You are not an orphan, are you?

28
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Wan-deok.

29
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,360
All you need to do is do as I say.

30
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,230
Got it?

31
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,510
(Hide carefully)

32
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,930
I can't keep going.

33
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,140
I miss Grandma.

34
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,110
I want to... Take me to Grandma.

35
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,000
Jeong-gu.

36
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
You still have the phone, right?

37
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,270
Yes.

38
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,240
If you come with me
to the police station,

39
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,080
I'll buy you soda.

40
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,580
Soda?

41
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,250
Yes.

42
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,950
Ten cans. I want ten cans of soda.

43
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,490
Okay.

44
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
I'll buy you 10 cans of soda.

45
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,770
Jeong-gu...

46
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,120
Sang-mi.

47
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,350
I heard you used
to be on a volleyball team.

48
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,890
You sure are strong.

49
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,890
Goodness, I was so close
to letting you get away.

50
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,030
You are

51
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,300
evil.

52
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,900
I'm Almighty's servant
whose soul has been redeemed.

53
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,010
How can you say such a horrible thing?

54
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,080
I won't stay quiet any longer.

55
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,680
All of you,

56
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,510
I won't let you get away with it!

57
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,080
Then what will you do?
Will you report us to the police?

58
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,120
Sang-mi.

59
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,260
I thought you were smart,
but you're talking like a kid now.

60
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,430
My gosh.

61
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,660
Your body has fully
blossomed though.

62
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,610
Sang-mi.

63
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,740
You little...

64
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,480
Sang-mi.

65
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,620
-Jeong-gu.
-Sang-mi.

66
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,630
-Sang-mi.
-Let go!

67
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,200
All right. Look at this.

68
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,800
Open, select, and delete.

69
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,430
Okay?

70
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,140
Jeong-gu, no! Run!

71
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,110
-Run.
-Sang-mi.

72
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,320
Now, let's send Jeong-gu
to the promised land.

73
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,020
Jeong-gu!

74
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,460
-I was playing hide and seek,
-Jeong-gu, don't come. No!

75
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,830
but I've been caught.

76
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,590
No! No!

77
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,500
I like soda.

78
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,370
No!

79
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,130
(Hide)

80
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,170
(Carefully)

81
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,510
(I can see strands of your hair)

82
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,940
(Hide)

83
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,180
(Carefully)

84
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,680
Found you.

85
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,390
Sang-mi, we should get going now.

86
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,490
We'll be late
for the sunrise service.

87
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,160
Come on. Let's go.

88
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,510
Jeong-gu.

89
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,240
Hide carefully

90
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,750
until I come back to find you.

91
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,280
You must not come out until then.

92
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,980
I'm sorry to make you come
all the way here this early--

93
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,750
Shall I call the police?

94
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,790
Or shall we do things our way?

95
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,760
Gosh, my neck is... Goodness.

96
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,230
Apostle Kang, you could've given me
a heads-up before smacking me.

97
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,630
Anyway, I am sorry.

98
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,240
I'll repent and share my testimony.

99
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,710
Any injuries?

100
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,320
I wasn't asking about you.

101
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,890
Did Sang-mi get hurt at all?

102
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,960
No, there isn't a scratch on her body.

103
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,330
You know that she is special, right?

104
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,160
Of course.

105
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,700
Get in, Sang-mi.

106
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,910
Come on.

107
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,780
(GUSEONWON)

108
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
Sang-mi.

109
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,150
You have your cell phone, right?

110
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,600
You need to desert
all worldly things now.

111
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Give it to me. Come on.

112
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,250
(POWER OFF)

113
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,360
(GUSEONWON)

114
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,570
Sang-mi.

115
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,330
Our body and soul should always be clean

116
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,140
when we meet our Spiritual Father.

117
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,470
Don't you agree, Sang-mi?

118
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,280
You two should go and get treated
by the nurses at the sanitarium.

119
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,980
Gosh, this is nothing.
There's no need to make a fuss.

120
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,450
It's not good for the other
believers to see.

121
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,920
You should get treated.

122
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,830
I'll take Sang-mi with me.

123
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,060
Okay.

124
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,670
I should listen to you if I don't
want to get slapped again.

125
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,970
I'll be off then.

126
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,510
Sang-mi, shall we go now?

127
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,750
(GUSEONWON)

128
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,260
I believe in you, Almighty.

129
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,930
Please take my pain away from me,
and please protect my family.

130
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,700
You know about us more than
anyone else, Almighty.

131
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,280
Sang-mi.

132
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,380
Dad.

133
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,990
Jeong-gu...

134
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,720
Why... Why did you do such a thing?

135
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,130
Do you really want to end up in the
fiery pit by listening to the devil?

136
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,160
Are you being controlled
by the devil right now?

137
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,730
Dad.

138
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,740
Please don't do this.

139
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,870
I can't take this anymore.

140
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,510
Starting from today,

141
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,780
I want you to fast with me and
pray to Almighty in repentance.

142
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,850
No matter what happens,
I'm not going to

143
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,820
give up on you.

144
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,060
He's right, Sang-mi.

145
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,790
We're never going to give up on you.

146
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,870
Hurry up and say,
"Our wishes will be fulfilled."

147
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,130
Don't be afraid.

148
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,410
Our Almighty will always love you.

149
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,120
Our

150
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,720
wishes will be fulfilled.

151
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,130
That's right.

152
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,500
Sang-mi.

153
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,339
I'm glad you're here.

154
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,510
My gosh, your body is cold.

155
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,210
Please help her warm her body.

156
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,210
Okay, Spiritual Father.

157
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,850
Spiritual Father.

158
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,630
My daughter got possessed
by the devil and committed a big sin.

159
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,600
Please punish her
in accordance to her sin.

160
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,200
What do you mean?

161
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,210
Today is

162
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,610
a very happy day for me.

163
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,710
-Please stand up.
-Pardon?

164
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,380
A lost lamb came back to us
safe and sound.

165
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,590
If she ended up getting abandoned
out there by herself,

166
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,660
she would've suffered so much.

167
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,530
Spiritual Father.

168
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,330
Don't be too harsh

169
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,770
on Sang-mi.

170
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,970
We are always capable of falling for
the devil's temptation.

171
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,740
Especially at a time like this where
the world is full of pleasure,

172
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,610
the Devil comes to us with
an innocent mask...

173
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,220
and tempts us very strongly.

174
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,390
That's why we always need to be aware

175
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,060
and pray.

176
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,230
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

177
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,890
I believe in you, Spiritual Father.

178
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,910
Sang-mi.

179
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,210
Just a moment.

180
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,560
It's the silent prayer period.

181
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,490
Please be quiet.

182
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,570
Don't forget that
your mother is also here with us.

183
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,750
What do you

184
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,690
plan to do now?

185
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,920
What? What do you mean?

186
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,860
I'm talking about the boy.

187
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,060
Oh, Jeong-gu.

188
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,240
My gosh, it was just an accident.

189
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,340
He was already

190
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,740
a little sick in the mind.

191
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,810
He got off the car on our way back
because he wanted to take a leak.

192
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,720
Then he suddenly started running
towards the railroad.

193
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,420
My gosh, that punk.

194
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,830
Our Almighty knows everything.

195
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,230
If you've sinned,

196
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,900
please pray to Almighty in repentance.

197
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,110
Okay. I'm already praying every day.

198
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,580
If you don't have any more to say to me,

199
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,180
I'll excuse myself and
go pray to our Almighty.

200
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,920
Let Sang-mi

201
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,730
leave Guseonwon.

202
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,030
What?

203
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,470
Let her stay outside for a while.

204
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,070
How can you let her out

205
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,380
when she's already obsessed
about getting out of here?

206
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,740
Don't you know her?

207
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,450
She's been here for three years,

208
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,780
but no one knows what's in her head.

209
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,120
Don't worry.

210
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,090
Our Almighty knows everything.

211
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,920
My gosh, enough with the Almighty.

212
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,930
If anything happens from this,

213
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,060
it'll all be your fault.

214
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,150
My dear Almighty,

215
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,460
although

216
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,100
we pray to you in repentance,

217
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,390
there are still moments when
the evil greed of human beings
we pray to you in repentance,

218
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,500
there are still moments when
the evil greed of human beings

219
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,200
takes over our souls.

220
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,500
For those poor souls,

221
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,640
please help them get rid of

222
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,240
the evil thoughts in their minds.

223
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,810
Please guide them

224
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,620
with your merciful power,

225
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,260
so that they can fully obey
to your words.

226
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,440
The house of Ms. Choe Jang-mi,

227
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,910
who passed away last month,
is empty.

228
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,240
Let her stay there.

229
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,750
Do you understand?

230
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,890
Yes,

231
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,690
Spiritual

232
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,760
Father.

233
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,720
"I am life and resurrection."

234
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,250
"If you believe in me,
you will live even after you die."

235
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,220
"If you believe in me while you are
alive, you will never face death."

236
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,090
"Therefore, follow my path.
I am life and resurrection."

237
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,000
"If you believe in me,
you will live even after you die."

238
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,400
"If you believe in me while you are
alive, you will never face death."

239
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,970
You're right.

240
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,340
Our Spiritual Father is
life and resurrection.

241
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,680
The ones who believe in him
will live even after they die.

242
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,710
They'll never have to face death.

243
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,580
That goes the same for Sang-jin.

244
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,750
Drink a lot of water.

245
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,570
This is nice.

246
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,280
Governor, drinking alcohol
with rice and soup has become a habit now.

247
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,480
Do like beef soup now,
Detective Lee?

248
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,320
I've fully adjusted myself to Muji now.

249
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,560
Have you really

250
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,230
fully adjusted yourself to Muji?

251
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,570
Pardon?

252
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,810
Mr. Cheon's people have been
acting strange recently.

253
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,820
Our governor's been doing his best
for Muji's development.

254
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,890
But there are some pests who
keep getting in his way.

255
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,330
This guy's Mr. Cheon's henchman.

256
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,000
His name is Lee Jin-seok.

257
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,770
He needs a leash on him,

258
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,200
so that he won't bite others.

259
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,310
Here.

260
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,920
It's not important for you to
adjust yourself to Muji.

261
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,190
It's important for you to
adjust yourself to me.

262
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,830
My loyalty

263
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,800
is all yours.

264
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,810
Everyone.

265
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,250
Have you ever been on an
amusement park ride?

266
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,350
-Yes.
-Yes.

267
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,680
Right. Sir, do you know
roller coasters?

268
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,790
Yes.

269
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,350
You know those rides that
go in all kinds of directions?

270
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,660
-Do you know those rides?
-Yes.

271
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,330
The car seriously turned like this.

272
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,030
It flipped upside down.

273
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,400
And my mind suddenly went blank.

274
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,770
That's when

275
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,380
a bright beam of light

276
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,480
suddenly shone over me.

277
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,620
And under that bright light,

278
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,890
my body started to float like this.

279
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,340
I had never felt that kind of warmth
and comfort in my life.

280
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,670
Then, from up above the sky,
I heard a voice saying this.

281
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,510
"Son."

282
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,510
"My loving son."

283
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,020
"I want you to tell the believers
in Guseonwon"

284
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,520
"about the miracle you have
witnessed today."

285
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,320
That's what

286
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,620
I heard.

287
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,660
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

288
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,090
-I believe you!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

289
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,330
-I believe you!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

290
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,260
Calm down.

291
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,130
Everyone, look at me.

292
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,700
See? I'm good as new.

293
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,510
Thanks to our Almighty's
magnificent

294
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,510
grace and guidance,

295
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,580
I was able to walk out of there
without getting severely injured.

296
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,820
Everyone,

297
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,760
do you believe in our Almighty,
the owner of your lives,

298
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,460
and our Spiritual Father?

299
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,760
-We believe in them!
-We believe in them!

300
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,230
Do you earnestly wish
for our Almighty and Spiritual Father

301
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,970
to protect every one of you?

302
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,900
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

303
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,140
-I believe in them.
-I believe in them.

304
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,500
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

305
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,570
-I believe in them.
-I believe in them.

306
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

307
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,480
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-I believe in them.

308
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,850
-I believe in them.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

309
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,880
I believe in you, my dear Almighty.

310
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,790
My dear Almighty, you are
the one who knows my pain

311
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,490
more than anyone.

312
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,730
Please... Please protect my family.

313
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,500
The devil

314
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,630
is trying to take my daughter again.

315
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,470
Please help Sang-mi to not be
swayed by the devil

316
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,840
at any moment in her life.

317
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,210
Because of my carelessness,

318
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,480
my son, Sang-jin, had to
go to your side before me.

319
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,290
I sincerely wish everyone in my
family will get to meet together

320
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
on the day of salvation.

321
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,800
My dear Almighty.

322
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,440
I will give you everything I have.

323
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,440
I will give you

324
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,410
my soul and my life.

325
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,250
So please protect my family.

326
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,920
Please protect my family.

327
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,890
Please protect us.

328
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,330
Please protect us.

329
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,040
Please protect us.

330
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,780
I saw our Almighty

331
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,850
standing beside Jeong-gu
in my early morning prayers.

332
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,250
Jeong-gu's face was very radiant.

333
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:06,330
I shall pray for you and Jeong-gu.

334
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,940
Mom.

335
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,010
I'm sorry

336
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,180
for not coming more often.

337
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,350
Whenever I came to Muji,

338
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,080
I kept getting reminded of
what happened.

339
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,690
So it was really hard for me.

340
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,840
When did you come?
You didn't tell me you were coming.

341
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,380
I came the day before yesterday.

342
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,450
You should've come home and slept
there.

343
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,950
Did something happen in school?

344
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,020
Is that why you're here?

345
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,990
Why are you asking me when
you've already heard everything?

346
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,470
What are you doing right now?

347
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,450
Sang-hwan, your mother's muscles
have become weaker.

348
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,820
So I need to massage her more often.

349
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,520
That wasn't my question.
Since when did you

350
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,690
take care of my mom like this?

351
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,120
I asked her to.

352
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,860
Why are you being so sensitive?

353
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,230
Dad, I don't want

354
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,170
just anyone touching my mom.

355
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,210
Okay, I'll do it myself. You can go.

356
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,620
Don't make your mom worry.

357
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,790
I don't know about others,

358
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,030
but you never break your promises.

359
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,130
What are you talking about?

360
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,900
The promise you made me before.
That was

361
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,070
the only way I could see Dong-cheol.

362
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,610
But now, I can never

363
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,980
see him again.

364
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,750
Excuse us, please.

365
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,950
Yes, sir.

366
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,160
Sang-hwan.

367
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,600
I know this might sound like
an excuse to you,

368
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,910
but I did my best too.

369
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,679
Whatever the reason was,

370
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,179
a boy became disabled
because of Dong-cheol.

371
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,679
That's why it's hard to get him out.

372
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,520
Since you're studying law,
you should know it too.

373
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,290
I don't believe it anymore.

374
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,929
Are you really going
to do this to me?

375
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,130
All right. I will meet with
the warden of the prison and--

376
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,159
Dad.

377
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,199
Dong-cheol is being released from
the prison today.

378
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:39,870
If you really did your best,
how can you not know that?

379
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,980
-Listen, Sang-hwan--
-Perhaps,

380
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,480
Mom didn't want you
to become the governor.

381
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,580
What are you talking about?

382
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,090
I thought Mom would get better
and Dong-cheol would come back

383
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,260
once you became the governor.

384
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,590
But

385
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,130
nothing has changed.

386
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,740
Sang-hwan.

387
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,750
Why isn't he coming out?

388
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,380
-Yeong-min. Gosh.
-My dear. Yeong-min.

389
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,750
It must've been hard for you.

390
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,650
Eat this. Let's go.

391
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,620
You brat, don't cause trouble again.

392
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,060
You did good.

393
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,190
Are you okay?

394
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,700
-How do you feel?
-It's good to see you.

395
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,330
My dear.

396
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,240
Are you happy to be out?

397
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,170
They act like they respect me,
but it's just empty words.

398
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,670
Those brats keep ordering food.

399
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,110
I told them not to order food
to this neighborhood so many times.

400
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,150
Gosh, I'm going to teach them
a lesson today.

401
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,480
People here don't know how
to respect their seniors.

402
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,150
What a corrupted neighborhood.

403
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,450
You brats!

404
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,790
I told you I'd kill you
if you order food from here again!

405
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,930
Come on. It tastes better
while we look at the scenery.

406
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,030
You idiot. If you leave
the empty plates here,

407
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,100
every dog in this town will come
and poop on them.

408
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,730
Why is that our fault?

409
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,970
Besides, I don't see any dogs.

410
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,580
When you're done, you should
cover the plates with something.

411
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,280
Are you that stupid?

412
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,480
Brother.
Your words are really violent today.

413
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,820
It's bruising my heart.

414
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,620
Hey, you don't deserve pickled radish.
I'll take it back.

415
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,650
I was just kidding.

416
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,490
We can't eat jjajangmyeon
without pickled radish. Brother.

417
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,930
If you do that,
you won't find a girlfriend.

418
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,000
He's gone. He's really gone
with the pickled radish.

419
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,200
How can I eat it without pickled radish?

420
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,810
Sang-hwan. Are you having
a ritual or something?

421
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,380
What are you thinking so hard?

422
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,610
Dong-cheol

423
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,980
liked jjajangmyeon

424
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,650
Right.

425
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,960
That's right.
Dong-cheol really loved jjajangmyeon.

426
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,790
We ate jjajangmyeon and
other Chinese food with him once.

427
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,200
Do you remember that day?

428
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,230
Yes, all right. Keep eating.

429
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,700
Just keep eating. You're not supposed
to talk while eating. Okay?

430
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,490
Sang-mi. Let's go now.

431
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,430
Go where?

432
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,460
Spiritual Father granted it
for your sake.

433
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,530
We're going to live in the town
for a while, not in Guseonwon.

434
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,140
What about Mom then?

435
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,410
Sang-mi.

436
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
It's better for your mother to stay
here and continue her treatment.

437
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,020
I can't leave her alone here.

438
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:26,030
Of course not.
You can't be the only one to go.

439
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,400
This is our paradise and home.

440
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,660
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

441
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,800
Sang-mi, you will only
be sleeping outside.

442
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,710
You will come here every day,
attend the worship with her,

443
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,280
and do everything as usual.
Please don't worry.

444
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,250
Gosh, you must be very happy, Sang-mi.

445
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,180
You're going outside in a long time.

446
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,750
Am I right?

447
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,150
Apostle Jo.

448
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,020
The outside world is filled
with evil souls. Why would she be happy?

449
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,490
Please use only gracious words.

450
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,690
No, I won't.

451
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,260
I can't leave Mom here alone.

452
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,430
Dad, let's take her too.

453
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
Let's take her with us, please.

454
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,540
Sang-mi. Mom will be

455
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,940
very well taken care of

456
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,740
by these two apostles,
so please don't worry.

457
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,350
You know how good they are.

458
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,880
They are the best apostles of Guseonwon.

459
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,260
Mom. Get yourself together.

460
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,320
We have to get out of here.
Let's get out together.

461
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,390
Let go of me.

462
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,160
Mom. If you stay here...

463
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,360
If you stay here...

464
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,170
No, I won't go!

465
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,840
I'm going to live in the paradise
with Sang-jin.

466
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,540
Mom, don't do this.

467
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,810
This place is a fiery pit.

468
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,310
This is a horrible fiery pit.

469
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,880
No! No, this is the paradise!

470
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,650
(Let's fight the evil,
my dear brothers and sisters)

471
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,060
(We will reach the paradise
and every day will be a victory)

472
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,100
(We will get on the ship of salvation
on the Judgement Day)

473
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,970
(We will survive it)

474
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:16,540
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
(-We will have eternal life)

475
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,470
(-We believe in eternal salvation)
-I believe in it!

476
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,880
(We will have eternal life)

477
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,210
(-We will ascend into glory
-We will ascend into glory)

478
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,820
I believe in you, Almighty.

479
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,390
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-We believe in you.

480
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,790
See? She seems so happy.

481
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,760
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

482
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,690
I believe in you, Almighty.

483
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,740
Excuse me.

484
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,140
Could you pull over for a second?

485
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,480
What's wrong?

486
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,920
I want to go to the restroom.

487
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,690
If it's not urgent, you should wait.

488
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,990
Pull over.

489
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,030
Apostle Kang.

490
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,430
I need to use the restroom too.

491
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,380
(GUSEONWON)

492
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,160
Welcome.

493
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,700
I'm sorry, but may we use your restroom?

494
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,840
You're not here to eat.

495
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,440
We're from Guseonwon.

496
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,280
Oh, you're right.

497
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,580
You're the mistress who sang
with a beautiful voice.

498
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,150
Oh, my. I'm not the mistress.

499
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,820
Yes, you are.

500
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,750
Where is the restroom?

501
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,620
It's right around the corner outside.

502
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,220
Okay. Thank you.

503
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,390
Sure.

504
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,090
Oh, please wait.

505
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,430
Someone left a wallet here the other day.

506
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,040
Sang-mi, why don't you go ahead?

507
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,120
This is the one.

508
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,910
No!

509
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,390
Sang-mi.

510
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,530
What salvation and miracles?

511
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,500
I won't go! I'm going to live
in the paradise with Sang-jin.

512
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,970
This is the paradise!

513
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,760
Sang-mi.

514
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,440
Sang-mi, are you in there?

515
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,410
Sang-mi.

516
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,480
Sang-mi?

517
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,610
(GUSEONWON)

518
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,210
Darn it.

519
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,980
Did Sang-mi come back?

520
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,210
Start the car.

521
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,020
Gosh, she startled me.

522
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,450
Oh, my goodness.

523
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,620
Excuse me. Are you okay?

524
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,630
Please... Please save me.

525
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,610
Hey.

526
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,840
Why are you avoiding me?

527
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,680
Do you feel guilty or something?

528
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,580
We didn't avoid you.

529
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,350
You seem to be doing great.

530
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,790
Stop it already.

531
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,860
To be honest, we're the victims here.

532
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,960
What?

533
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:49,500
That's right. We couldn't enter
college last year because of it.

534
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,460
You still moved to Seoul

535
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:52,830
and entered college.

536
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,440
Are you done?

537
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,810
Sang-hwan, stop.

538
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,310
Hyung Seop still lives in a hospital
because of Dong-cheol.

539
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,510
Hey.

540
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,820
Listen to me carefully.

541
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,550
It wasn't because of Dong-cheol.
It was my fault.

542
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,190
Do you hear me?

543
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,890
Do you hear me?

544
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,330
All right.

545
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,870
Excuse me.

546
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,810
Do you know
your parents' phone number?

547
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,920
Where is your house?

548
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,520
I don't have a house.

549
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,030
Gosh, what are you calling for?

550
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,560
Is that so?

551
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,270
What?

552
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:04,440
Oh, yes. Okay, I got it.

553
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,970
Who is it?

554
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:14,680
Look. Do you live in Guseonwon?

555
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,030
What is she doing?

556
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,530
Please! Please let me get off!

557
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,900
Miss, please calm down.

558
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,070
Goodness. What's wrong?

559
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,840
Please help me. I beg you.

560
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,340
Calm down first.

561
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,840
Oh, gosh.

562
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,090
(POLICE)

563
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,750
Gosh, it's hot.

564
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,860
It's okay now. Please get off.

565
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,510
Listen.

566
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,240
Did someone from Guseonwon...

567
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Sang-mi!

568
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,320
Sang-mi.

569
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,860
How could you disappear like that?

570
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,660
I looked for you everywhere.

571
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:37,300
Gosh. You must be her father.

572
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,870
Yes, I'm her father.

573
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,040
Sang-mi. Your father was
really worried about you.

574
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,670
Sergeant Woo.
I'm sorry I always get help from you.

575
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,280
Come on.

576
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,980
Don't say that.
You're making me feel bad.

577
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,080
We're not strangers.

578
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,780
You're right. We're no strangers.

579
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,560
What are you doing?
Let them take her.

580
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,660
Yes, sir.

581
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,930
Thank you so much. Thank you.

582
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,330
Let's go.

583
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,500
No!

584
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,300
Officer. Please help me.

585
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,440
What?

586
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,810
These people are murderers.

587
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:26,810
They...

588
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:31,650
They killed Jeong-gu on the railroad...

589
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,950
-Goodness.
-On the railroad...

590
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,920
You were right.

591
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,430
This is so sad.
She's such a young person.

592
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,930
Gosh, it was fortunate that we found her.

593
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,740
Please take better care of her,

594
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,670
so she won't escape
and cause trouble again.

595
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,010
The world is a scary place.

596
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,710
Sang-mi was there
when the accident happened.

597
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,610
I suppose she was in great shock.

598
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,920
Goodness. She's not mentally stable,

599
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,390
and she even witnessed
that horrible accident.

600
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,790
Actually,

601
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,120
you seem around the same age as my son.

602
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,700
Listen, Miss.

603
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,830
Don't wander about the streets.

604
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,500
Just stay at home.
Do you understand?

605
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,340
I'm not crazy.

606
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,340
Dad.

607
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,550
Please say something!

608
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,480
Say something!

609
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,290
Sang-mi. Sang-mi.

610
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:42,890
Please stop.

611
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,620
Please. I'm begging you.

612
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,560
Whenever you behave like this,

613
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,200
it makes me so sad.

614
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,030
With your mother being
in the condition she's in,

615
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,240
I can't bear to see you like this.

616
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,370
Please get a hold of yourself.

617
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,540
Dad.

618
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,010
The things you see right now

619
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,780
are all lies made up by the devils.

620
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,220
Why do you keep falling for
their temptations?

621
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,820
Remember? Spiritual Father's said
the devils are liars and murderers.

622
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,860
-Sang-mi.
-Sang-mi.

623
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,100
Let go of me. Let go of me!

624
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,030
Sang-mi.

625
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,600
It's all your fault.

626
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,370
It's all your fault
Mom and Dad are like this!

627
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:32,670
Almighty.

628
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,240
Please forgive me.

629
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,410
This is all because I haven't
prayed hard enough.

630
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,750
Dad.

631
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,650
Please don't do this.

632
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,260
If you keep doing this,
I think I'll really lose my mind.

633
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,770
Our savior Almighty,
who has defeated

634
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,170
the power of death by the blood
of the lamb, I believe in you.

635
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,810
Mister, please don't do this here.

636
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,350
You shouldn't interfere
in others' family affairs.

637
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:17,550
I believe in our savior Almighty.

638
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,350
Almighty.

639
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:25,090
Please help my helpless, poor
daughter. Please defeat

640
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,160
the devil that is in her body.

641
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,190
Dad, please.

642
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,000
I command you devil
in the name of Almighty!

643
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,830
You devil, you shall

644
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,770
leave the body of my loving daughter.

645
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,710
You shall leave. You shall leave.

646
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,540
You shall leave her body.

647
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:45,240
-You shall leave her body.
-You shall leave.

648
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,410
-You shall leave.
-You shall leave.

649
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,080
You shall leave.

650
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,950
Leave my daughter's body.

651
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,160
I have cried out desperately to
our Almighty.

652
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,100
Almighty has answered our prayers
and rescued her from the devils.

653
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,200
Please don't worry too much.

654
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,540
Almighty has surely heard your

655
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,540
desperate prayers.

656
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,380
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe our Almighty.

657
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,850
-I believe our Almighty.
-I believe our Almighty.

658
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,550
Please get her in the car.

659
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,390
Sang-mi. Sang-mi, let's go.

660
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,390
Devils sure are scary.

661
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,090
-Officer Choe, don't you agree?
-Yes, but...

662
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,260
I think we should have her examined
at the hospital.

663
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,530
Those who are sick must go
to the hospital,

664
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,140
but not those with an injured soul.
Almighty is a skilled doctor.

665
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:51,010
Thank you for saving Sang-mi, officer.

666
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,140
You're welcome.

667
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,180
-By the way,
-Yes?

668
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,450
how did you get your hand injured?

669
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,890
You see, I fell while playing
hide-and-seek with the kids.

670
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,060
Why haven't you gotten married yet
when you love kids so much?

671
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,560
Let's not get into that.

672
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,000
What do you think about Officer Choe?

673
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,240
-Stop it.
-You shouldn't ask me such a thing.

674
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,070
She should meet someone
much better than me.

675
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,010
I'm a bit busy.
I should get going now.

676
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,680
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

677
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,710
Thank you. Keep up the good work.

678
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,580
Officer, thank you once again.

679
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,160
Gosh. Those devils are really scary.

680
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,630
You saw that too, didn't you?

681
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,000
Goodness.

682
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,540
Sang-hwan.

683
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,270
What's gotten into you today?

684
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,340
Have you only been practicing
your fighting skills in Seoul?

685
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,340
He's right. What's the matter?

686
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,460
Today's

687
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,960
the day Dong-cheol gets released
from prison.

688
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,100
You knew?

689
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,700
That's why you came here, isn't it?

690
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,400
It's not too late. Shall we go?

691
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,410
He rejected my visits for
the past three years.

692
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,640
Do you think he'd meet me now?

693
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,850
Excuse me. Can we get some more corn?

694
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,620
You want a refill?

695
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,520
Order a snack, you bums.

696
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,960
The economy is in bad condition.

697
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:50,800
There are tons of unemployed youths.
We don't have money.

698
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,660
Did you just mention the condition?

699
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,730
Are you crazy?

700
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,040
Then why don't you guys at least
join the army?

701
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,770
You guys haven't changed a bit
since you were in high school.

702
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,250
She's right.

703
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,080
Years have passed,

704
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,520
but nothing has changed.

705
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,430
(ARABIAN CLUB)

706
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,440
Where are you beauties headed?

707
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,430
I'll wake you when we get there.

708
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,230
Lie down and get some more rest.

709
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,570
He's right. Think of me as your mother.

710
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,370
Lie back down.

711
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,510
Sang-mi, do you feel any better
after being prayed for?

712
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,410
It's you people

713
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,680
who are the devils

714
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,080
living in fiery pits.

715
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,480
Sang-mi.

716
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:21,690
You're just like them.

717
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,720
You're

718
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,190
a devil just like them.

719
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:34,830
I feel comfortable and happy
when I'm in Guseonwon.

720
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:40,070
Going to town makes me uncomfortable
and gives me headaches now.

721
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,680
I don't know how I lived there
in the past.

722
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,780
Dad.

723
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:51,050
That's all because of
the evil souls.

724
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,520
This country isn't the right place
to live. It's full of evil souls.

725
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,360
Protests are everywhere, and people
always speak ill of each other.

726
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,890
We've been specially chosen by Almighty.

727
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,590
We should be grateful.

728
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,960
Indeed. We should be grateful
to be prepared for these hardships.

729
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,600
I'm truly grateful.

730
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,140
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-I believe in Almighty.

731
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,670
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

732
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,380
No one

733
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,850
seems to hear me.

734
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:26,990
No one.

735
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:57,920
Goodness.

736
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,290
Oh, dear.

737
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,260
Young men, forgive us.

738
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,890
As you can see, it's so dark
out at night.

739
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,460
Are you injured?

740
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,200
We're mutually at fault.

741
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,230
If we have insurance cover this,
it'll only raise our insurance fee.

742
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,370
Hold on a second.

743
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,210
Listen.

744
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,040
Accept this and let's just
settle this nicely.

745
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,580
Mister.

746
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,680
You must not know the law well.

747
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,620
If you hit a motorcycle,

748
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,790
you take 70 percent of the blame,
and I take 30 percent.

749
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:38,560
This is a one-way street,
and you hit us coming from the wrong way.

750
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,160
So this is 100 percent your fault.
We're not mutually at fault.

751
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,170
You look like a college student.
You must've studied law.

752
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:50,270
I get your point.

753
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,170
You should've told me sooner.

754
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,270
Look here. Here you go.

755
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,950
Take this. I'm truly sorry.

756
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,250
Mister.

757
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,820
If you're really sorry,

758
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:10,020
you should get out of the car
and apologize properly!

759
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,030
That's right. You're right.

760
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:16,190
I'm so lazy.

761
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,800
-Are you guys all right?
-Gosh.

762
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,500
I'll have to take a close look
when I get home.

763
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,370
Goodness. My neck aches.

764
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,210
Young men these days

765
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,780
sure are vigorous.

766
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,110
Goodness.

767
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:37,920
I truly would like to apologize.

768
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,990
Will this be enough?

769
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,660
Excuse me. I believe we made
an awful mistake. I'm sorry.

770
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,830
I'd like to apologize once again.

771
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:00,540
You shouldn't speed up in alleys.

772
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,740
Gosh. I think my shoulder might have
been dislocated. Are you okay?

773
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,940
This is serious.

774
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,610
-I didn't want to mention this,
-What is it?

775
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,620
but my father's a police officer.

776
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,620
Should I call him?

777
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,690
Hold on.
There's no need for that.

778
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,620
Since it's our fault, of course
we should handle this with insurance.

779
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,830
Wait a minute though.

780
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:25,800
I think I smell alcohol
from you three.

781
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,000
Shall we go to the station
your father works at

782
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,700
and have your blood alcohol level
measured?

783
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,940
Would you like to do that?

784
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:36,910
Since it's partly our fault as well,

785
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,040
why don't we settle things here?

786
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,450
Let's do that. Both sides are
to blame for.

787
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,350
-Don't you agree?
-Yes.

788
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,760
Save me.

789
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,650
(SAVE ME)
