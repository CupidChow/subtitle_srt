LOVING CITY, MUJI)

(Don't be afraid!)

6
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,860
The Almighty
will always be with you.

7
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,030
-Spiritual Father!
-Spiritual Father!

8
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,730
Don't doubt your faith.

9
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,040
The Almighty will be your savior.

10
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,870
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

11
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,610
Those who love the Almighty

12
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,350
will be set free
from diseases and pain

13
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,120
through his absolute powers.

14
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,820
-Do you believe it?
-Yes, we believe it!

15
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,910
Are you guys okay?

16
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,560
Honey, what happened?

17
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,130
The tire blew out.

18
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:28,200
-What should we do?
(-We believe it!)

19
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,960
Everyone.

20
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,500
As all of you know, Mr. Park here

21
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,470
is in the last stage
of stomach cancer.

22
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,800
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

23
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,510
Even doctors at a big hospital
in Seoul turned him away

24
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,840
and sent him back home, saying
he has no chance of surviving.

25
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,280
Is it true?

26
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,450
Yes, it is.

27
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,530
To a petrified patient
who is faced with death,

28
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,660
they said he can't be treated

29
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,130
and that he wouldn't survive
the cancer, then turned him away.

30
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,900
Can you say they did
the right thing?

31
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,170
-No!
-Not at all!

32
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,520
Honey.

33
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,690
Get back in the car.

34
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,140
Get inside the car
and stay there with the kids.

35
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,810
-Honey.
-Go on.

36
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,200
(Everyone.)

37
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,570
Nevertheless, our Almighty

38
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,170
will never turn away a patient
who came to him for help,

39
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,110
saying he can't be treated

40
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,840
and that he has no chance
of surviving.

41
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,580
He will not send him to the
dark valley of death.

42
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,620
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

43
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

44
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,090
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

45
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,220
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

46
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,960
My gosh, your tire completely
blew out.

47
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,300
Sir, are you okay?

48
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,530
Yes.

49
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,810
Mom, is everything okay?

50
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,850
Yes, everything's fine.

51
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,020
They're just here to help us.

52
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,920
Just stay inside. You'll get wet.

53
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,890
Is there a car repair shop nearby?

54
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,160
Yes, there is. I was just about to
make a call.

55
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,200
My goodness, you guys.

56
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm sorry for making you go through
all this in this rain.

57
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,310
No, it's okay. Plus, most places
around here

58
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,240
close after 7 p.m.

59
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,710
And no one from another
neighborhood will come

60
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,140
all the way here in this rain.

61
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,950
Hello? Hi, sir.

62
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,210
Someone I know blew out his tires

63
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,080
right outside of our town.

64
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,350
Oh, okay. I got it.

65
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,990
Please try to get here
as soon as possible.

66
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,020
-Why?
-He's pooping right now.

67
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,490
Excuse me, sir,

68
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,460
he says he's going to take
about 30 minutes.

69
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,670
So please wait a little bit.

70
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,200
Yes, okay.

71
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,340
Thank you so much.

72
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,070
I don't know how I should repay you.

73
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,810
-Well, you can--
-Hey, hey.

74
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,510
You don't need to repay us.
He'll be here soon, so don't worry.

75
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,450
Let's go. Bye, then.

76
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,520
Okay, thank you.

77
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,150
-Sang-hwan.
-Yes?

78
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,790
Aren't you going to come?
We'll leave you here then.

79
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,960
No, I'm going.

80
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,360
Bye. Thank you.

81
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,110
-Sang-jin.
-Yes?

82
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,309
Are you okay?

83
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,080
Yes, I'm okay.

84
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,880
Don't worry.

85
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,820
Nothing will happen here.

86
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,789
I'm not worried about that.

87
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,490
Under

88
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,560
the name of our savior,
the Almighty,

89
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,700
I will call out the evil disease

90
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,940
that is making my loving son,
Park Du-yeong, suffer in pain.

91
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,810
With the burning fire of salvation,

92
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,550
this dirty and ugly piece of cancer
that comes from the evil spirit

93
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,850
-Spiritual Father!
-will be

94
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,090
cured by the Almighty and become
clean again like snow.

95
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,860
-Spiritual Father!
-Spiritual Father!

96
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,730
-Spiritual Father!
-Spiritual Father!

97
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,700
-Spiritual Father!
-Spiritual Father!

98
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,640
-Spiritual Father!
-My goodness.

99
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,820
Look, everyone!
This piece of cancer

100
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,160
belongs to the evil spirit.

101
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,690
My goodness gracious.

102
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,460
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

103
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,600
Everyone, let's attribute this glory
to our Almighty.

104
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,240
Our savior, the Almighty!

105
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,810
-Our savior, the Almighty!
-Our savior, the Almighty!

106
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,940
Our savior, the Almighty!

107
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,980
Hey, listen.

108
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,850
Wasn't that girl who came
from Seoul really pretty?

109
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,780
Her face was so white and clear.

110
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,550
Didn't you see her stare at me?

111
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,890
That's nonsense.
She was looking at me.

112
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,520
-Do you want to bet?
-Ten dollars?

113
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,560
Fine.

114
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,990
You punks.

115
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,960
She was shooting lasers at my face.

116
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,560
When I saw those lasers,

117
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,330
I gave her the look.

118
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,270
-Our eyes locked.
-You punk.

119
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,370
It was electrifying.

120
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,770
You're full of nonsense.

121
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,970
Do you think your dad will
make it this time?

122
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Of course, he'll make it.
No one else is qualified.

123
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,980
You're right.

124
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,580
Ma'am, can we get our drinks?

125
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,150
Ma'am, what are these?

126
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,950
Why are they so black?

127
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,560
Do you want to end up at the
police station again?

128
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,930
Back then, I was in a bad condition,
so I made a small mistake.

129
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,160
"Bad condition"?

130
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,030
Quit that nonsense.

131
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,130
You can go somewhere else
if you don't want this.

132
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,970
My gosh.

133
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,210
How did we end up like this?

134
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,910
Forget it.

135
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,580
Here.

136
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,790
Let's just think of this as stout.

137
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,660
-Let's drink.
-Okay, let's drink.

138
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,300
"Quit that nonsense".

139
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,220
You were surprised, weren't you?

140
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,290
Don't worry.

141
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,730
Only good things will happen
from now on.

142
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,680
My gosh.

143
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,480
Sir, it's all done now.

144
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,880
Okay, thank you.

145
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,280
Here you go.

146
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,620
By the way, are you from Seoul?

147
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,160
Yes.

148
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,860
My gosh, why did you move
on a day like this?

149
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,690
I know.

150
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,100
But they say it's good luck to move
on a rainy day.

151
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,770
-You're right.
-Right?

152
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,070
Bye, then.

153
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,710
Sir, excuse me. Wait.

154
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,180
Yes?

155
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,150
It's the norm to order jjajangmyeon
on your moving day.

156
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,620
If you collect 10 coupons, you get
1 free dish of sweet and sour pork.

157
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,150
Have a safe trip.

158
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,190
Come here and eat.

159
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,020
Let's eat.

160
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,160
Hello, everyone.
I'll sing a song for you guys today.

161
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,150
Spiritual Father.

162
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,890
Mr. Park wishes to thank you for
what you did today.

163
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,430
Sir.

164
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
Spiritual Father.

165
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
Thank you so much for
saving my life.

166
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,180
I was wondering how I should
repay you

167
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,480
for the kindness I received
from you today.

168
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,980
And while I was coming here,
I heard something from Ms. Kang.

169
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,190
I heard that you're going to build
a church.

170
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,250
I would

171
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,090
like to be of help.

172
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,360
Brethren.

173
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,700
Do you know the name of this tree?

174
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,810
We call this tree

175
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,040
"A tree of belief".

176
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,010
As you can see,

177
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,310
it just seems like
an empty, old tree,

178
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,790
but it has lived for more than 500 years

179
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,120
with those sturdy branches.

180
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,960
This is

181
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,530
all thanks to the Almighty's
kindness.

182
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,630
And it can also be known as a miracle.

183
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,070
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

184
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,540
Brethren.

185
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,880
I am just a servant of our Almighty.

186
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,680
So you do not need to thank me.

187
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,350
All you need to do is to pray to
the Almighty for showing you

188
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,920
a miracle today.

189
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,210
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

190
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,910
(You've arrived at your destination.)

191
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,380
(Ending voice navigation.)

192
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,450
-Dad.
-Yes?

193
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,950
Are we at the right place?

194
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,020
Well, it is the correct address.

195
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,720
Wait here for a minute, okay?

196
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,450
-Honey.
-Yes?

197
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,750
One second.

198
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,580
Everything is okay, right?

199
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,920
Well, Seong-ho isn't picking up.

200
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,460
Honey, what if it's...

201
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,290
Gosh, no. Seong-ho would never do
something like that.

202
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,390
I'll try calling him again.

203
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,740
(Muji 1-1, do you copy?)

204
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,350
Muji 1-1 here. What's going on?

205
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,180
(We got a call about a drunk man
in his 40s)

206
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,890
(causing a scene in front
of the bus terminal.)

207
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,620
(-Please report to the scene.)
-Got it. Roger that.

208
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,830
Sergeant, Sergeant Woo.

209
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,230
Sergeant! Get up already!

210
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,830
Gosh, I almost jumped
out of my skin.

211
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,970
-Why? What on earth is going on?
-We got a call about a drunk man.

212
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,810
There's a drunk man right here.

213
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,740
My stomach is hurting so much
right now.

214
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,280
Sergeant, please get up.

215
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,160
Gosh, that totally scared me.

216
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,790
What's that guy doing?

217
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,630
You piece of...
I'll smash everything.

218
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,700
One, two. Microphone check. Gosh.

219
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,510
Sir, you can't be on the car
like that. It's dangerous.

220
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,510
-Please get back down.
-Is he out of his mind?

221
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,740
Hey, get down immediately. Get down!

222
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,210
Down, right now!

223
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,380
He must be crazy.

224
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,880
-Hey.
-He's about to...

225
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,490
You guys can't do this to me!

226
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,920
Gosh, Sergeant!

227
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,360
-Please stop him!
-Gosh, seriously. This is crazy.

228
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,220
He must be
completely out of his mind.

229
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,790
Sir, why are you being like this?

230
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,560
-Sir, please stop!
-Hey, get down!

231
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,200
You little... I told you
to get down. You piece of...

232
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,470
-I said, get down.
-Let go.

233
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,940
-Get down right now.
-Let go, you jerk!

234
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,310
Are we going home already?

235
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,010
It's already after 11 p.m.

236
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,810
Are you Cinderella or what?
Why do you have to go home so early?

237
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,650
It's the weekend,
so we should have fun.

238
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,950
-Aren't I right, Dong-cheol?
-What do you want to do?

239
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,620
Let's see. Since it rained...

240
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,990
Jeong-hun, come here.

241
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,590
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

242
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,330
-Are you staying out of trouble?
-Of course.

243
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,330
You know what happens
if you ride a motorcycle drunk, right?

244
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
You said I'll die.

245
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,840
And you should call your mom
if you're going to be home late.

246
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,570
I was just about to call Mom.

247
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,880
Dad, what happened to your face?

248
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,880
You're such a talker.
All you do is talk.

249
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,350
And you guys are in high school now,
so you should really study.

250
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,120
-Got it?
-Yes.

251
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,220
Oh, Sang-hwan.

252
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,090
Yes?

253
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,420
Your dad is doing well, right?

254
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,430
-Yes.
-Good.

255
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,200
He's the only man
of that caliber in this town.

256
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,270
I know that he'll get elected
as a governor.

257
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,270
Right, thank you.

258
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,110
-Water.
-Hey, what are you doing?

259
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,340
-Please don't.
-Don't! You better not do it here!

260
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,150
-Let's go, Officer Choe.
-Yes, Sergeant.

261
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,490
Bye, Dad.

262
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,890
Goodbye.

263
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,590
That served him right.

264
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,430
(GUSEONWON)

265
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,740
Everyone, our Almighty will save us.

266
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,770
Do you all believe it?

267
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,640
-Yes, we believe it!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

268
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,340
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

269
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,110
(Moon, the bright moon)

270
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,420
(You were created by our Almighty)

271
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,950
(The moon that rises at night)

272
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,620
(Was created by our Almighty)

273
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,930
(The moon that rises at night)

274
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,130
(Was created by our Almighty)

275
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,400
My gosh, Ms. Kang.

276
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,440
It looks like you get younger
every time I see you.

277
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,880
Here, we have a spring
that makes you younger.

278
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,840
You mean the Living Water?

279
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,380
Yes. Our Almighty graciously
bestowed it upon us.

280
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,520
Officer Choe. You should drink it
too, don't you think?

281
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,890
Sergeant, please.

282
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,560
My gosh, Spiritual Father.
Has everything been well with you?

283
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,660
Yes, things are always good
thanks to our Almighty.

284
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,970
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

285
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,610
Gosh, I'm sorry to bother you
like this so often.

286
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,870
Please don't say that.

287
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,210
You helped the lost soul
return to the Almighty again.

288
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
We should thank you.

289
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,320
My gosh, not at all.

290
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,950
Ever since you came to Muji-gun,

291
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,790
the town has been clear
of the destitute and homeless.

292
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,890
We should thank you.

293
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,100
Ms. Kang, how much of
the antler extract do we have left?

294
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,500
We gave them out
to the elderly today,

295
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,870
but we still have
about 20 boxes left.

296
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,700
I'm sorry that I'm offering you
what's left over,

297
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,640
but you should take some
and drink them on your way back.

298
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,150
Gosh, it's okay. We're not allowed
to accept such gifts these days.

299
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,620
Sergeant Woo, this isn't a bribe.

300
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,120
You work so hard day and night
for the safety of this town.

301
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,750
It's not like we're
offering you money.

302
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,960
Please think of it as food
your neighbor is offering you.

303
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,760
Well, I guess that's...

304
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,870
Oh, Officer Choe. I heard
your mother got her back injured.

305
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,230
Pardon me?

306
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,800
Yes, a little.

307
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:00,140
Our Almighty said good things must
be shared among neighbors.

308
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,610
This isn't from us.

309
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Our Almighty is giving it to you,
so it's okay.

310
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,480
You don't have to accept it
if it makes you uncomfortable.

311
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,350
We're offering it to you
out of goodwill,

312
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,190
but it shouldn't make you feel
uncomfortable.

313
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,330
Right?

314
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,830
Gosh, many eyes are on me.
I don't want anyone to gossip about this.

315
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,300
Eating wrong things can cause
hiccups.

316
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,010
Right, that wouldn't be good.

317
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,580
Go! Move, move!

318
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,920
Gosh, this feels so nice.

319
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,220
-Hey, don't!
-Don't do that!

320
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,490
-What was that about?
-Why did you do that?

321
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,530
Stop it!

322
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,840
Mom, aren't you eating?

323
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,080
No, I'm okay.

324
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,910
My stomach is a bit upset.

325
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,520
Where's Dad?

326
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,520
Hey, Seong-ho.
You didn't actually do it, right?

327
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,960
-That money is our everything.
-Gosh, seriously.

328
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,260
I'll pay you back with interest.

329
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,470
Hey, Seong-ho. Are you at
a gambling den now? Are you?

330
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,400
Answer me. Answer me now!

331
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,510
Goodness. Yes, I am.

332
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,610
I conned you, idiot.

333
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,150
Hey, Seong-ho. Seong-ho! Seong-ho!

334
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,620
(The phone is turned off. You'll be
connected to voice mail.)

335
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,360
Dad.

336
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,390
Yes?

337
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,670
-Did you see her?
-Yes, I did.

338
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,680
It's her, right?

339
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,380
That pale-faced girl from Seoul.

340
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,650
It seemed like she was
moving earlier.

341
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,920
You saw their stuff on the truck, right?

342
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,720
But why do you think
she's at the dry sauna?

343
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,790
Did she get kidnapped?

344
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,400
Are you an idiot?

345
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,570
What kind of kidnapper brings
the hostage to a dry sauna?

346
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,670
Then what else could it be?

347
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,540
She's coming.

348
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,610
My gosh.

349
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,810
She couldn't have seen us, right?

350
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,710
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

351
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,720
Jeong-hun, a man should always
stick to "Rock".

352
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,150
Go on.

353
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,220
Are you crazy?

354
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,460
Hurry up!

355
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,090
You jerks.

356
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,000
She's not here.

357
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,420
Excuse me.

358
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,350
By any chance, are you looking
for anyone to work here?

359
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,250
I'm... Oh, okay.

360
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,190
Excuse me, are you looking for
a person to work here?

361
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,660
-I can--
-No, I'm doing fine.

362
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,930
-There aren't many jobs.
-Oh, I see.

363
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,200
Excuse me, are you looking for
a person to work here?

364
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,730
I can do anything.

365
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,540
-I'm Han Yong-min.
-It's Han Yong-min.

You can trust me.

367

-Yes, of course.
-Please do well.

368
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,110
-Please pick number two.
-It's Han Yong-min.

369
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,980
Please help me win.

370
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,180
-I can do well!
-I hope you make it.

371
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,950
-Thank you for your support.
-No problem.

372
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,750
Everyone, I'm Han Yong-min,
candidate number two!

373
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,050
-Hello.
-Hello.

374
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,460
-My goodness.
-Good to see you.

375
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,990
How did you manage to come
all the way here?

376
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,390
I hope you get elected
one more time,

377
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,700
and help us save Muji-gun.

378
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,430
Thank you for your support.

379
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,900
As you already know, Muji cows
are the best in our country.

380
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,840
If you support me this time,
I promise I'll actively

381
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,880
support you in promoting
this town to attract tourists.

382
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,940
He's right. You should pick
the person who will work for Muji-gun.

383
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,850
You should pick the person who knows
what our people are going through.

384
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,050
You can trust me!

385
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,020
Everyone, give him a big hand!

386
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,590
Hello, sir.

387
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,460
I will make Muji-gun into a town
where jobless people

388
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,890
can continue to live a happy life.

389
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,960

get elected

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,630
for the third time,

391
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,170
I will put my life on the line and
do everything I promise to do.

-Han Yong-min.
-Han Yong-min.

393
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,940
-Han Yong-min.
-Hey, you over there.

394
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,640
Did you say you're looking for work?

395
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,980
Yes.

396
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,110
Okay.

397
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,480
Follow me.

398

Your ill body will get treated

399
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,100

401
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,710
your sick body will become
pure again

402
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,180
like it's a whole new body.

403
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,650
Hello.

404
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,550
-Thank you.
-This is for you.

405
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,650
Have a cup of coffee.

406
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,490
Thank you.

407
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,430
Thanks.

You need to take revenge.

410
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,840
You guys will end up getting
in trouble.

411

-We're all in this together, right?

00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,980
-Of course.
-Of course.

414
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,780
Of course. Let's go.

415
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,570
Hey.

416
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,070
My gosh, whatever.

417
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,670
Let's hurry up.

418
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,410
Hurry up.

419
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,710
Hey! You crazy jerks!

420
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,210
I'll get you!

421

Hurry up and go.

Bye.

What is this?

424
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,930
Hey, I already saw your faces!

425
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,130
I saw you already.

426
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,930
Get off that and come over here.

My gosh, they're incredible.

428
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,780
We were only looking for
Southeast Asian workers.

429
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,440
So we can't pay that much.
Is that okay with you?

430
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,210
Yes, I'm fine with that.

431
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,280
And it'll be very tiring.

432
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,790
I'll work diligently with
whatever you need me to do.

433
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,390
Okay.

434
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,260
Thank you.

435

But,

436
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,530
I heard that you also provide food
and a place to stay.

437
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:39,170
Would it be okay if I stayed here
with a few more other people?

438
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,270
Who else is there?

439
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,920
It's not bad.

440
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,490
Really?

441
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,860
Yes. It's fine as long as
we can stay together.

442
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,930
Yes.

443
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,570

-Be careful.
-Okay.

446
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,410
Why aren't you eating?

447
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,610
You should eat so that
they can start eating.

448
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,320
I'm sorry,

449
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
you guys.

450
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,800
Instead, I'll work diligently

451
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,570
and get a better place to live.

452
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,670
So please endure it until then.

453

454
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,780
When will we ever get to
experience this?

455
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,480
The air is nice,
and the water is clean.

456

We're eating dinner with
the sound of cows.

457
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,090
I'm happy because it feels like
we came camping.

Right, Sang-jin?

Yes, I'm happy too.

Hurry up and eat.

461

This is so delicious.

462
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,100
How does it taste, Sang-jin?

463
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,540
It's delicious.

464
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,710
-It's spicy, isn't it?
-Yes.

465
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,110

-It's nice.

My goodness.

468
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,050
It must be spicy for you.

469
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,520
It seems like he doesn't like it.

470
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,650
Is there a problem?

471
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,120
-That's not true. Stop saying that.
-It's nice.

472
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,860
-My gosh.
-Keep eating.

473
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,820
It's not too bad.

474
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,630
They look very happy.

475
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,390

love our neighbors
like we love ourselves.

need to do this.

00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,860
-Get him!
-Hey!

487
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,460
-Keep going!
-Come on!

488
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,659
-Yes!
-Go get him!

489
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,570
-Yes!
-No!

490
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,670
(WELCOME TO MUJI BULLRING)

491
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,850
Sang-hwan, they lost today.

492
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,320
Dong-cheol, you didn't feed him
something special, did you?

493
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,660
He's not normally that smart.

494
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,460
Hey, cheer up.

495
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,830
You don't need to use your brain
to fight. You just need courage.

496
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,670
Is that right? All you need
is courage?

497
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,200
Is that why you always get
yourself in trouble?

498
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,540
I think you should start using
your head a bit.

499
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,610
-Watch what you say.
-That's enough. Cut it out.

500
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,340
Sang-hwan, since your bull lost,
you're paying for the karaoke room.

501
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,810
-No objections, right?
-Right?

502
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,520
All right. Let's go.

503
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,530
Stop. I need to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.

504
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,930
All right. Make it quick.

505
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,140
There you are.

506
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,340
Please forgive me.

507
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,110
I noticed you made a beautiful
drawing on my motorcycle.

508
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,210
-Come here, you jerk.
-Stop!

509
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,820
Who are you guys?

510
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,280
You must not know what "stop"
means.

511
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,790
S-T-O-P. Am I right?

512
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,920
You jerks. Have you lost your minds?

513
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,060
What do you mean?

514
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,530
Aren't we all high school students?

515
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,800
Get them!

516
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,450
Guys! Run! Hurry! Run, run!

517
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,830
Hurry, hurry!

518
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,230
Are you guys ready?

519
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,850
If you guys want to get me,
come and try looking for me!

520
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,320
Hurry! Come this way!

521
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,420
Hurry up! Here they come!

522
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,800
Guys, don't leave me behind.

523
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,370
-Dong-cheol
-What?

524
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
What should we do?

525
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,780
Should we be courageous or
should we run away?

526
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,810
Real men should be courageous.

527
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,920
All right. I guess you're right.
A man should have courage.

528
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,060
That's enough!

529
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,700
-That's enough. Let's go.
-Sir.

530
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,970
Help me out here. You're
embarrassing me.

531
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,670
Didn't you hear what I said?

532
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,210
Are you Han Sang-hwan?

533
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,640
I am. Why do you ask?

534
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,880
Sang-hwan.

535
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,720
That's impressive.
A guy should be tough like you.

536
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,790
I'll see you around then.

537
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,660
Let's go.

538
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,660
-That was pretty easy.
-Those jerks.

539
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,700
-Sang-hwan.
-What?

540
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,430
Your father's connections may be helpful,

541
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,040
but I can't be friends with you.

542
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,070
I understand. Let's go.

543
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,180
-Where to?
-The karaoke room.

544
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,780
You guys are going, right?

545
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,810
The karaoke room?
The karaoke room?

546
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,180
Let's go!

547
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,420
Let's go!

548
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,060
Let's go! Sang-hwan's paying.

549
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,520
Let's go to the karaoke room!

550
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,840
Mr. Im!

551
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,000
Yes, sir?

552
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,940
It's quite hard work, isn't it?

553
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,250
No, not at all.

554
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,250
It may be difficult at first.

555
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,180
If you hang in there,
you'll soon get used things.

556
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,120
I did some manual labor
when I lived in Seoul.

557
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,590
Mr. Im, I turned 72 years old
this year.

558
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,830
I've been raising cows here
for 50 years now.

559
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,330
Just by looking into the eyes of
people or cows,

560
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,000
I can get an idea of what type of
person or cow I'm dealing with.

561
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,240
You seem like a naive person.

562
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,170
Your eyes look like the eyes of a cow.

563
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,040
That's why I hired you.

564
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,850
I'm grateful.

565
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:50,180
You should know that you're
extremely blessed.

566
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,690
-Excuse me?
-You've been

567
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,720
specially chosen by our
Spiritual Father.

568
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,020
What do you mean, sir?

569
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,630
Why don't you go to the chapel
with me?

570
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,960
The chapel?

571
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,530
Spiritual Father has asked me to
bring you.

572
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,240
Then I'll see you later.

573
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,070
Yes, sir.

574
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,620
(Our wishes will be fulfilled.)

575
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,520
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

576
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,260
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

577
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,330
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

578
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,090
-Mr. Jo.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

579
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,600
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

580
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,410
(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

581
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,900
Brethren.

582
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,770
Brethren?

583
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,570
Brethren.

584
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,770
Watch your head.
There you go.

585
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,580
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

586
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,580
Brethren.

587
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,580
Here we are.

588
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,450
Let go. Let go of me.
Get your hands off of me.

589
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,290
Get your hands off of me!

590
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,660
Is this the police station?

591
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,360
Brethren.

592
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,930
I'll wash you and make you clean.
Why don't you take off your clothes?

593
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,600
What do you think you're doing?

594
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,670
How dare you lay your hands on me?

595
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,500
Where am I? Why are you telling
me to take off my clothes?

596
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,340
You're at Guseonwon.

597
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,010
I'm here to look after you.

598
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,370
Do you understand me?

599
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,980
Do you like men?

600
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,720
I must be right.

601
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,790
Go right ahead.

602
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,020
Do as you please, you jerk.

603
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,230
Are you playing games with me?

604
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,760
-Let's get you cleaned up.
-Get off of me!

605
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,030
How dare you lay your hands on me,
you filthy jerk?

606
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,450
You idiot.

607
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,790
You should've listened to me
when I said it nicely.

608
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,530
How dare you call me a filthy jerk,
you crazy scum?

609
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,980
I've been redeemed,
so I'm clean now.

610
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,750
If you keep saying I'm filthy,

611
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,290
I wouldn't like it so much.
Don't you think?

612
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,590
Gosh, it's hot.

613
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,430
I brought you here,

614
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,940
so you can turn over a new leaf.

615
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,770
Where is this place?

616
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,670
Since you cleansed your dirty body,

617
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,600
you should cleanse your soul too.

618
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,710
Only then, you can become a new man.

619
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,120
Gosh, it's okay. Please sit down.

620
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,620
I'm okay.

621
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,590
Please sit down.

622
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,030
Let's see. Do you feel
comfortable here?

623
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,100
Well...

624
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,230
Please help me.

625
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,000
That man is trying to kill me.

626
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,140
Please help me.

627
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,810
Here.

628
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,420
Please get up and sit down.
Sit down.

629
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,990
Please drink it while it's hot.

630
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,660
As long as your sins are alive,
your soul will die.

631
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,530
In other words,
your sins must die

632
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,300
for your soul to live.

633
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,170
What does that mean?

634
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,640
Please don't be

635
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,800
afraid of dying.

636
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,570
You should repent of your sins

637
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,240
and become a new man here,
where there is our Almighty.

638
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,420
I asked you to let me go.

639
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,490
Let me go, you crazy jerks!

640
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:00,950
Oh, gosh.

641
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,460
Spiritual Father.

642
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,370
You've spilled

643
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,370
the whole cup of tea.

644
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,140
Here. Let me fill it up again.

645
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,880
All right.

646
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,650
Please drink it.

647
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,420
Our Almighty

648
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,730
knows your each and every sin.

649
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,300
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

650
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,300
You must

651
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,570
confess and empty all of your sins.

652
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
If you do,

653
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,850
your new glass will be
filled with your new soul.

655
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,430
Don't be afraid,

656
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,330
and tell me.

657
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,660
You have to do that

658
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,130
to become

659
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,670
a new, clean man.

660
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,860
Forgive me.

661
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,130
I've committed a grave sin.

662
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:58,000
Mother!

663

664

Grandma wants you
to come home for dinner.

665
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,690
Stop with the nonsense,

666
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,930
and go buy some more alcohol for me.

667
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,880
You look just like your mom.

668
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:44,150
I know you're going to run away
once you get smarter.

669
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,050
Get lost now!

670
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,220
You shouldn't have been born
in the first place.

671
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,390
Whenever I see you,

672
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:58,060
I get so angry, you brat.

673
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,330
I hope you would just die!

(What kind of a father
doesn't know his own son's birthday?)

Grandma.

You earn chump change by collecting
boxes. Why did you order it?

679
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,460
It's okay. Let's go and eat it.

680
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,860
Oh, dear.

681
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,770
I can give you my everything.

682
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,440
I'm so sorry.

683
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,240
I'm sorry.

684
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,320
Grandma,

685
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,020
you're my favorite person
in the whole world.

686
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,690
So don't be sorry to me.

687
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,190
Okay?

688
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,130
-Okay. Let's go and eat.
-All right.

689
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,440
Hurry up and eat.

690
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,200
Okay.

691
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:21,850
Gosh. Is jjajangmyeon enough
for your birthday?

692
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,480
It's really delicious.

693
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,750
Aren't you going to eat?

694
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,620
I have mine. Eat up.

695
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,190
Okay.

696
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,260
Here, eat some.

697
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,260
That's right.

698
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:35,290
Dad.

699
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,300
You're here. Have you eaten?

700
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,230
Yes, what about you?

701
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,300
Your mom should eat first.

702
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,170
-Give it to me. I'll do it.
-What? Okay.

703
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,550
You're eating well.

704
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,090
I know this is hard for you.

705
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,150
No, I'm fine.

706
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,320
It'd be hard for Mom, not me.

707
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,430
Your mom is a strong person.

708
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,500
You should go home now.

709
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,870
You'll be busy with work tomorrow.

710

Are you worried about me?

711
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,410
You should be healthy
if you want to be the governor.

712
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,910
You're right.

713
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:30,420
Mom.

714
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,480
Here.

722
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,450
Gosh. Hello, sir.

723
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,850
You brought some new people today.

724
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,920
This is Apostle Kang Eun-sil
of Guseonwon.

725
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,890
She's the most beautiful woman
in Muji-gun.

726
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,860
You're embarrassing me.

727
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:28,800
And that's the best worker
of Guseonwon,

Apostle Jo Wan-tae.

729
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,940
I'm flattered.

00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,910
Is Spiritual Father inside?

731
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,780
Yes, of course.
Please come inside.

732
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:44,520
This right here is paradise.
This is paradise indeed.

733

-Welcome.
-Hello.

735
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,680
Go ahead. You should drink it
while it's warm.

736
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,280
This isn't just any tea.

737
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,810
This tea was made with
the Living Water that Spiritual Father

738
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,620
actually laid his hands on.

739
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,250
-Excuse me?
-It means "Father of the Spirits".

740
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,720
Our pastor here is more than
just a clergy to us.

741
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,090
He's like a spiritual father to us.

742
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,960
I see.

743
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,530
Sir, shall we play a simple game
of matching cards?

744
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,230
You must want to give me some
pocket money.

745
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,940
Spiritual Father, I'll be leaving now.

746
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,810
All right. I hope you earn
a lot of pocket money.

747
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,540
Thank you.

748
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,690
Your children have truly clean spirits.

749
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,430
What is your name?

750
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,160
My name is Im Sang-mi.

751
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,130
My name is Im Sang-jin.

752
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,070
How old are you two?

753
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,270
They're 17 years old.

754
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,580
They're binovular twins.

755
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,280
Goodness. I see.

756
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,750
It's no wonder they look somewhat alike.

757
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,290
Almighty's grace is truly astonishing.

758
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,460
Don't you agree, Apostle Kang?

759
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,090
Yes, indeed.

760
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,460
They're all priceless gifts Almighty
has sent to us.

761
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:57,180
Spiritual Father has given his word.

762
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,280
I'll drop by the cattle shed
tomorrow to meet you.

763
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:04,390
If you don't mind me asking,
how could he

764
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,260
so willingly insist on finding us
a place to live?

765
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,960
It's because Almighty is with us.

766
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,000
Excuse me?

767
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,000
That is that faith the Almighty
has given us.

768
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,770
"Love the neighbors
like the family."

769
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,540
That's what Spiritual Father

770
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,740
always preaches to us and practices
himself.

771
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,610
I see.

772
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:31,880
Then we should get going now.

773
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,250
Okay.

774
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:34,890
Thank you.

775
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,640
-Honey.
-Yes?

776
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,210
Are you really going to do this?

777
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:36,380
You don't like the idea?

778
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,150
No, it's not that.

779
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,590
The fact that it's not like
a common church does worry me.

780
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,320
They didn't seem like strange
people though.

781
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,030
In order for the kids to attend school,

782
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,160
wouldn't it be better to have
a decent home to live in?

783
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,470
-Dad.
-Yes?

784
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,540
Couldn't we just live in a container

785
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,440
and move out when we have the
money to find a new place?

786
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,170
Sang-jin, what do you think?

787
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,010
I think it'll be all right.

788
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:06,650
Really?

789
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,510
Yes. They seemed like nice people,

790
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,620
and I liked how they prayed for us.

791
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,160
You are able to open the eyes
of the blind

792
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,160
and heal those who are crippled.

793
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,830
Our dear Almighty.

794
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:27,230
Please comfort Sang-jin's
wounded body and soul.

795
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:30,100
Please heal him.

796
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,640
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

797
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,450
Sang-mi is beautiful
like porcelain

798
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,520
and as fragrant as balm.

799
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,360
Our Almighty's blessing be with us.

800
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,200
Please help this family.

801
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,770
What's that car doing?

802
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,410
What's wrong with that car?

803
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,800
(SAVE ME)

804
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,640
Apologize to him.

805
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,010
If you don't apologize this instant,
I'll report you to the police.

806
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,850
Then you'll have to give me money
to get this dry-cleaned first.

807
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,550
You guys harassed him first.

808
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,820
Do you have proof?

809
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,750
Hey guys. If any of you guys

810
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,690
saw me harassing this guy,
come forward.

811
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,500
If you come any closer,
I'll beat all of you guys up.
