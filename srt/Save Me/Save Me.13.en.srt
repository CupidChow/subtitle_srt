(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,770
(I think my dad joined hands with
that cult leader.)

3
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,200
(Sang-mi and I will have
a spiritual wedding)

4
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,140
(where we will become one.)

5
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,740
("Don't ever come back"?)

6
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,540
(Do you think
this is a warning or a threat?)

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,380
(Who are you?)

8
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,180
(I just know that she's
an undercover journalist.)

9
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,980
(We can't just go in there.)

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,050
(We need to get out of here.)

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,690
(-Sister Kim.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!)

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,250
(I'll save everyone.)

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,420
(I'm going to destroy this place
no matter what.)

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,090
(Sang-mi!)

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,830
(This tranquilizer can even knock
down an elephant with just one shot.)

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,770
(Mom! Apostle Kang gave my mom
an injection.)

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,900
(I'll look into what that could've been.)

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,440
(Who knew he'd find a dead body too?
We found a wallet)

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,840
(-right beside the body.
-Please find my granddaughter.)

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,910
(There was a social security
card inside.)

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,539
(What on earth are you guys up to?)

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,210
(You're doing all this
because I look like the girl you killed?)

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,820
(Is that why you chose me
and my family?)

24
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,050
(If you keep this up,)

25
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,520
(I might have to change my ways.)

26
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:41,460
(EPISODE 13)

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,270
Try all you want,

28
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,240
and scream for help.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,940
Here, there's only one person
who can save you.

30
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,280
Me.

31
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,910
There's no one else.

32
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,060
Are you saying

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,030
you're doing all this
because I look like the girl you killed?

34
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,170
Is that why you chose me and my family?

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,740
If you keep this up,

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,880
I might have to change my ways.

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,150
Please, just a second.

38
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,460
Now, I know

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,360
that you can

40
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,829
do whatever you want to do
to me whenever you please.

41
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,240
So please

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,870
I promise I won't run away.

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,650
If this is really my fate,

44
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,520
please help me

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,950
accept you with all of my heart.

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,430
I need just a little more time.

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,630
Can I

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,040
really trust you?

49
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,140
Yes.

50
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,220
Good.

51
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,450
Until the day the fruit will ripen
to perfection,

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,260
I will wait.

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,770
Are you okay?

54
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,170
Where am I?

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,910
You should never swallow the pills
Apostle Kang gives you from now on.

56
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,610
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,510
Listen to me if you want to save Sang-mi.

58
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,110
Don't forget this.

59
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,890
Sister Kim seems to be awake now.

60
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,500
Please help her get up.

61
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,040
Do you know where you are?

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,250
Paradise.

63
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,280
The place where my dear Sang-jin is.

64
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,720
Yes, that's right.

65
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,320
Would you like to take your medicine now?

66
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,730
Open up.

67
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,640
There you go.

68
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,780
You have to take the medicine
so you won't get sick again.

69
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,020
Good job.

70
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,920
Please get some rest now. Okay?

71
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,490
Salvation.

72
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,660
Eternal life.

73
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,800
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

74
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,240
Are you okay?

75
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,040
Yes.

76
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,710
You didn't look good
when you walked out of there.

77
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm fine.

78
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,150
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,820
-I caused trouble to you all.
-Don't be.

80
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,920
We've always been like this.

81
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,730
Dong-cheol, what are you doing over there?

82
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,840
I ran into her after using the toilet.
I was asking her something.

83
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,180
Asking her what?

84
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,190
She seemed to be around my age,

85
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,090
so I asked her
which elementary school she went to.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,670
Spiritual Mother.
Where are you going?

87
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,540
To see my mom.

88
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,610
Please go inside.

89
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,650
You're not supposed to see
your mom for a while.

90
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,710
Okay.

91
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,720
-Dong-cheol.
-Yes?

92
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,159
You shouldn't talk
to Spiritual Mother casually like that.

93
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,100
I just thought she's around my age--

94
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,200
She is a very special person
to everyone in Guseonwon.

95
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,100
Please be careful from now on.

96
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,640
Okay.

97
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,570
By the way, why is she special?

98
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,180
You're curious about so many things.

99
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,550
I have to ask
if I'm curious about something.

100
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,650
All right.

101
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,420
She's someone who will cleanse us of
our original sin.

102
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,960
She's taking a 40-day
spiritual training now.

103
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,730
If she speaks to someone
who is spiritually inadequate,

104
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,360
it will disrupt her spirit.

105
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,230
That's why you shouldn't
talk to her like you did earlier.

106
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,430
Do you understand?

107
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,040
Yes. I'm very sorry.

108
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,890
(Did you want to see me?)

109
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,690
(If you keep doing this,)

110
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,700
(I may have to change my ways.)

111
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,510
These are all proof that
apocalypse is near.

112
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,450
Would you waste your life while drinking

113
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,450
just like other people
when apocalypse is upon us?

114
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,820
Or would you get ready
for the day of salvation here?

115
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,190
We should get ready
for the day of salvation.

116
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,960
That's right.

117
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,330
Everyone, do you believe
that Almighty will save us?

118
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,700
-We believe it.
-We believe it.

119
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,440
Let's believe it.

120
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,210
All right, that's all for today.

121
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,040
All together now.
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

122
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,040
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

123
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,240
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

124
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,410
Thank you.

125
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,620
If you go outside, you'll see the van.

126
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,780
Please get on it.

127
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,350
All right.

128
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,360
-Dong-cheol.
-Yes?

129
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,290
Can I talk to you for a second?

130
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,160
Sure.

131
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,100
-Bye.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

132
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,270
What is it?

133
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,870
I heard you've met
with Spiritual Father alone before.

134
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,540
Oh, I took the wrong way then.

135
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,550
I was startled because I thought
I would really become blind,

136
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,520
but I didn't.

137
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,260
That's because you have
a clear and pure soul.

138
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,690
If you work hard to train
your spirituality,

139
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,030
you can win the first-class ticket
to the Boat of Salvation.

140
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,930
You have to do your best
during the training camp, okay?

141
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Well...

142
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,400
I'm not sure about staying in a camp.

143
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,410
Don't you want to go to the paradise?

144
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,280
I do, but...

145
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,650
Depending on how deep your faith is,

146
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,650
your parents can get on
the Boat of Salvation too.

147
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,750
Are you going to let your loved ones

148
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,020
fall into the fire pit?

149
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,950
I'm not.

150
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,160
When will the training camp start?

151
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,790
It will start tomorrow.

152
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,890
Tomorrow?

153
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Okay.

154
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,700
(GUSEONWON)

155
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,340
Apostle Kang.

156
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,310
I should go outside tonight
because of a family affair.

157
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,180
What family affair?

158
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,680
It's my mom's birthday today.

159
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,520
The evil can disguise itself as
your family and tempt you.

160
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,330
I know.

161
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,330
You need to assist Spiritual Mother,
so come back before

162
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,370
the morning worship.

163
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,970
Okay. Our wishes will be fulfilled.

164
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,380
Gosh, it's nice to have
many young people.

165
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,650
I wish my grandson would come
to Guseonwon like you.

166
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,820
Is he still the same?

167
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,790
He wanted to be a soccer player
when he was going to the church.

168
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,190
Don't get me started.

169
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,560
He's completely possessed by
the evil computer.

170
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,660
Gosh, Almighty.

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,330
It sounds like you two
went to a different church together.

172
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,870
That's right. We went to
the same church for 30 years

173
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,340
and left that place to come here.

174
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,580
That means How should I say it?

175
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,880
We're the living proof.

176
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,280
I see.

177
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,020
After leaving your church,

178
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,450
why did you come here?

179
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,490
Spiritual Father's sermon is
different from other pastors.

180
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,860
He's gifted, so other people are
jealous of him.

181
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,700
That's why they made up a false rumor.

182
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,270
What rumor?

183
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,970
They say Spiritual Father did
something to a girl

184
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,870
Goodness, have you gone senile?

185
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,910
Why are you saying things
the demons would say?

186
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,950
Stop it because it's bad
for the new believers.

187
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,850
People are always jealous of
the person who is better than them.

188
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,050
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

189
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,090
They're all demons' doings.

190
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,030
(GUSEONWON)

191
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,470
-Thank you.
-Are you getting off here?

192
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,770
-Get home safely.
-All right. Bye.

193
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,630
Thank you.

194
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,980
-Are you looking for someone?
-Is there a guy who's here alone?

195
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,050
He's been drinking beer for two hours.

196
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,380
Hey.

197
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,320
Ma'am,
I'd like a draft beer, please.

198
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,720
What? Ma'am?

199
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,660
What is wrong with her?
She's probably only a few years my junior.

200
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,530
I'm sorry to have kept you
waiting so long.

201
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,360
Gosh, who do you think you are?

202
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,500
I can't believe you're
bossing me around like this.

203
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,870
Go easy on me, please.
It was so hard for me to leave that place.

204
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,470
Did you look into it?

205
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,640
Here.

206
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,980
It must be prescribed by a physician.

207
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,150
When given every day, even normal people
will become stupid.

208
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,020
Are you sure they're giving it
to people there?

209
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,860
It's not like this is some vitamins.

210
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,330
I'm not too sure yet,

211
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,900
but I think they're giving it
to more than one patient.

212
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,630
I think you really need
to get out of there now.

213
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,700
Request an interview,
and send the evidence to the police

214
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,770
No.

215
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,970
-Why not?
-This isn't enough.

216
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,740
I'm sure they already bribed the doctor.

217
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,140
Even if they get caught,
they'll probably be able to get out of it.

218
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,880
So-rin, are you being this risky
because you want to move to Seoul?

219
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,150
This is just my hunch,

220
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,620
but I don't think it's a simple alliance

221
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,720
between a religion
and the political circle.

222
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,830
-Then what is it?
-Muji will be thrown upside down.

223
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,960
Actually, it may affect
the entire country.

224
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,530
Drink up, ma'am.

225
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,940
Sorry?

226
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,940
Sang-mi is on the second floor
of this main building,

227
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
and her mom is

228
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,880
on the fifth floor of the sanitarium.
It's tense there too.

229
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,150
Gosh, it's literally surrounded
by the mountains.

230
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,620
No one will even know
even if someone dies.

231
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,820
And have a look at this.

232
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,190
This route through the mountains

233
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,130
is the quickest way downtown.

234
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,590
Can we just leave
through the main entrance?

235
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,500
Many people walk in and out
of there throughout the day,

236
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,830
so it's a bit dangerous.

237
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,430
Give it to me.

238
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,070
If we're using a car and motorcycles,

239
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,910
this route will be the quickest.

240
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,750
Dong-cheol.

241
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,520
Is Sang-mi doing well?

242
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,250
Hey, what kind of question is that?
How can she be doing well?

243
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,920
All right. "Dong-cheol,
Sang-mi must doing horrible there."

244
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,790
Was I supposed to ask like that instead?

245
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,230
Regular believers can't
really meet her,

246
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,300
so I haven't had a chance to talk to her,

247
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,730
but it looks like she's staying strong.

248
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,240
I decided to live there
with them for the next little while.

249
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,970
What?

250
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,880
Hey, are you out of your mind?
Why would you do that?

251
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,180
We don't have much time.

252
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,510
Dong-cheol, I'm worried that
something might happen to you.

253
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,420
Just tell them you're too tired,
and sleep at home.

254
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,720
I agree. Going in too deep

255
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,620
might expose you to more danger.

256
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,560
We should do everything we can.

257
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,730
They're asking 2,000 dollars from newbies
and making them stay there,

258
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,130
saying that it's part of
their training program.

259
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,730
2,000 dollars is a lot.
Do you even have that much money?

260
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,280
All right. I'll see what I can do.

261
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,280
Well, we should give Jeong-hun some
credit for what he found out today.

262
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,820
Gosh, you didn't have to bring that up.
You're making me blush.

263
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,420
I found out where they were
before coming to Muji.

264
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,960
Where were they?

265
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,490
Near Daegu.

266
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,830
I'm going to go there and check it out.
I should be able to find

267
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,600
some clues to figure out what
they did there and who they are.

268
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,670
Oh, I think the leader
used to be a pastor.

269
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,470
-Pastor?
-Yes.

270
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,240
A few believers told me that
they used to go to his church.

271
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,180
They didn't get into details,
but I think he had problems with women.

272
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,850
This isn't his first time.
I bet he's done this many times.

273
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,980
By any chance, did they tell you
the name of the church?

274
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,190
No, that's all they told me.

275
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,860
All right. I might be able to find
the church when I'm there.

276
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,060
Oh, I heard that a detective
from Muji Police Station came by.

277
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,470
Apparently, he spoke with the leader
and even saw Sang-mi.

278
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,230
What? Hey.

279
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,600
He didn't believe a word we said.
What changed his mind?

280
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,440
I wonder what he and Sang-mi
talked about.

281
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,740
I should look into it.

282
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,480
Dad, are you still sleeping?

283
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,350
Is he not home yet?

284
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,390
He's never done that before.
What's gotten into him?

285
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,160
I told you to make sure
he doesn't drink today.

286
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,530
Why are you blaming me?

287
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,500
Dad.

288
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,570
Dad.

289
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,910
Gosh, you should've just said
that you're still in bed.

290
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,610
Dad.

291
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,210
Dad. Dad!

292
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,750
What's wrong with him?

293
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,890
I think he's dead.

294
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,590
The land registry documents
should be okay, right?

295
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,770
They're gone.

296
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,940
That can't be.

297
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,210
Does that mean he gave them
our house registry papers too?

298
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,150
That con artist.
I'll kill you today.

299
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,090
Please don't do this.
You cannot go in.

300
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,820
-You can't do this.
-Let go of me!

301
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,390
Please don't do this.

302
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,990
Are you the pastor here?

303
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,890
Yes, it's that man. I've seen him.

304
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,830
Please calm down.

305
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,660
How can we help you?

306
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,200
You want to know why I'm here?
You crook.

307
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,100
Do you even know how much money
my dad has donated to this place?

308
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,710
How dare you steal our house
and land registry papers too?

309
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,740
You guys are complete trash.

310
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,310
Please calm down. It looks like
there was a misunderstanding.

311
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,810
Misunderstanding, my foot!

312
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,910
Where is your father?

313
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,380
He didn't come to the service
this morning.

314
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,420
I'll visit him at home.

315
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,120
You'll visit him?
He passed away this morning!

316
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,260
-What?
-You can't cause a scene here.

317
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,560
-Gosh!
-My goodness!

318
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,560
Congratulations.

319
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,630
Your father finally got on
the Boat of Salvation.

320
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,940
Everyone, do you believe
that Brother Yun

321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,910
has ascended to the paradise?

322
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,610
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

323
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,080
My gosh, Almighty has shown us
his loving kindness.

324
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,240
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

325
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:27,150
I should pray hard so that I can
get on the Boat of Salvation too.

326
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,050
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

327
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,890
-Congratulations.
-My gosh, congratulations.

328
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,730
Don't be sad.

329
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,870
Don't be angry.

330
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,940
And please let him go.

331
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,840
He chose it for your sake,

332
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,410
not because he wanted to go
to the paradise alone.

333
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,750
He loved you

334
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,720
more than his own son.

335
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,760
How do you know that?

336
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,360
Honey, what is he saying?

337
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,840
Apostle Jo.

338
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,540
Yes.

339
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,240
Has his father ever

340
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,610
brought such documents
as a donation to us?

341
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,250
Apostle Jo, please make sure

342
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,320
Spiritual Father gets this.

343
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,060
Yes. He said he wanted to donate
them as a special offering.

344
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,760
Give it back to him.

345
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm sorry?

346
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,600
His father is already in the paradise.

347
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,630
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

348
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,940
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

349
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,310
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

350
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,910
His special offering

351
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,580
does not mean anything now.

352
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,220
Spiritual Father.

353
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,190
How can you be so sure that his father

354
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,490
went to the paradise?

355
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,500
Apostle Jo.

356
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,140
My words are the words of Almighty.

357
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,010
Do you doubt that?

358
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,350
Do I doubt that? Of course not.

359
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,150
I believe it.

360
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,180
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

361
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,420
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-I believe it.

362
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,720
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

365
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Hello.

366
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,310
He's over there.

367
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,250
He's been there like that
since this morning. Take him, please.

368
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,490
Goodness, he stinks.

369
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,990
Sir, please wake up.

370
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,060
You shouldn't be lying down
on the ground like this.

371
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,130
We'll take you to a more
comfortable place.

372
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,800
Please get up. Goodness.

373
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,310
Gosh, what in the world did you eat?

374
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,320
Hi, Sergeant Woo.

375
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,520
How have you been?

376
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,160
Great. Thank you for your hard work
at this late hour.

377
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,800
-Please wait.
-Okay.

378
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,970
-Get off.
-Where am I?

379
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,140
Come on.

380
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,170
-Where is this place? Wait.
-Gosh.

381
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,640
Come on. My gosh.

382
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,250
What is this place?

383
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,650
-He's still a little drunk.
-Where am I?

384
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,350
Let go of me. I don't want to go.

385
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,120
Please take good care of him.

386
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,090
Don't worry about anything.

387
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,820
He will find salvation
and have a new life here.

388
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,560
-I'll be going then.
-Wait, Sergeant Woo.

389
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,760
Goodness, you don't have to.

390
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,870
You need to stay healthy
so that you can support

391
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,640
your wife and son. Am I right?

392
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,910
I shouldn't keep accepting
these things from you.

393
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,780
Don't worry. Nobody knows.

394
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,540
All right.

395
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,640
I should pay for
Jeong-hun's college tuition

396
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,650
and buy him a house
when he gets married as his dad.

(MUJI POLICE STATION)

398
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,430
What are you doing here?

399
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,960
I know that it's troublesome
and difficult for the police

400
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,300
to investigate a religious group.

401
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm also aware that

402
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,870
they won't obediently agree

403
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,570
to go through the investigation.

404
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,690
Get up now.

405
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,990
You just said you know all that.

406
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,790
I do know,
but please don't tell me

407
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,260
to stay quiet and do nothing.

408
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,460
If it was your daughter
who was taken by swindlers,

409
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,630
would you still tell me to do nothing?

410
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,040
People are looking at us
suspiciously because of you.

411
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,340
Why are you doing this to me?

412
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,280
Frankly, I

413
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,310
hate you.

414
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,850
I don't trust you either.

415
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,950
You did the same thing to Dong-cheol,

416
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,250
and you also sent Sang-mi back
to that place.

417
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,120
But I need you now.

418
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,860
I really need a chief detective who can

419
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,200
investigate Guseonwon.

420
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,440
Look.

421
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,310
I'm not interested.

422
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,010
So you can either go back now,

423
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,310
or stay here like this.
Do as you like.

424
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,810
When you went to Guseonwon,

425
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,220
why did you meet Sang-mi?

426
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,150
You know that

427
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,220
what Sang-mi told you isn't true.

428
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,660
-So?
-I will

429
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,130
give you information
that you'd be interested in.

430
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,540
Fine, get up. Get up now, you brat.

431
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,910
Okay then.

432
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,650
Please come with me.

433
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,750
What?

434
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,980
I thought we were doing this.
Aren't you coming?

435
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,820
Where? Hey.

436
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,190
That crazy punk. He's insane.

437
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,190
Hey.

438
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,960
I'm not going anywhere.

439
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,430
Don't you want to check the information?

440
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,660
Are you kidding me?

441
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,000
I don't know what you're going to do.
Why would I follow you?

442
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,970
It's about Kim Hye-eun, the woman
who went missing and died,

443
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,310
and the one you're investigating on now.

444
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,280
As far as I know, she often argued
with her grandmother

445
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,650
because she asked for 2,000 dollars
to go to the paradise.

446
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,050
How did you know that?

447
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,650
Muji is a much smaller place
than you think.

448
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,990
You've found a dead body.
It's natural that rumors spread.

449
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,500
In order for believers to face
Spiritual Father in Guseonwon,

450
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,330
they have to complete
the basic spiritual training first.

451
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,970
They need 2,000 dollars
to take that training.

452
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,910
She said she must
go to the paradise or something.

453
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,340
She begged me to lend her 2,000 dollars.

454
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,810
How do you know so much
about Guseonwon?

455
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,720
I'll tell you as we go.

456
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,820
That brat.

457
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,490
It will remove the toxin in your body.

458
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,400
You have to drink all of it.

459
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,330
That's the rotten mass of sin

460
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,300
that has been inside of you.

461
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,900
Cough up all of it.

462
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,780
Is this

463
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,550
what you want, Apostle Kang?

464
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,110
Is this what you want, Mom?

465
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,180
It's something he wants, not you.

466
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,250
Mom, please don't let him deceive you.

467
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,830
This Living Water
given by Spiritual Father will

468
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,130
make you feel better.

469
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,370
Please drink it.

(DAEGU)

471
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,850
Was it that way? Oh, I remember now.

472
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,190
There will be a real estate agency
if we turn left at the intersection.

473
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,460
He says it's near there.

474
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,230
Aren't you going to go?

475
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,660
Do you want to become a detective?

476
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,670
No.

477
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,770
What then?

478
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,400
A prosecutor.

479
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,040
You're being a little rude.

480
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,910
Me?

481
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,410
Just wear your seatbelt.

482
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,680
Hello.

00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,190

484
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,590
Thank you.

485

Please come in.

486
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,260
It's definitely a cult.

487
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,740
Is it okay to record our conversation?

488
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,070
Well, sure.

489
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,880
It's true that this man worked here
as a pastor before, right?

490
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,850
Yes, it's true.

491
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,560
To think of that time...
My goodness.

492
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,690
Did he do anything else other than
embezzle the church's money?

493
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,030
It was fake.

494
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,030
-What was fake?
-After some investigation,

495
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,370
we found out that his certificate
of ordination was fake.

496
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,430
He's such an eloquent speaker.

497
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,240
So we got fooled by what he said.

498
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,040
By the way, did he ever

499
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,310
sexually molest female believers?

500
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,250
We already heard about it
before coming here.

501
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,880
So please don't hide anything,
and tell us.

502
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,090
Don't you think we should
get rid of all religious cults?

503
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,990
Well, there was one believer who was

504
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,390
particularly close with him.

505
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,000
And apparently, they were in
a special relationship.

506
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,170
-Am I right?
-Yes.

507
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,240
There was a pretty-looking apostle
whose job was a nurse.

508
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,940
And whenever her husband drank

509
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,840
Whenever he got drunk, he would beat her.

510
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,740
So they must've grown close to each other

511
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,910
as he prayed for her
and listened to her hardships.

512
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,850
Do you remember her name?

513
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,620
I just remember her as Apostle Kang.

514
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,790
Do you remember how she looked?

515
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,260
She was pretty.

516
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,860
She had big eyes and plump lips.

517
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,260
She seems cold-hearted
from the outside.

518
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,200
But she looks really nice
when she smiles.

519
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,630
I don't know why

520
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,770
she had to get involved with
a guy like that.

521
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,110
Then do you know a guy who's
always with him?

522
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,280
He has long eyes, and he has a perm
like a middle-aged woman.

523
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,850
Oh, it seems like you're
talking about Apostle Jo.

524
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,120
Yes, he is.

525
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,389
He came with that pastor
ever since he started serving here.

526
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,820
And there was also a big guy

527
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:23,260
who couldn't talk. From what I know,
he was his stepbrother.

528
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,260
They were all so friendly.

529
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,030
So they had everyone
on their side in no time.

530
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,199
They were so influential.

531
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,630
After I started serving here,
I examined our church's accounts.

532
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,940
And I found out that our church had
ended up with a huge amount of debt.

533
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,639
He even took out a private loan,
so that already explains everything.

534
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,480
Are you still going to tell me to
stand still?

535
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,920
Give me some time to think.

536
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:56,560
I can't stand still.
No, I won't stand still.

537
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,130
My friend's going to broadcast
the conversation we just had.

538
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,630
What? What are you talking about?

539
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,800
We also have a plan of our own.

540
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,300
My gosh.

541
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,210
You said you sent
your friend there, right?

542
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,810
Yes.

543
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,840
Then ask him to find out the name of
the old woman

544
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,240
who followed that
cult leader to Guseonwon.

545
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,610
Why?

546
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,850
I first need to confirm the facts.

547
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,250
Broadcast, my foot.

548
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,550
Where in Muji will you be
able to broadcast this?

549
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,790
My gosh. Ma'am.

550
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,430
It must be heavy.
I'll carry that for you.

551
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,030
My goodness. Thank you.

552
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,540
May our Almighty bless you.

553
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,140
Drink some water.

554
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,640
-Thank you.
-Gosh, it's hot.

555
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,280
The water tastes so nice.

556
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,320
It's because this water is from a spring

557
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,490
that was blessed by
our Spiritual Father's prayers.

558
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,090
By the way, what's your name?

559
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,560
My name?

560
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,360
Why would you want to know
an old woman's name?

561
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,330
You remind me of my late grandmother.

562
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,270
My name is Park Sun-nyeo.

563
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,340
Your name is very pretty.

564
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,310
From now on, you should also
pray diligently.

565
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,950
Then you'll be able to meet
your grandmother in paradise.

566
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,320
Okay?

567
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,290
Okay.

568
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,960
Good.

(PARK SUN-NYEO)

570
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,350
You should lie down.

571
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,840
I checked with my colleague at work.

572
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,340
And it turns out that the pill

573
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,740
they've been giving to your mother
was a psychotropic drug.

574
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,480
We just need to find proof to show
that it was also given to others.

575
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,810
Then the police and prosecution

576
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,980
won't be able to stay quiet.

577
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,450
So please hang in there.

578
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,990
I need to go now. Apostle Kang
told me to come see her.

579
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,160
Wait.

580
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,800
I have one more favor to ask of you.

581
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,280
Please give this

582
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,880

I'm slowly starting to see hope.

586
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,620
I thought nobody would ever listen to me.

About Sang-mi...

Don't worry.

Sang-mi

595
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,890
will soon get married to Spiritual Father.

so grateful that we were
able to come here.

599
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,180
This was all a divine message
of our Almighty.

600
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,550
Everything happened so that he could
bless Sang-mi to become

601
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,080
the Spiritual Mother.

602
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,250

Did you give Living Water
to our soon-to-be Spiritual Mother?

Yes.

608

Are you happy with your current duty?

609

Yes, I'm very grateful towards
our Almighty.

610
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,910
What did you say your job was

611
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,350
before you came to Guseonwon?

612
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,550
I was getting ready to
go to graduate school.

613
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,990
But then, I met our Almighty
and realized my path.

614
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,090
I see.

615
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,130

-We're the police.
-Pardon?

619
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,430
All this land used to belong
to Park Sun-nyeo.

620
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,560
Does that mean this land doesn't
belong to her anymore?

621
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,830
It was planned to go under
reconstruction,

622
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,130
so she sold it a few years ago.

623
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,170
Then can you check
who owns this land at the moment?

Yes, of course.

625

Yes, I was right.
The owner had changed.

626
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,180
Does it belong to Baek Jeong-gi?

627
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,490
No. It belongs to Jo Wan-tae.

00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,310
Hello, sir.

648
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,450
Thank you for doing your best
to keep Muji safe.

649
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,380
How have you been?

650
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,220
-Yes, of course.
-Hi, Apostle Jo.

651
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,960
Our Spiritual Father has
high expectations of you.

652
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,390
Yes. I'll schedule a date soon.

653
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,330
Okay, bye.

654
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,800
Wan-tae, why haven't you
visited these days?

655
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,300
Did you miss me?

656
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,440
Of course, I missed you.

657
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,070
Hey.

658
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,080
My gosh, look at you.

659
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,780
Salute! I'm Prisoner 4884, sir.

660
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,210
It's good to see you, Mr. Jo.

661
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:17,820
Hey, are you still scamming people?

662
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,090
What are you talking about?

663
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,620
I'm really behaving myself these days.

664
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,990
You little...

665
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,700
You obviously served time for violence.

666
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,400
Who said you could
talk to me like I'm your friend?

667
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,540
Guys like you think everything's
over once you get out of prison.

668
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,480
But life's not that simple.

669
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,850
I heard you became a prison guard
for that Spiritual Father.

670
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,010
So you must still think
this place is prison.

671
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,380
Why are you acting up
in my neighborhood?

672
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,950
My gosh, stop it.

673
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,450
Why are you guys doing this?

674
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,750
You're cute.

675
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,890
There's a place called Guseonwon.
It only takes 20 minutes from town.

676
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,800
It's a very nice church,
so you should come visit.

677
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,700
I'll help you clear all your sins.

678
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,530
You should go to paradise.

679
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:09,940
"Paradise"?

680
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,440
"Guseonwon"? Wait a minute.

681
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,310
Oh, yes. I remember now.

682
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,980
That place is being broadcasted
on the internet these days.

683
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,710
Is that where you work?

684
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,750
What do you mean?

685
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,090
(PLEASE REPORT TO US)

686
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,270
(PLEASE REPORT TO US)

687
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,300
(SEND A MEMO)

688
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,440
Okay.

689
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,580
So you're waiting for reports, are you?

690
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,380
Are you the informant?

691
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,850
Yes, yes. Thank you.

692
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:03,690
Oh, you used to go to a church in Daegu
that just got broadcasted?

693
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,730
Gosh, no wonder.
That must be why you called.

694
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,390
Oh, I see.

695
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,260
There's more?

696
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,030
Let's go.

697
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,740
(ALMSGIVING : ALMIGHTY, PLEASE
PREVENT MY SON FROM GETTING SICK)

698
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,820
(ALMSGIVING : ALMIGHTY, PLEASE
HELP MY SON STAY HEALTHY)

699
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,050
(ALMSGIVING : ALMIGHTY, PLEASE
HELP ME AND MY SON GO TO PARADISE)

700
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,060
My gosh, why are you
drinking soju by itself?

701
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,760
What's wrong?

702
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,830
Did you quit work?

703
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,310
You should eat something with it.
You'll hurt your stomach.

704
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,010
If you're going to keep doing this,
let's just die.

705
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,780
What?

706
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,780
Do you think this world will even

707
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,120
have a place for a guy like me
who got expelled for fighting?

708
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,860
No, you're wrong.

709
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,060
Dae-sik, there's a way.

710
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,560
It's Guseonwon.

711
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,800
Have you gone mad?

712
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,540
Was it not enough for you to spend

713
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,740
all your money on this place?

714
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,340
Did you even take out a private loan?

715
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,780
No, that's not it.

716
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,650
Things like money only make
our souls suffer.

717
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,650
Money is evil.

718
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,850
Please...

719
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,020
Please stop saying that.

720
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,130
Every time you say stuff like that,
I feel like I'm going to go crazy.

721
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,830
My gosh.

722
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,570
What's wrong?

723
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,470
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

724
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,440
My goodness. Gosh, my leg.

725
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,640
What's wrong?

726
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,640
It's nothing.

727
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,010
Did someone hit you?

728
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,580
No, no one hit me.

729
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,520
Was it those loan sharks?

730
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,550
No, it wasn't them.

731
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,360
Then who hit you?

732
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,060
Dae-sik, I didn't get these bruises
because someone hit me.

733
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,960
I got these from fire prayers.

734
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,630
And they're not bruises.
They're signs of sin.

735
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,640
I've committed so many sins.

736
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,070
That's why I get these
kind of bruises on my body.

737
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,180
No one beat me.

738
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,820
Dae-sik. Where are you going?

739
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,190
Dae-sik!

740
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,190
Hey, Man-hui. I came to meet an informant.

741
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,790
No, it's near my house.

742
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,130
I'm going to sleep at my house tonight.
I'll be there tomorrow.

743
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,770
No, I can't. My dad will kill me
if I don't go home today.

744
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,800
Okay. Tell Sang-hwan for me.

745
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,310
Okay, goodnight.
I'll bring you big news tomorrow.

746
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,670
Okay.

747
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,320
Hello? Are you the informant?

748
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,490
(GUSEONWON)

749
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,810
(TO SANG-HWAN)

750
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,130
(They've been feeding weird medicine
to my mom.)

751
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,200
(So-rin helped her stop taking
that medicine,)

752
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,230
(so her mind's slowly starting
to come back to normal.)

753
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,530
(If we find more evidence
on that medicine,)

754
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,670
(we might be able to
release it to the press.)

755
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,210
(And it wasn't the first time)

756
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:51,480
(that cult leader tried to make
someone into a Spiritual Mother.)

757
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,580
(I think he also raped
someone in the past.)

758
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,520
(I recorded everything
regarding that.)

759
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,620
(You'll be able to find out
about his sins)

760
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,590
(if you look into his past.)

761
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:05,360
(Then I think I'll be able
to destroy this place)

762
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,660
(and be free to get out of here.)

763
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,860
(You guys should also
be careful until then.)

764
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:20,840
I visited the church that
the old woman used to go to.

765
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,440
And I've confirmed that she and
her friends followed the cult leader.

766
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,850
On top of that, he bought
his certificate of ordination,

767
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,350
embezzled church money,

768
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,320
and had problems with
a female believer.

769
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,090
I finally get it now.

770
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,560
I think we'll be able to get him soon,
so wait for my contact.

771
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:43,630
Then we'll try to think of
your escape route

772
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,970
with the information you gave us.

773
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,150
I bet you're now realizing

774
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,380
whom you guys were messing with.

775
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,090
Who is it?

776
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,990
What do you mean?

777
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,830
Who's the rat that's been
snooping around with you?

778
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,500
Well I think you got the wrong idea.

779
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,670
I work alone.

780
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,710
I'll play with you later, okay?

781
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,470
You startled me.

782
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,170
Gosh, I almost jumped
out of my skin.

783
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,770
Dong-cheol, what brings you here?

784
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,940
I couldn't fall asleep
since it's my first night here,

785
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,140
so I came out for a walk.

786
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,510
I saw you and Brother Wan-deok

787
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,920
running into the forest,

788
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,050
so I followed you
because I was curious.

789
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,690
Dong-cheol, it looks like
you're a very curious person.

790
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,930
My friends always tell me
to stop being so nosy.

791
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,030
Let me give you a piece of advice
as I'm old enough to be your uncle.

792
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,500
Doing your own thing like this
isn't a good idea.

793
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,470
Don't do this again, okay?

794
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,010
The two of you seemed
to be in such a big hurry,

795
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:45,040
so I was just worried. I wanted
to see if I could help in any way.

796
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,650
My gosh, it's getting late.

797
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,880
-We should get back down.
-Pardon?

798
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,450
By the way,

799
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,750
-where's Brother Wan-deok?
-He already went back.

800
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,090
-Already?
-Yes. Let's go.

801
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,360
What's the matter?

802
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,470
Well, I think I just heard something.

803
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,740
Was it a cat?

804
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,680
Let's go.

805
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,690
By the way, where is Jeong-hun?

806
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:28,950
He said he's not coming today.

807
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,260
They said the spiritual wedding
would take place in 40 days, right?

808
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,990
Has it been about 10 days now?

809
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,330
40 days...

810
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,300
They won't expedite it, right?

811
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,200
-Let's hope that doesn't happen.
-Are you saying they might do it?

812
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,240
I'll wait for Almighty's message

813
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,510
to reschedule the date for the wedding.

814
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,420
If he says that he received

815
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,790
a new revelation from Almighty,
the 40 days

816
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,790
will probably no longer mean anything.

817
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:25,110
(GUSEONWON)

818
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,860
Sang-mi.

819
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,330
You're doing a good job, right?

820
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,400
Your spiritual wedding
is just around the corner,

821
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,500
so you should clear your mind
of all negative thoughts.

822
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,840
You need a clean slate

823
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,870
in order to accept Almighty
and Spiritual Father

824
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,070
with all of your heart.

825
00:56:58,610 --> 00:56:59,780
Dad.

826
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,280
There's something I want to ask you.

827
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:06,990
Sure, what is it?

828
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,690
After the wedding,

829
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,190
will I have to

830
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,130
sleep with Spiritual Father?

831
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,920
Sang-mi.

832
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,820
That's not what it's about.
That's how he'll baptize you.

833
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,190
Baptism for salvation.

834
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,290
So, you don't need
to worry about anything.

835
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,530
What if I refuse to be baptized?

836
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,600
What will happen to me?

837
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,740
Sang-mi, why are you even
thinking about these things?

838
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,510
No more foolish thoughts.
Just focus on praying instead.

839
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:11,080
My daughter, you can do a good job, right?

840
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,460
So in the end,

841
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,730
I do have to give him my everything.

842
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,870
That's the only way to really end this.

843
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,180
Who are you?

844
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:48,250
You jerks made my mom get all bruised,

845
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,820
saying that you're giving her a prayer.

846
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,620
You guys need to pay for what you did.

847
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,690
Hey, stop--

848
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:03,600
Are you crazy?
Stop that immediately!

849
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,640
Sang-mi.

850
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,210
Get out of here.

851
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,380
Dad.

852
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,120
Don't worry.
Almighty will protect me.

853
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,320
All right.

854
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,460
Let's see if he'll really protect you.

855
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,830
We shall find out.

856
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,880
(SAVE ME)

857
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:58,290
He's here! I caught the rat!

858
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,390
Hey, what are you doing now?

859
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:03,060
He's here! Hurry up!

860
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,100
Have you lost your mind?

861
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,870
-He's over there.
-Get him!

862
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,340
You demons!

863
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,370
-Gosh.
-Guys, get him.
