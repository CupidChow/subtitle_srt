00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,930
(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,930
(FINAL EPISODE)

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,270
Here. I will show you

4
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,710
what is true and what is false.

5
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,630
Apostle Kang.

6
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,600
-No.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

7
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,270
Oh, no.

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,010
Now, take a look.

9
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,789
Do you think this Book of Salvation
which burned to ashes is the truth?

10
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,960
Or am I, whom even the fire
couldn't hurt, the truth?

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,190
-Spiritual Father.
-Goodness.

12
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,400
I shall now stay within you.

13
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,400
I shall declare the truth
through your mouth.

14
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,300
I shall lift your arm

15
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,670
and perform miracles.

16
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,210
And I shall lead you
to the door to salvation.

17
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,479
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

18
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,800
Why did you want to see me?

19
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,130
Where did you hide my mom?

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,770
We didn't hide her.

21
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,540
We just moved her to a better place
for her treatment.

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,480
You satisfy your desire
using a powerless person.

23
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,740
It's just like that cult.

24
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,050
You and my dad are

25
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,480
as crazy as them!

26
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,579
You will realize it after a while.

27
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,550
In this world,

28
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,490
what's real and what's false
are not different.

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,790
So don't try so hard to distinguish
the real from the false.

30
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,260
It will only make your life harder.

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,200
If that's how you live your life,

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,670
I will never live mine the same way.

33
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,600
I told you to give me

34
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,070
the voice recorder
if you want to see your mom.

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
It looked like

36
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,280
your mom misses you a lot.

37
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,340
Your... Your father

38
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,670
He

39
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,880
pushed me.

40
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,510
How could you

41
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,050
How could you do this to me?

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,620
Ji-hui is your assistant!

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,720
It's a misunderstanding.

44
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,220
There seems to be
a big misunderstanding.

45
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,360
Withdraw your candidacy.

46
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,290
What?

47
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,829
If it's really a misunderstanding

48
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,130
just like you said,

49
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,360
withdraw your candidacy.

50
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,970
Tomorrow is the election.

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,340
I want Sang-hwan

52
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,110
to lead an honorable life.

53
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,640
If you don't,

54
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,050
I will give this dash camera footage
to Mr. Cheon, your competitor.

55
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,890
No. Give it to me.

56
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,540
Hi, is this Mr. Cheon's
campaign office?

57
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,040
Yes.

58
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,090
You

59
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
and I

60
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,960
will have a spiritual wedding

61
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,600
and become one.

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,230
I will be at your service.

63
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,340
My savior.

64
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,110
My eternal life.

65
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,270
My

66
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,580
Spiritual Father.

67
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,920
Your mother will be so happy
when she sees you

68
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,790
wearing this wedding dress.

69
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,730
I'm sure Sang-jin will be happy too.

70
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,630
It was that day.

71
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,140
-What?
-That day,

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,070
if I had done everything I could

73
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,070
to stop you,

74
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
would things have turned out differently?

75
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,910
Sang-mi.

76
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,920
Your mother shouldn't be taken
to the hospital.

77
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,550
The only place that can treat her
is Guseonwon.

78
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
Dad.

79
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,400
I pity you now.

80
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,270
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,100
Why would you pity me?

82
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,370
Because

83
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,270
you're not aware of how horrible

84
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,940
this situation is.

85
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,550
Sang-mi.

86
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,020
You shouldn't think like that anymore.

87
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,920
You should be grateful for
how blessed you are.

88
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,960
Just look forward to all
the miraculous things

89
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,260
that will come your way.

90
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,760
Okay?

91
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,360
(FLAME RESISTANT)

92
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,340
-My goodness.
-Unbelievable.

93
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,450
Apostle Kang.

94
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,190
What are you doing here?

95
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,160
Our Almighty said

96
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,070
we can use white lies
as strategies for salvation.

97
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,570
Aren't I right?

98
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,809
It doesn't matter whether you
tell the truth or lie.

99
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,280
Spreading our Almighty's words
is a great thing in itself.

100
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,350
Therefore, our Almighty shall
continue to be happy.

101
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,850
Are you

102
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,360
being swayed right now?

103
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,490
No.

104
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,700
My devotion towards our Almighty
will never get swayed.

105
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,000
Then why

106
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,800
do I see

107
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,840
doubt in your eyes?

108
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,240
It's not because I doubt our Almighty.

109
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,950
It's because I doubt you.

110
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,630
Did you just say that

111
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,430
you're doubting me right now?

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,370
Evil spirits keep spreading in Guseonwon.

113
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,380
I'm doubtful if you're fulfilling
your duty of spreading

114
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,280
our Almighty's

115
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,980
words.

116
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,350
Doubt.

117
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,420
Anxiety.

118
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,020
Fear.

119
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,690
These are all

120
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,790
thoughts of the devil.

121
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,530
I want you to go
to the prayer room right now

122
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,900
and repent.

123
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,940
If I don't contact you
by tomorrow morning

124
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,510
Will you really be able
to disclose all this?

125
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,510
You're basically strangling
your father with your own hands.

126
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,050
You can

127
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,520
disclose everything about my dad.

128
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,870
Is there a patient named
Chae Min-hwa here?

129
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,500
No.

130
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,970
Can you check again?
Her name is Chae Min-hwa.

131
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,270
Please do me a favor.

132
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,250
Hello? Excuse me!

133
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,360
Hey, Man-hui.

134
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,760
Is she not there either?

135
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,960
Okay.

136
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,160
I'll go downtown to look for her.

137
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,070
Call me if you find anything.
Okay, thanks.

138
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,300
Why isn't anyone coming out?

139
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,320
My goodness.

140
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,560
-Are you okay?
-Please...

141
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,270
call

142
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,470
my son.

143
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,300
You want me to call your son?

144
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,170
What happened?

145
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,040
They They brought me here
against my will.

146
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,050
You were forced to come here?

147
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,460
Han Sang...

148
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,460
-Hwan.
-What?

149
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
Han

150
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,570
Han Sang...

151
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,600
-Hwan.
-Hwan.

152
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,470
Is that your son's name?
Han Sang-hwan?

153
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,910
Do you know his phone number?

154
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,290
Salvation.

155
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,860
Eternal life.

156
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,060
Salvation.

157
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,760
Eternal life.

158
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,500
Salvation. Eternal life.

159
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,440
Go to your room.
You should go to sleep.

160
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,580
Our Almighty.
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

161
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,190
Hello?

162
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,490
(Are you Han Sang-hwan?)

163
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,100
Yes, that's me.

164
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,700
Your mother's safe. Don't worry.

165
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,740
Who are you? No. Where is she?

166
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,740
She's at Guseonwon Sanitarium.

167
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,780
Wait. Wait.

168
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,990
(Sang-hwan, it's going to happen
today at dawn.)

169
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,360
(I'm going to do as we planned.
I'll see you at dawn.)

170
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,740
(RESET SETTINGS: YOU WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO RESTORE ANY INFORMATION)

171
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,530
How dare you
try to seduce my daughter?

172
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,470
That's enough, Apostle Im.

173
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,010
This is the only way we can

174
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,570
shake this place upside down.

175
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,140
If he finds out
that I'm Sang-hwan's friend,

176
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,680
he'll lock me up
in the basement storage

177
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,080
with other people.

178
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,850
He said he had a cellphone
inside that water tank.

179
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,620
Why are you doing this to me?

180
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,030
Stop it. It's all over now.

181
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,930
I found it.

182
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,830
It was true.

183
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,030
Take him.

184
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,450
When you met him outside,

185
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,920
what did he say to you?

186
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,160
He said he would save people here

187
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,560
if I pretend not to know him.

188
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,270
Those evil demons.

189
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,040
This is how foolish people
in the outside world are.

190
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,340
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

191
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,500
Sir. Are you okay?

192
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,300
Home... I want to go home.

193
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,140
Excuse me. Please wake up.

194
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,270
We have to get out of here.

195
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,230
Excuse me.

196
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,369
Please don't hurt me.

197
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,740
You shouldn't have been born
in the first place.

198
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,010
Whenever I see you,

199
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,680
I can feel my rage boiling up, you brat.

200
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,050
You should just die!

201
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,020
Dad.

202
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,390
Why Why are you here?

203
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,390
Why? Why!

204
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,360
Don't hit me. Please don't hit me.

205
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,330
Dad.

206
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,640
Is this why you couldn't be there
when Grandma died?

207
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,040
Please don't kill me. Please.

208
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,140
Please don't kill me.

209
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,950
I am

210
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,350
never going to forgive you all.

211
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,660
I'm going to kill all of you myself.

212
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,070
Please don't kill me.

213
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,970
Please don't kill me.

214
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,310
Please...

215
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,250
Hi, Sang-hwan.

216
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,290
(Jeong-hun, do me a favor.)

217
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,320
What is it?

218
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,190
I'm on my way to Guseonwon now.

219
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,620
We're going with Dong-cheol's plan.

220
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,460
If you don't hear from me until
the morning, report it to the police

221
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,630
(and come to Guseonwon.)

222
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,430
No, Sang-hwan. That's not good.
Hold on.

223
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,300
(Don't go there. Let's just...)

224
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,330
Let's talk in person.
Where are you now?

225
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,300
Jeong-hun, Dong-cheol and Sang-mi
are waiting for me now.

226
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,670
-Please do as I said.
(-Sang-hwan, hang on.)

227
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,370
Sang-hwan. Sang-hwan

228
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,890
Guseonwon's secret funds are

229
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,860
inside the vault
in Spiritual Father's office.

230
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,230
The believers will leave
after the morning worship,

231
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,090
so we'll get inside the office then.

232
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,330
Okay?

233
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,100
Almighty.

234
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,600
Guseonwon,
the Boat of Salvation, is

235
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,740
about to sink to the bottom
of the sea now.

236
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,280
Please,

237
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,780
do not let
this Boat of Salvation sink.

238
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,580
Please protect Guseonwon.

239
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,670
Yes, Almighty.

240
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,440
I will do it.

241
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,740
If you

242
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,880
use me as the guardian
of the Boat of Salvation,

243
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,790
I will change everything here
into something new.

244
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,360
I will do that, Almighty.

245
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,690
Mom!

246
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,420
Hey, carry this around you at all times.

247
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,050
-What is this for?
-It has

248
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,920
a location-tracking device in it,

249
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,590
so I can see where you are.

250
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,460
If we end up going with your plan,

251
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,730
I can find you without searching around.

252
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,370
Sang-hwan.

253
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,140
Although I'm here,

254
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,670
I'm not worried at all.

255
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,740
I know you will come for me.

256
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,710
I know you will come

257
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,080
and tell me to stand tall
just like before.

258
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,460
Let's go.

259
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,960
Are you feeling okay?

260
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm fine.

261
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,070
Let's go.

262
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,380
Sang-mi!

263
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,560
There you are, Sang-mi.

264
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,730
Are you ready to do this now?

265
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,270
Yes.

266
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,540
I will save this place

267
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,270
no matter what.

268
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,980
Yes.

269
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,770
There is still enough time.

270
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,540
The fire of our Almighty

271
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,110
will burn away all your sins, and it will

272
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,340
make you become

273
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,780
as light as a feather.

274
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,020
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-We believe it!

275
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,720
Those who wish receive
the fire of our Almighty,

276
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,350
please stand up.

277
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,420
The fire of our Almighty shall be

278
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,630
generously given to everyone here.

279
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,260
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

280
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,260
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

281
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,700
Here is the fire of our Almighty!

282
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,200
Fire!

283
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,410
Fire!

284
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,340
Fire!

285
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Wan-deok.

286
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,760
Let's go.

287
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,660
Dong-cheol.

288
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,430
Dong-cheol!

289
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,570
Dong-cheol!

290
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,170
Sang-hwan.

291
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,070
Sang-hwan! I'm in here!

292
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,810
Sang-hwan!

293
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,810
Sang-hwan! I'm in here!

294
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,690
Sang-hwan! Over here!

295
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,450
Sang-hwan!

296
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,900
Spiritual Mother.

297
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,370
It's time for you to go now.

298
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,780
-Are you okay, Dong-cheol?
-Yes, I'm okay.

299
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,560
I can't believe this.

300
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,440
It's me. It's me, Jeong-hun.

301
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,110
Dong-cheol.
Dong-cheol, are you okay?

302
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,910
Are you okay? My gosh.

303
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,950
What is this place?

304
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,720
I can't believe this.

305
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,190
Those people that you saw are all here.

306
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,620
You should call the police,

307
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,430
and take everyone here to the hospital.

308
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,660
Okay, okay. What about you guys?

309
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,260
We have to go save Sang-mi.

310
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,170
Okay, leave this place to us.
You guys should go.

311
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,470
Okay.

312
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,810
My dad's

313
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,540
in here as well.

314
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,040
I thought he just left home.

315
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,180
But I guess he was brought here.

316
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,490
Please take good care of him.

317
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,320
Okay. Don't worry.

318
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,960
We'll take good care of him.

319
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,690
Don't worry.

320
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,890
Let's go.

321
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,560
Be careful, okay?

322
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,310
You and your daughter

323
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,320
were being controlled by the devil.

324
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,690
That's why these pills never
worked on you.

325
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,290
I never should have brought
your family here.

326
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,160
You were once a mother yourself.

327
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,630
I heard other people talk about you.

328
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,940
I heard that

329
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,370
you also had a daughter like Sang-mi.

330
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,850
Do you want Sang-mi to die
like your daughter did?

331
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,290
If you were once a mother,

332
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,690
please let her go now.

333
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,470
These are your clothes.

334
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,040
You'll be spotted easily
with that patient gown on.

335
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,380
So you should change into something else
and get out of here.

336
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,080
Your daughter

337
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,680
will be sleeping with
Spiritual Father soon.

338
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,330
Okay.

339
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,510
Let's just burn everything
and start all over again.

340
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Then I'll be able to go to paradise

341
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,010
with my daughter

342
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,180
and meet our Almighty.

343
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,930
Come in, Sang-mi.

344
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:47,330
(SPRITUAL FATHER)

345
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,220
Apostle Im.
You may now excuse us and go pray.

346
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,660
Okay. Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

347
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,350
Do not be afraid.

348
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,620
You will

349
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,490
also enjoy this.

350
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,140
You devils!

351
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,810
How dare you come here?

352
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,410
Get lost right now!

353
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,640
Sang-hwan, you should go save her.

354
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,120
Okay. I'll go first.

355
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,620
Where do you think you're going?

356
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,090
Don't refuse

357
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,730
the touch of Almighty.

358
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,440
You devil.

359
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,310
Die!

360
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,180
I can't watch this anymore.

361
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,820
Dong-cheol.

362
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,890
Let's do some workout, shall we?

363
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,660
You go first.

364
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,830
In order to remove your sin,

365
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,840
you have to share

366
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,470
both your body and soul with me.

367
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,870
Only then will I

368
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,150
be able to give you my best
spiritual energy.

369
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,380
This is just the way you used
to violate women.

370
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,450
With your filthy tongue.

371
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,920
Don't try to fight this

372
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,550
if you do not wish to die

373
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,960
at such a young and beautiful age

374
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,460
just like Apostle Kang's daughter, Yu-ra.

375
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,630
How many were there?

376
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,430
How many people have you killed?

377
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,830
We will all

378
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,140
meet again in the paradise.

379
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,900
Everyone including Sang-jin

380
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,640
and Jeong-gu.

381
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,810
Murderer.

382
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,980
You are a murderer!

383
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,910
I'm not too late, am I?

384
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,180
Let's go.

385
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,580
You crazy jerk.

386
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,990
I'm Almighty.

387
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,560
How dare you!

388
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,200
You're a crazy man.

389
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,030
Do you really believe you're Almighty?

390
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,240
You're wrong. You're just a beast.

391
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,580
Sang-mi.

392
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,680
Sang-mi!

393
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,310
Mom!

394
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,220
-Sang-mi!
-Mom.

395
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,650
Are you okay?

396
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,820
I'm sorry I came too late.

397
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,990
No, Mom. I'm okay.

398
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,860
Are you okay?

399
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,700
Did you get evidence?

400
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,070
The truth of that filthy man is
all recorded in here.

401
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,280
I'm going to reveal it now.

402
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,650
Yes. Everything is over now.

403
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,850
Come on. Let's get out of here.

404
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,280
Let's go.

405
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,550
Where do you think you're going?

406
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,190
Sang-mi!

407
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,020
Put that knife down.

408
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,130
You can never get out of here.

409
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,260
Sang-mi. Sang-mi!

410
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,430
-Mom.
-Move. I said, move!

411
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,730
Sang-mi!

412
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,170
Mom, don't come closer.

413
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,140
Do not follow us.

414
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,680
If you do

415
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,610
Sang-mi

416
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,120
Ms. Kim.

417
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,680
I'll take care of her. Go.

418
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,790
Make sure she's okay.

419
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,720
Ms. Kim, are you all right?

420
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,700
Apostle Kang.

421
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,940
Apostle Kang.

422
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,910
What are you

423
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,180
doing right now?

424
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,880
This is the divine message
Almighty sent me.

425
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,650
I heard a clear and distinct voice.

426
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,060
I will burn down every filthy sin
in this place

427
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,060
and start anew.

428
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,630
Have you lost your mind?

429
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,780
I'm Almighty.

430
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,280
How dare you.

431
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,360
Sang-mi.

432
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,730
Almighty will

433
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,670
turn this place into a new one.

434
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,380
What

435
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,250
are you doing?

436
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,480
I will

437
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,920
burn down this filthy place.

438
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,750
Sang-mi.

439
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,890
What?

440
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,990
Are you afraid?

441
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,560
I... I'm sorry.

442
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,100
Forgive me.

443
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,060
No.

444
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,270
You deserve to die.

445
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,240
Die

446
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,670
and fall into the fire pit!

447
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,040
Sang-mi!

448
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,840
Don't do that.

449
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,880
If you do,

450
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,450
you will become a murderer.

451
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,920
No.

452
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,490
I will

453
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,790
end his life myself no matter what.

454
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,530
Didn't you tell me

455
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,930
you would get out of this horrible place

456
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,770
and go back to the world outside?

457
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,240
Let's let him

458
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,500
be judged by the law.

459
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,110
I am...

460
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,210
I am Almighty.

461
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,650
I have eternal life. I am immortal!

462
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,760
It's dangerous.
Let's get out of here.

463
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,900
Help me!

464
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,250
No!

465
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,610
No!

466
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,560
Are you okay?

467
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,130
It's all over now.

468
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,230
Finally,

469
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,970
the time that felt like
a nightmare is over.

470
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,940
You've been strong.

471
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,140
Can you walk?

472
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,180
Yes.

473
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,880
I will

474
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,620
walk out of here by myself proudly.

475
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,730
This place became a total mess
while I was gone.

476
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,880
This is the paradise.

477
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,730
Those evil devils.
I'm going to kill them.

478
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,000
Sang-mi. Spiritual Father.

479
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,300
No. No!

480
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,310
Listen to it and decide for yourself.

481
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,910
My dad...

482
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,650
I mean,

483
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,820
the governor of Muji-gun.
This will tell you everything

484
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,990
about the relationship
between him and the cult leader.

485
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,190
What if it's a complete
waste of time again?

486
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,760
And we'll get in trouble
if Chief finds out about this.

487
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,330
Shut it, you idiot.

488
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,830
Hey, drive faster.

489
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,000
-You devils!
-Go away!

490
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,570
-Go away!
-Leave our premises!

491
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,070
-How dare you set foot here?
-Get out of our premises!

492
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,580
-Go away!
-Get lost!

493
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,610
-Almighty will punish you all.
-Go away!

494
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,520
-All right. Make way, please.
-Go away!

495
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,650
-Move out of our way!
-Get lost!

496
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,490
How dare you set foot
on these grounds?

497
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,350
Spiritual Father is Almighty.

498
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,220
-Go away, you devils!
-Go away!

499
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,760
Why are you guys just standing?
Arrest them!

500
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,790
-Make way!
-Go away!

501
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,130
How dare you!

502
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,600
-My gosh.
-Who is he?

503
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,900
For goodness' sake.

504
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,770
Aren't you believers of Almighty?
Why are you acting like hoodlums?

505
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,910
-Get that jerk.
-Yes, let's go.

506
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,910
-Get him!
-Stop right there!

507
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,250
-Stop!
-Go away!

508
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,330
No.

509
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,500
My daughter must become Spiritual Mother.

510
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,800
She must. I ought to make her
become Spiritual Mother.

511
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,180
-What about Sang-mi?
-She'll be okay.

512
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,320
Gosh, you rat. Dong-cheol.

513
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,950
My life has become a mess
because of you guys.

514
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,090
You must be ready
for the consequences.

515
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,090
What should we do?

516
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,530
Please don't worry.

517
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,990
Stay right behind me, okay?

518
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,430
Wan-deok.

519
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,150
Dong-cheol!

520
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,390
You rats ruined everything.

521
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,530
Because of you punks.

522
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:11,400
You jerks. It's all your fault.

523
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,270
Hey, Mr. Curly Hair.

524
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,400
Mr. Gatekeeper.

525
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,240
Mom.

526
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,380
I told you to never trust anybody.

527
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,710
You guys are surely friends.
You're like two peas in a pod.

528
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,620
Hey, aren't you embarrassed that
you're fighting with kids?

529
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,550
How about a showdown with me?

530
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,350
Mr. Curly Hair.

531
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,370
-You piece of...
-Jerk!

532
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,550
You little...

533
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,960
Jerk! You piece of...

534
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:18,160
You scum. Get a taste of this, jerk!

535
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,670
You rats got me into this mess!

536
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,510
I warned you not to act up,
you scumbag.

537
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,140
Gosh, those crazy pagans.

538
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,910
They sure are persistent.

539
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,880
Bring it on.

540
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,270
Is it you, Apostle Jo?

541
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,080
Oh, look who's here.

542
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,550
Sergeant Woo, it's you.

543
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,580
What happened to you?
What are you doing here?

544
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,520
I must say,

545
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,090
I think Almighty loves me very much.

546
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,530
Who would've thought
I would run into you here?

547
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,730
Please Help me.
Hurry, let's get out of here.

548
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,300
I asked you what you're doing here.

549
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:08,370
I hope you're not trying to flee alone.

550
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,610
What are you doing now?

551
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,130
You stay out.
I'll take care of this.

552
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,670
Wait.

553
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,020
Do you think

554
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,620
that nothing will happen
to you if I get arrested?

555
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,590
You'll be doomed too. You got that?

556
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,070
Those who have sinned must be punished.

557
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,310
Officer Choe.

558
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,310
Arrest both of us.

559
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,020
-Sorry?
-Didn't you hear me? Arrest us!

560
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,120
Come on.

561
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,200
No.

562
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,510
Apostle Kang.

563
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,620
A new chapter has begun.

564
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,780
Sorry?

565
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,390
This was what Almighty wanted.

566
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,400
Yes, Almighty.

567
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,830
I'll rise again

568
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:16,100
and spread your word
to the entire world.

569
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,380
Will we really be able
to rise again?

570
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,380
Of course.

571
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,480
-Come on!
-Let go of us!

572
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,690
Dong-cheol.

573
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,830
Take care of the rest for me.
I need to find my mom.

574
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,500
All right. I know that you'll find her,
Sang-hwan.

575
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,270
Just a second.

576
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,040
Is your name Han Sang-hwan?

577
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:54,210
Yes.

578
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,910
Han

579
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,810
-Sang Hwan.
-Sang?

580
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:04,380
Is your mother ill by any chance?

581
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:10,090
Are you the one who called me?

582
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,290
Yes, it was me.
I'll show you where your mom is.

583
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,530
-I'll get going.
-All right. I'll see you later.

584
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,340
Sang-hwan.

585
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,380
Thanks.

586
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,880
Had you not heard what I said

587
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,290
in the van that day, I would have
fallen apart a long time ago.

588
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,660
Save me.

589
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,800
What a surprise.
I didn't think you'd ever thank me.

590
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,340
See you later.

591
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,060
-Mom.
-Yes?

592
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,030
If an omnipotent being

593
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,260
really exists up there,

594
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,870
he'll be sure to punish them, right?

595
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,200
Of course.

596
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,240
He will definitely answer our prayers.

597
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,080
(In mountains in Muji-gun,
North Gyeongsang Province,)

598
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:45,320
(many dead bodies have been found,
and the news has left many in shock.)

599
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,120
(They're speculated to have been
buried by a religious organization,)

600
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:52,260
(and wounds that could have been
caused by assault have been found,)

601
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,560
(so it looks like the police
will carry out autopsies.)

602
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,500
My father, Governor Han Yong-min,

603
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,600
colluded with a religious cult

604
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,670
and tried to build a sanitarium

605
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,210
in order to obtain
and launder illegal funds.

606
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,510
Also, in order to conceal
his corrupt deeds,

607
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,110
on June 29, 2016,

608
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,380
he pushed my mother,

609
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,290
Chae Min-hwa, down a mountain hill

610
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,490
in an attempt to kill her.

611
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,360
I would like to take this chance
to report my father,

612
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,830
Governor Han Yong-min,

613
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,270
-to the police.
-How do you feel now?

614
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,640
Don't worry.

615
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,470
Things will quiet down very soon.

616
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,240
You should hire lawyers first
so that we can

617
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:45,840
This must be the end.

618
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,320
I wanted to see how high you can go up,

619
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,060
but I ended up seeing you
fall hard instead.

620
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,060
Ji-hui.

621
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,140
You should get going.

622
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,850
Please come with us, Mr. Han.

623
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:48,810
There he is! He's coming!

624
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,540
-There he is.
-He's here.

625
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,680
He's here.

626
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,810
Sir, do you admit that you attempted
to murder your wife?

627
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,950
Do you admit that you colluded
with a religious cult?

628
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,290
A reporter who was working
on a story about them was murdered.

629
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,750
Please say a few words.

630
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,590
I will answer all questions
in detail in court.

631
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,230
-How do you feel now?
-Say a few words.

632
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,230
-Sir, please say a few words.
-Sir!

633
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,240
Hello, Senator Choe.

634
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,340
It's me, Lee Ji-hui.

635
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,220
How have you been?

636
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,890
I'm thinking of moving back
to Yeouido.

637
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,120
If you have some time--

638
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,860
Ms. Lee, where do you think you're going?

639
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:42,960
Sorry?

640
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,430
You need to be interviewed as a witness.

641
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,470
You were in the same boat
with Mr. Han, you know.

642
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:52,070
Sir, I'll call you back in a bit.

643
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,910
Go on. I'll follow you.

644
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,750
-There he is.
-It must be him.

645
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,160
Sir, how do you feel now?

646
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,860
Please say a few words.

647
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,030
-Please say a few words!
-Are the allegations true?

648
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,330
Sir!

649
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,070
-We love you
-We love you

650
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,600
-Almighty
-Almighty

651
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,870
-Spiritual Father gives us joy
-Spiritual Father gives us joy

652
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,610
Do you really believe that
your leader is still alive?

653
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,110
How dare you!

654
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,950
-I saw it with my own two eyes.
-That's right.

655
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:37,220
Spiritual Father ascended
to the sky in a big whiff of smoke.

656
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,520
He even waved his hand at me like this.

657
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,250
I know that he'll be resurrected.

658
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,020
Totally. Look at this. This is

659
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:45,860
his autograph.

660
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,130
Salvation and immortal life.

661
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,030
He'll be resurrected and return to us!

662
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,130
That's right!

663
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,300
You devils. If you look down on us,

664
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,070
three generations of your family
will end up in the fiery pit!

665
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,240
His grace and kindness saved us.

666
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,410
-He never duped us!
-Exactly!

667
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,610
She's absolutely right.

668
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,210
-Spiritual Father gives me joy
-Spiritual Father gives me joy

669
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,880
-Spiritual Father gives me joy
-Spiritual Father gives me joy

670
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,480
-Spiritual Father gives me joy
-Spiritual Father gives me joy

671
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,090
-I love you, Almighty
-I love you, Almighty

672
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,290
All of you survived

673
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,290
the Day of Judgment because

674
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:23,730
you were chosen by Almighty.

675
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,700
Do you all believe it?

676
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,500
-We believe it.
-We believe it.

677
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
"Ask,"

678
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,900
"and you shall receive."

679
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,270
"Seek,"

680
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,070
"and you shall find the answer."

681
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,440
"Knock,"

682
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,340
"and the door will open."

683
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,950
All those who ask shall receive,

684
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,050
all those who seek
will find the answer,

685
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:44,550
and the door will open
for all those who knock.

686
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,490
So far, we've been

687
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,160
trying to find a way to make
the Boat of Salvation float again

688
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,060
by asking and praying to Almighty
with all of our hearts

689
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,190
to find the answer.

690
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,330
And finally, Almighty

691
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,570
spoke clearly to me.

692
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,400
He told me

693
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,840
that this place will become
Guseonwon's new sanctuary.

694
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,640
Do you all believe it?

695
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,680
-We believe it, Spiritual Mother!
-We believe it, Spiritual Mother!

696
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,520
(IM SANG-JIN,
AUGUST 2, 1998 - MARCH 10, 2014)

697
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,680
Sang-jin.

698
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,390
I'll never become weak like that again.

699
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,090
Sang-mi and I will try to live
our lives to the fullest,

700
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:33,830
so you should rest in peace now.

701
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,640
Sang-jin.

702
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:45,410
Mom and I want to be happy now

703
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,210
so that

704
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,880
you don't have to worry about us

705
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,620
and smile in the real paradise.

706
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:10,840
Bye, My lovely son.

707
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,100
Have you eaten yet?

708
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,870
What about you?

709
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,500
Not yet.

710
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,210
Do you want to eat jjajangmyeon?

711
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:54,850
Sure.

712
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:59,280
My dad and I will challenge
ourselves and see if we can do this.

713
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:00,290
In how many minutes?

714
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,690
All right. If we finish this
in five minutes, we don't have to pay.

715
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,290
-Do you think you can do it?
-Yes, sure.

716
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,290
-Will you be okay?
-Of course.

717
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,130
Then before we pick up
our chopsticks,

718
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,900
we should drink this
to protect our stomachs.

719
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,630
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

720
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,370
All right, here we go.

721
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,200
Start!

722
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,670
Gosh, it's so spicy!

723
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,150
Look at this idiot. I'm out.

724
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,620
My mouth is on fire!

725
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:43,860
Goodness, why is this beer so bland?

726
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,300
Here.

727
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,270
Goodness, cut it out.

728
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,570
Come on.

729
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,740
-Me?
-Yes.

730
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,280
Make sure you chew well.

731
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:07,650
My gosh, what on earth
has gotten into you two?

732
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,720
Pil-su, this guy can be
so sweet like this.

733
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:11,860
Aren't I right?

734
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,360
Okay, I heard you.

735
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,190
Eat up.

736
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,100
Jun-gu, you should try this too.

737
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,070
-Drink up, guys.
-You too, Jun-gu.

738
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,810
-Let's do this.
-All right, cheers.

739
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,040
Cheers.

740
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,910
-I'll see you all soon.
-All right.

741
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,380
Sang-hwan, what you need in order
to thrive here isn't your brain

742
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,590
but your guts. You know that, right?

743
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,620
Is that right?

744
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,990
Is that why you got fired
from the courier service?

745
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,730
I hope you're not proud of that.
You need to use your brain.

746
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,330
You little...

747
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,260
Sang-hwan, Sang-hwan.

748
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:55,700
Gosh, my eyes are welling up with tears.

749
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:58,600
When he was a toddler,
I changed his diapers

750
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:00,040
and fed him.

751
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,470
-I even carried him around--
-Isn't your enlistment next week?

752
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,810
Shut it! I want to pause time.

753
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,380
Time will keep flowing.

754
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,180
Make sure you don't skip meals, okay?

755
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,450
Don't you worry.

756
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,750
You should try to eat less, okay?

757
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,590
I should go in now. Here, guys.

758
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,230
Good luck.

759
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,660
See you soon.

760
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:26,870
I'll follow you soon.

761
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:28,970
I'll see you guys soon.

762
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,400
Has everything been well?

763
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,070
You'll visit us too, right?

764
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:10,610
We're all friends, you know.

765
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,380
Yes.

766
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,190
(People ask me)

767
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,790
(how I was able to hold out
at a place like that.)

768
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:32,360
(The hope that I'll be able
to get out of there one day.)

769
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,340
(The hope that the real omnipotent
being must be watching over us.)

770
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,940
(The hope that someone will answer)

771
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,110
(upon hearing my desperate cry.)

772
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:48,110
(Such hopes are
what got me through those days.)

773
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:50,980
(I believe)

774
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,490
(that such hopes still exist
in this world.)

775
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:45,200
(SAVE ME)

776
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,340
Almighty is the king
and the creator of the paradise.

777
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,310
You must believe Almighty!

778
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,740
The day of judgment is coming.

779
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:55,780
All of us must pray and repent our sins.

780
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:59,250
This world is filled with evil souls.

781
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,350
You must believe Almighty.

782
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:04,320
Spiritual Father is still alive.

783
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,320
Pray and repent your sins.

784
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:09,360
The day of judgment
is just around the corner.

785
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:11,800
The day of salvation is near.

786
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:14,100
I'm certain that Spiritual Father

787
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,940
will return to us!
