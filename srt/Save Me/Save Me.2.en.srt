There's something strange
about those people.

It's just because you're not familiar

is spent on your meat.

However, I won't be putting
the mint candy in the soda.

54
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,270
I'll put them into my mouth first.
I've already peeled many of them.

55
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,640
I'll dump all of them into my mouth
and drink the soda in one minute.

I don't want to eat. I'm full.

58
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,780
All right. Then,

59
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,280
What? I should just eat dinner
because it's an impossible mission?

60

You go eat your dinner, okay?

I never give up.

I'll eat them all.

63

of mint candy I have.

64

to fill me up, okay?

70
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,410
All right. I'll open the bottle
of soda now. Here we go.

71
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,750
Okay, the bottle is now open.

72
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,320

about it at all.

donated his house to us

89

so it worked out perfectly.

-Honey, where should I put this?

105
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,870
Oh, that? It should go
in the master bedroom.

106

All right, I'll leave it
in the master bedroom.

-If that's the case,

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,130
Gosh, that girl from Seoul
is so provoking.

161
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,290
Is she looking down on us
because we're from Muji?

162
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,460
It's not because she was
looking down on you.

163
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,870
It's because you have no manners.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,670
Whatever. Why did you follow me here?

165
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,540
The women's bathroom is full.

166
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,140
Hey.

167
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,010
You should sincerely apologize

168
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,010
bumping into me.

169
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,410
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,620
What's this?
"Salvation" and "Eternal life"?

171
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,120
Do you go to church?

172
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,050
No, I'm only here to help.

173
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,160
What? It sounds like he came from Seoul.

174
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,560
-Are you from Seoul?
-Yes.

175
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,900
He sounds like a girl.

176
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,530
Move over.

177
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,830
-Please don't do this.
-Don't move.

178
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,000
-Let me see.
-Move.

179
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,640
-Let's see.
-Don't do this.

180
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,340
-Don't move.
-Are you embarrassed

181
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,440
because of her?

182
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,050
I can already imagine what's inside.

183
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,650
Go and lock the door.

184
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,250
Keep going.

185
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,450
Move your hand. Come on.

186
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,890
Let me see.

187
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,760
Stop it. Please stop.

188
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,470
Sang-jin.

189
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,010
Are you okay?

190
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,670
What?

191
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,180
Yes, I'm okay.

192
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,410
My gosh, Sang-jin.

193
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,580
You must've been tired.

194
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,890
My goodness, get in.

195
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,820
Sang-mi.

196
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
Do you feel sick?

197
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,540
No, I'm fine.

198
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,770
I heard that twins are able
to understand each other

199
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,010
even without having to talk
to one another.

200
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,210
Is it really true that
you guys can

201
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,850
communicate telepathically?

202
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,350
I can sometimes feel how he's doing
even when he doesn't say anything.

203
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,320
I envy you, Sang-jin.

204
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,560
You have such a pretty sister.

205
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,860
Sang-jin.

206
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Yes?

207
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,670
Drink slowly.

208
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,640
We have to go to a worship service.

209
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,470
I'm sorry that we couldn't
buy you dinner.

210
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,440
No, it's okay. Bye.

211
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,410
There's a really famous
Korean beef restaurant in Muji.

212
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,120
It tastes amazing.

213
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,820
Let's go eat there next time.

214
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,850
You both like meat, right?

215
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,120
Yes, we do. See you next time.

216
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,060
You did great today.
I hope you take some rest.

217
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,400
Okay.

218
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Let's go.

219
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,700
Okay.

220
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,540
Let's eat together next time.

221
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,880
-Sang-jin.
-What?

222
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,450
Something happened earlier, right?

223
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,650
No, nothing happened.

224
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,250
Stop lying to me.

225
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,990
Sang-mi.

226
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,530
Mom and Dad are going through
a lot right now.

227
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,700
So please don't say anything to them.

228
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,000
Please.

229
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay.

230
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,450
(LAUNDRY ROOM)

231
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,990
Let's clean your legs too.

232
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,960
My gosh.

233
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,760
You pooped, sir.

234
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,870
Good job.

235
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,970
Okay, let's take off your underwear.

236
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,410
Here we go.

237
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,180
Take it off slowly.
Please raise your bottom.

238
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
There.

239
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,910
My gosh.

240
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,290
My goodness, Spiritual Father.

241
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,150
You're working again.
Stop it already.

242
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,260
No, it's okay. I'm almost done.

243
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,690
My goodness.

244
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,090
Why are you cleaning that
dirty underwear with your hands?

245
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,530
The laundry machine is right here.

246
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,530
What do you mean?
It's not dirty at all.

247
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,800
You already pray for everyone
until late at night.

248
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,170
We're just worried that

249
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,570
you might lose your health
by working so hard.

250
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,840
Then I should get a massage

251
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,010
from you.

252
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,520
How did you know that
I'm good at giving massages?

253
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,850
Give that to me.

254
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,750
I took care of my mother-in-law
until she was 80 years old.

255
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,760
So I'm a master at cleaning
dirty underwear.

256
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,760
My gosh, you don't need to take over.

257
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,630
Ju-hyeon.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,070
-Wait.
-Hurry up.

259
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,870
It's mine.

260
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,510
Sit down.

261
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,280
Dong-cheol. Dong-cheol.

262
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,950
Isn't this fate?

263
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,550
Everyone, be quiet.

264
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,960
She'll feel awkward
since she's from Seoul,

265
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,290
so I want all of you to be friendly
towards her. Okay?

266
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,460
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

267
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,930
Say something to your friends.

268
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,500
My name is Im Sang-mi.

269
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,000
-My gosh.
-Listen to her accent.

270
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,400
Haven't you ever heard
a Seoul accent before?

271
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,069
Stop acting like
you're from the countryside.

272
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,210
Sang-hwan.

273
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,480
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,840
Do you see the empty seat
next to him?

275
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,750
That's your seat.
You can go sit there.

276
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,280
-My gosh.
-I'm so envious.

277
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,080
-You're so lucky.
-I can't believe this.

278
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,720
-Sang-hwan.
-Yes?

279
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,490
-You can sit back down.
-Okay, ma'am.

280
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,830
Where did we finish off yesterday?

281
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,130
(Have you been doing well?)

282
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,830
Let's eat together, my friend.

283
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,460
It won't taste good like this.

284
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,060
Here. It'll taste better
if you mix everything like this.

285
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,430
Here's the finale.

286
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,240
Now, this is what you call dog food.

287
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,440
Hurry up and eat.

288
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,780
Well, I--

289
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,550
Hurry up and eat your lunch.

290
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,750
Hey!

291
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,860
Eat.

292
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,330
Hey, I said eat your lunch!

293
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,590
Hey!

294
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,360
What was that?

295
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,400
-Apologize to him.
-Who are you?

296
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,630
Are you his girlfriend or what?

297
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,770
If you don't apologize this instant,
I'll report you to the police.

298
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,670
Oh, she must be his sister.

299
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,640
-Sister?
-I heard he has a twin sister.

300
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,210
It must be her.

301
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,410
Hey, is she your sister?

302
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,750
Is that so? Then

303
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,490
give me money
to get this dry-cleaned first.

304
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,960
You guys harassed him first.

305
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,090
Do you have proof?

306
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,260
Guys, if any of you

307
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,200
saw me harassing this idiot,
come forward. Now!

308
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,370
I said come forward now!

309
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,470
Say something. All of you saw it!

310
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,900
This girl is funny.

311
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,470
Hey.

312
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,710
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

313
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,080
I'll be nice to you.

314
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,380
-Did you see that?
-Is she out of her mind?

315
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,880
Hey, have you lost your mind?

316
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,190
Hey, are you crazy?

317
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,290
Hey!

318
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,630
You're embarrassing all of us.

319
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,500
If you come any closer,
I'll beat up all of you to a pulp.

320
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,370
Hey, do you know whom
you're dealing with here?

321
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,740
Are you both insane or what?

322
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,070
I have the strongest punch
in the entire school.

323
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,840
-Oh, is that so?
-You do?

324
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,940
What kind of punch? Fruit punch?

325
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,380
-Rum punch?
-Slush punch?

326
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,410
-My gosh.
-Aren't I so witty?

327
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,790
Are you guys confident?

328
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,120
Then shall we have a showdown?

Dong-seok, let's just go.

331
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,500
What are you talking about?
I'll teach them a serious lesson.

332
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,930
It's not that.
He's Han Sang-hwan.

333
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,200
Who's Han Sang-hwan?

334
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,300
What are you whispering
to each other?

335
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,510
That bell saved your lives today.

336
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,280
I'll see you both soon.
You got that?

337
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,710
Let go, you idiot.

338
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,550
-I said, let go.
-All right, see you around.

339
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,920
-What's his problem?
-Who knows?

340
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,420
-Are you guys all right?
-Yes.

341
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,690
Those jerks will bother you guys again.
You should tell your teacher.

342
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,660
Can't you hear me? Those jerks--

343
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,030
Thanks for your help today,
but we'll figure out what to do.

344
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,780
-Watch me, okay?
-Just shoot it.

345
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,740
-Wait. Hold on a second.
-Pass me the ball.

346
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,110
Here you go.

347
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,950
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

348
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,020
I heard you guys had a fight
with that bully during lunch break.

349
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,760
We didn't fight. He ran away as
soon as he heard Sang-hwan's name.

350
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
That's correct.

351
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,630
Nice. You sure are the son
of the future governor.

352
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,660
He's definitely not like us
lowborn people. You lowlife.

353
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
You slave.

-Lowlife Choe Man-hui.
-Slave Woo Jeong-hun.

355
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,600
-Do you want a showdown?
-At the internet cafe?

356
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,310
You read my mind.
This guy can really pick up hints.

357
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can join you guys today.

358
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,450
-Bye.
-Hey, wait.

359
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,750
We can't split into teams
of two without you.

360
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,520

-Okay, bye.
-Sorry. See you.

362

I'll be off too.

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,530
Is something up?

364
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,800
It's your mom's birthday, right?

365
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,170
Hey, pull those shoulders back, okay?

366
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,040
You idiot. Fix your shoulders first.

367
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,880
-Pull back your shoulders, jerk.
-Gosh.

368
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,340
I told you to fix yours first.

I was in the area for my volunteer work.

372
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,800
I stopped by just in case
and saw you two walking out.

373
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,510
Oh, right. Apostle Kang said
she has to give you guys something.

374
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,780
You have time
to stop by Guseonwon, right?

375
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,240
Pardon me?

waiting for you.

I'm not sure if I can accept this.

383

I'll call my dad
and ask him if it's okay to--

384
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,910
Are you really going to be like this?

385
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,510
-Sorry?
-You should know how to accept

386
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,520
a gesture of sincere kindness.

387
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,460
Oh, I apologize if I hurt your feelings.

388
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I wasn't sure
because this looks expensive.

389
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,530
You didn't hurt my feelings.

390
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Our faith for Almighty makes us
a community that shares everything.

391

I'd love it if you could let
your guard down and accept us now.

pray for their hardships.

429

Did you make a lot of new friends?

It was only our first day.

There's no need to rush.

It... It was nice.

443
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,060
That's good to hear.
I noticed that

444
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,400
people in this town are so nice.

445
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,440
They're so naive and honest.

No, I just don't have an appetite.

449
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,610
But you should still finish
your dinner, Sang-jin.

450
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,350
He's probably tired from having
to adjust to the new environment.

Sang-mi, you should take
good care of Sang-jin.

00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,530
You should act as his guardian
at school.

Okay?

456
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
No, no.

Sir, it's time for you to go now.

462
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,210
Can you think of another
expression than saying,

463
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,010
"I'll do my best to protect you"?

464
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,510
It just sounds too common.
There's nothing special about this.

465
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,350
"I'll protect you like a father."
How does that sound?

466
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
What?

467
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,530
Sang-hwan, wait a moment.

00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,260
-We don't have much time.
-Just a second.

Come here, you punk.

470

I'm going to be late for school.

471
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,570
Your mom told you to always wear
your necktie properly

regardless of how busy you may be.

473
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,510
Sang-hwan, I know you're already
aware of this,

474
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,980
but I'm going to make sure to become
the governor again,

475
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,150
and I'm going to make
your mom get better.

476
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,190
So please stay out
of trouble until then.

477
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,560
You can do me that much, right?

478
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,860
I'm sorry.

479
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,630
You'll be late for school.

480
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,130
You should be the one to hurry up.

481
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,260
Okay.

482
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,230
Bye.

483
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,770
You should go now.

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:05,770
Okay.

485
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,170
"Like a father".

486
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,739
Let's go with that one.

487
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,820
Confucius thought the root cause
of our world's chaos

488
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:18,690
was the moral corruption
among humans.

489
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,920
To overcome this,
this is what he said.

490
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,820
He emphasized that we should
become benevolent.

491
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:26,690
Then let's talk about the core
meaning of our existence.

492
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,429
Listen up.

493
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,300
I heard that some of you frequently go to

494
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,969
billiard rooms and pubs these days.

495
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,310
You know what will happen
if any of you get caught by me, right?

496
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,580
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

497
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,949
The ones in charge of cleaning today
are Sang-hwan and Dong-cheol.

498
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,380
I want you guys to clean
the classroom neatly

499
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,880
and come to me for a checkup
before you go home.

500
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
-Okay, ma'am.
-Okay, ma'am.

501
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,090
See you guys.

502
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,630
Hey.

503
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

504
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,380
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

505
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,410
I wish you all the best.

506
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,850
Please help me, sir.

507
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,890
Come on. Come on.

508
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,720
Forget it. You can play by yourself.

509
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,660
My gosh, what's taking them so long?

510
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,170
Isn't she that girl from Seoul?
She is.

511
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,100
-Is she waiting for someone?
-Watch out.

512
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,200
For what?

513
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,740
Hey!

514
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,910
You could've warned me.

515
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,740
I told you to watch out.

516
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,110
Really?

517
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,080
Shouldn't we tell the teacher?

518
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,720
About what? That guy from Seoul?

519
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,220
-Yes.
-Forget it.

520
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,820
Stay out of other people's business.

521
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Excuse me.

522
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,910
Why? Do you think someone's going to
come to help you?

523
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Hey.

524
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,820
Let's hear you pray.

525
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,260
Get over here.

526
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,030
Are you okay?

527
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,670
Please help me.

528
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,070
Please help my brother.

529
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,110
What's wrong?

530
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,810
I think those guys took him
to the rooftop.

531
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,910
-What?
-It must be them.

532
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,880
Sang-hwan, aren't you going to go?

533
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,550
I'm going to make sure to become
the governor again,

534
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,550
and I'm going to make
your mom get better.

535
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,620
So please stay out of trouble until then.

536
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,730
You can do me that much, right?

537
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,740
You said you'll take care of it
on your own.

538
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,040
Dong-cheol, let's go play basketball.

539
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,580
Hey, what's wrong with you?

540
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,150
Don't ask us for help.
Go and tell the teachers.

541
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,210
Okay?

542
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,490
Sang-hwan, are you really not
going to help her?

543
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,060
Stay out of her business.
We're not the police.

544
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Is it because of

545
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,560
your dad?

546
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,900
-Don't say that.
-Hey.

547
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,070
Did he tell you to be careful
because of his election?

548
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,670
I told you not to say that.

549
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,970
Do you

550
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,040
like her?

551
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,750
Then you can go by yourself.

552
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,410
Take your hand off me.

553
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,090
Sang-jin.

554
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,300
Hey, keep doing what you were
going to do.

555
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,300
Come on.
You already showed it to us last time.

556
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,900
What are you embarrassed of,
you jerk?

557
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,340
He peed his pants.

558
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,440
Take your pants off, you punk.

559
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,240
Just leave.

560
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,580
Sang-jin, don't do it.

561
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,450
Put your clothes back on.

562
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,960
I didn't say he can.

563
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,730
-Stop it already!
-Should I ask your brother?

564
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,960
What do you say?
Do you want me to show her the picture?

565
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,370
Or do you want to play with us?

566
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,070
You should just leave.

567
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,310
Did you hear that?

568
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,080
Your brother is telling you to leave.

569
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,680
I beg you.

570
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Please let my brother go.

571
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,090
That's not how you beg somebody.

572
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,490
Nothing is free in this world.

573
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,090
Take off your clothes instead.

574
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,470
Sang-hwan.

575
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,770
Where is Dong-cheol?

576
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,940
Take it off.

577
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,220
Gosh, my heart is about to burst.

578
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Hey. Listen to me carefully.

579
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,530
You're not humans.
You're just filthy scum.

580
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,900
What did you just say?

581
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,730
Hey.

582
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,140
You still don't know your place.

583
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,940
You're a nobody
if you're not with Han Sang-hwan.

584
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,710
Know your place, you idiot.

585
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,280
I'm on class duty today.

586
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,690
What are you gabbling about?

587
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,990
I'm in charge of cleaning up the trash.

588
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,560
What are you waiting for?

589
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,930
Bring it on.

590
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,880
You punk.

591
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,050
Get up.

592
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
Sang-jin.

593
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,160
Stop!

594
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,310
Come on.

595
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm going left, right.
Left, right, left right.

596
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,250
-Down, down.
-I'll block the shot.

597
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,120
-Here we go.
-Jump.

598
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,250
What is it? You can't push
through my defense? Is that it?

599
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,050
Sang-hwan.

600
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,700
Hey, where are you going?

601
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,530
Let go of me!

602
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,570
Sang-jin!

603
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,750
Sang-jin.

604
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,060
Please don't do that.

605
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,930
-I shouldn't have been born.
-Don't say that.

606
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,700
That dimwit is putting on a big show.

607
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,730
This place is the same too.

608
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,410
-I can't escape it anyway.
-That's not true.

609
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,070
I can change that.

610
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,480
I'll help you.

611
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,680
The arms of the Almighty

612
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,020
are always open to anyone.

613
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,730
I'm sorry, Sang-mi.

614
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,100
I don't think my prayers are
going to be answered.

615
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,140
What are you talking about?

616
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,080
No!

617
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,260
No.

618
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,780
Dong-cheol!

619
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,330
Save me.

620
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,940
POLICE

621
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,810
Get off.

622
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,210
I said, get off.

623
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,020
Get off of me! I didn't do anything.

624
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,790
That jerk kicked me first.
It's all his fault.

625
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,560
That's enough. We'll talk inside.

626
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
Get inside.

627
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,690
Dong-cheol!

628
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,100
Dad. Dong-cheol didn't do
anything wrong.

629
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,170
You brat. I've been a policeman
since before you were even born.

630
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,530
I can easily tell.

631
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,870
It's true. Dong-cheol went up
to the rooftop to help Sang-mi.

632
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,370
Sang-hwan.
We'll find out the details

633
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,410
as we investigate.

634
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,120
What on earth is going on?

635
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,020
Hello?

636
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,260
Yes, this is he.

637
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,130
What?

638
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,910
Wait, what are you doing?

639
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,810
Those are my shoes.

640
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,890
No. No, it can't be true!

641
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,120
Are you insane?

642
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:05,960
What is she...

643
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,190
-Please let me carry it.
-Gosh.

644
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,060
Please make yourself at home.

645
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,270
The red light has gone off.

646
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,800
Hey, hurry up and come.

647
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,680
(-Spiritual Father gives us joy
-Spiritual Father gives us joy)

648
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,650

00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:46,650
-Yes!

670
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,630
Do you all believe it?

00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,400
-Yes, we believe it!
-Yes, we believe it!

(Mom.)

679
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,770
Sang-jin.

680
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,720
Sang-jin.

681
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,920
Sang-jin.

682
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,530
Sang-jin.

683
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,600
When I was

684
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,970
praying early this morning,

685
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,740
Almighty appeared before me

686
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,140
and said this to me in a clear voice.

687
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,310
"My son,"

688
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,920
"you must spread
the secret of salvation"

689
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:28,250
"and save the poor souls
that are"

690
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,030
"floundering in pain
and agony even at this minute."

691
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,260
"That is why"

692
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,900
"I sent you to Muji-gun."

693
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,060
What's the matter?

694
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,930
I don't know where mom is.

695
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
What?

696
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,680
Ma'am.

697
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,690
Where do you think demons reside?

698
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:42,100
Demons don't look like scary monsters.

699
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,560
Then what do they look like?
Demons don't look like scary monsters.

700
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,230
Then what do they look like?

701
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,000
They're around you.

702
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,940
They put on kind-looking faces
and approach you.

703
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,170
They come to you
as your friends, husband,

704
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,980
and children.
They try to seduce you

705
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,310
and shake up your faith.

706
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,350
My goodness.
Then what should I do?

707
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,260
Believe in Almighty.

708
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,500
And

709
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,800
believe in me.

710
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,140
Believe in Almighty and me.

711
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,180
That's all you have to do.

712
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,280
I do. I believe in you.

713
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,180
I believe in both Almighty and you.

714
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,780
I'm a firm believer.

715
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:41,890
Sang-jin.

716
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,360
Sang-jin, where are you going?
Mom is here.

717
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,530
Sang-jin.

718
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,870
Sang-jin, come here!

719
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,480
To reach the paradise
Almighty has created for us,

720
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,580
we must

721
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,110
get on the Boat of Salvation.

722
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,220
However, do you think
that anyone can be on that boat?

723
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,420
Can everybody pay their way
into the Boat of Salvation?

724
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,390
-No.
-Of course not.

725
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:23,130
Evil is ruling the world now.

726
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,330
Big buildings are collapsing,

727
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,270
airplanes are crashing,
and earthquakes are happening.

728
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,300
It's all because of the evil energy.

729
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:32,810
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

730
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,770
The only way

731
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,710
we can be saved
from this evil world

732
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,550
is through our belief in Almighty.
Do you all believe it?

733
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,780
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

734
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,520
-Honey.
-Mom.

735
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,990
Honey. Honey.

736
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,260
Excuse me. Have you seen
my mom by any chance?

737
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,720
-Pardon me?
-Well...

738
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,630
She's about this tall.

739
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,630
She's in her 40s,
and she's wearing slippers.

740
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,160
No, I haven't seen her.

741
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,810
-Ma'am, please come down.
-Sang-jin.

742
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,480
It's dangerous!

743
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,550
Sang-jin.

744
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,790
Come to Mom.
Where are you going?

745
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,560
Ma'am, please come down first.

746
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,930
Sang-jin.

747
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,830
-Mom!
-Honey!

748
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,570
Sang-jin is...

749
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,300
He keeps running away from me.

750
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,940
It's dangerous up there.
Get back down, okay?

751
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,570
Sang-jin.

752
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,280
Don't leave me.

753
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:45,580
Sang-jin.

754
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,310
Sang-jin, get back here!

755
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,450
Sang-jin, come here.

756
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,720
Sang-jin, please come to me.

757
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,120
-Sang-jin, please...
-Mom!

758
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,260
Mom! Mom.

759
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,540
No...

760
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,740
Mom!

761
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,110
Honey, honey!

762
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,660
Almighty said this to me
loud and clear.

763
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:37,760
"I will be your savior!"

764
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,770
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

765
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:43,740
"I will become your truth."

766

-We believe it!

767

"I will be your father."

768
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,080
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

769
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,150
Spiritual Father, I believe in you.

770
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:56,550
Son, your faith will lead you
to the Boat of Salvation.

771
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,880
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

772
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:00,050
Me too. I believe in you too!

773
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,520
Daughter, your faith will take you
to the Boat of Salvation.

(MUJI HOSPITAL)

780
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,710
Sang-jin, Dad is...

781
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,480
It's all my fault, Sang-jin.

782
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,520
Sang-jin.

783
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,360
I'm so sorry, Sang-jin.

784
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,760
Sang-jin.

785
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,990
(REST IN PEACE)

786
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,860
Sang-jin.

787
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,570
I'm so sorry.

788
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,470
It's all my fault.

789
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,550
Dad is so sorry
for everything, Sang-jin.

790
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,530
I'm sorry for your loss.

791
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,360
I don't even know what to say.

792
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,530
My heart

793
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,440
breaks for you and your family.

794
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,610
Please don't worry about us.

795
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,710
The fact that you came here like this

796
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,510
is enough to make us grateful.

797
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,450
I'm sure Sang-jin is

798
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,950
resting in peace

799
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,990
in the arms of the Almighty.

800
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,160
From now on,

801
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,820
we will protect you like family.

802
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,460
Thank you.

803
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:57,040
Ms. Kim. This must be
very painful to you too,

804
00:57:58,070 --> 00:57:59,240
but

805
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,040
for Sang-mi's sake,

806
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,680
you should pull yourself together.

807
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,040
I remember Sang-jin as a boy

808
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:37,510
who prayed in the empty hall alone

809
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,980
even though he lost
the use of his one leg.

810
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,580
He was a warm-hearted

811
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,450
and beautiful boy.

812
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,770
However,

813
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,570
after hearing the news
about Sang-jin today,

814
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,580
I couldn't pray at all.

815
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:13,980
Everyone.

816
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:17,080
I'd like to stand here today

817
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,550
as a human being,

818
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,650
not a cleric.

819
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,990
And I'd like to ask the Almighty.

820
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,270
Why?

821
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,270
Why on earth did you take

822
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,110
that precious child?

823
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,950
Why couldn't you

824
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,350
(protect the soul of
that precious child)

825
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,820
(with your power?)

826
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:00,590
You told me you will save

827
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:05,100
your child suffering in agony, so why?

828
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,670
Why did you take him away?

829
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,640
Almighty.

830
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:23,110
I really

831
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,890
resent you for doing this.

832
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,230
Please answer me!

833
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,370
What is your intention?

834
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,740
Why didn't you answer
your child's prayers?

835
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,280
Why did you have to

836
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,480
break this family's hearts so painfully?

837
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,790
I must

838
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,460
hear your answers.

839
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:11,660
This child cried out to you

840
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:15,900
and asked you to save him
so desperately!

841
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,440
Did you really turn away from it?

842
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:47,670
(SAVE ME)

843
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,440
(Sang-jin.)

844
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,540
(I promise.)

845
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,050
(I promise I will
take your revenge on them.)
