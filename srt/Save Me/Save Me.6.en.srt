00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,900
(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,330
(EPISODE 6)

3
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Excuse me.

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,540
I believe we made an awful mistake.
I'd like to apologize again.

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,280
You shouldn't speed up in alleys.

6
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,480
Gosh, I think my shoulder might
have been dislocated. Are you okay?

7
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,620
This is serious.

8
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,720
I didn't want to mention this,

9
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,220
-What is it?
-but my father is a police officer.

10
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,130
Should I call him?

11
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,730
Wait a minute though.

12
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,700
I think I smell alcohol from you three.

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,539
Shall we go to your father and
ask him to run a sobriety test on you?

14
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,270
Would you be okay with that?

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,880
Since it's partly our fault as well,

16
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,840
why don't we settle things here?

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,950
Okay.

18
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,550
Let's do that. Both sides are
to blame for.

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,690
-Don't you agree?
-Yes.

20
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,830
Save me.

21
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,410
Is there

22
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,780
something else you want to say?

23
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,780
Hey, this is all your fault.

24
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,420
Me?

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,250
You said we should take this route.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,120
You're the one who said that.

27
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,889
Forget it. Let's go.

28
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,290
-Drive carefully.
-Thanks.

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,600
Be careful, guys.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,070
Take it.

31
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,470
Hey, help me lift this.

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,770
All right.

33
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,420
Did you see her?

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,690
What? Who?

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,100
Oh, I did. I saw her.

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,230
You're talking about that lady, right?

37
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,130
Yes, she's pretty.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,440
I would've hit on her
if I were 15 years older.

39
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,710
It was Sang-mi, right?

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,080
Yes, it was.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,550
Sang-mi? Sang-mi...

42
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,750
Isn't she that girl from Seoul?

43
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,160
Didn't she fall off the face
of the earth after her brother died?

44
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,420
I thought she moved back to Seoul.
I guess she's back.

45
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,630
What about her?

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,040
Guys, have you ever heard anyone saying,

47
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,870
"Save me"?

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,740
"Save me"?

49
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,740
I clearly heard her saying that
looking at me.

50
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,110
It wasn't "Help me."

51
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,520
She said, "Save me."

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,360
By the way, those guys earlier...

53
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,329
They seemed to be around your age.

54
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you know them by any chance?

55
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,370
Sang-mi?

56
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,580
Well, she left school shortly
after we moved here,

57
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,480
so she probably didn't have any chance
to make friends.

58
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,880
Gosh, please don't worry.

59
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,350
All of us are her friends
and family, you know.

60
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,959
I'll make sure you won't be
lonely anymore--

61
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,230
Apostle Jo.

62
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Yes.

63
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,130
Let's contemplate quietly
from now on.

64
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,360
It's not like we're going
somewhere fun.

65
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,170
Okay.

66
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,940
Almighty, my savior.
I believe in you.

67
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,050
Please relieve me
from pain and suffering...

68
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,190
Are you sure they went this way?

69
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
What are you doing?

70
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,870
A live-streaming broadcast of us
saving a woman in danger,

71
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,270
"Jeong-hun on a Mission".

72
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,300
You better be kidding.

73
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,040
We'll get bombarded with moon balloons.

74
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,840
What? What's that place?

75
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,690
Hey, what are we going to do?

76
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,060
Let's go this way.

77
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,370
All right. Hello, my viewers.

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,409
I'm starting this show rather abruptly.

79
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,570
Today's show will be

80
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,310
a suspenseful motorcycle chase.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,640
The chase has already begun,
so let's get the show started now.

82
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,380
You guys see
that van over there, right?

83
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,490
That van.
We're chasing that van right now.

84
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,920
We're after it with two motorcycles.

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
(GUSEONWON)

86
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,160
Please do not doubt my faith...

87
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,780
The car! Sang-hwan! Sang-hwan!

88
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,620
Sang-hwan, are you all right?
Sang-hwan!

89
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,320
Hey, what?

90
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,390
Mister, drive properly!

91
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,290
Go home! Don't drive ever again!

92
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,730
(GUSEONWON)

93
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,560
Save me, please!

94
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,040
Sang-hwan, are you okay?

95
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,440
-Yes, I'm fine.
-That totally scared me.

96
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,710
I must say, they faithfully
follow traffic rules.

97
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,580
Let go of me. I said, let go.

98
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,679
Sang-mi, I'll never give up on you.

99
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,250
Enough of this.

100
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,620
I said, enough!

101
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,590
They're moving.

102
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
All right, here we go!

103
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,380
-Oh, no.
-What's going on?

104
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,710
Darn it.

105
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,480
-Here are the keys.
-Thank you.

106
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,680
Then we'll come and pick you up
for the sunrise service.

107
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,810
Okay.

108
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,020
Let's go.

109
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,760
Sang-mi.

110
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,260
When things are hard,

111
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,530
think about your mother.

112
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,870
Why would you run away and
leave your fainthearted mother alone?

113
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,740
You know better than anybody else
that you and your dad

114
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,310
are the only ones
who can look after her.

115
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,180
We can do our best,

116
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,410
but we won't do a better job
than the two of you.

117
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,080
You're right.

118
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,250
You must be tired.
You should get going.

119
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,690
Yes, good night.

120
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,290
Aren't you going to come in?

121
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,200
Whatever you're thinking

122
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,170
or trying to do,

123
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,340
Almighty even knows
the number of your hairs.

124
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,950
Don't forget that.

125
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,190
Why are you doing this to me?

126
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,660
Why?

127
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,570
Why on earth are you doing this?

128
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,970
Those people

129
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,140
killed Jeong-gu.

130
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,780
They might even

131
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,120
do something to Mom now.

132
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,850
So please...

133
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,360
Please help me.

134
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,090
Dad.

135
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,500
It's all your fault.

136
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,770
What?

137
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,840
If you hadn't been

138
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,780
so stubborn,

139
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,910
if you had left everything up to Almighty,

140
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,850
I'm sure your mom

141
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,190
would've come back to her old self.

142
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,830
Governor.

143
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,030
Yes?

144
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,600
Aren't you going to do
anything about Sang-hwan?

145
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,050
Here is the thing about him.

146
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,380
When the bird is inside the cage,

147
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,750
it feels like my own.

148
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,520
But when I let the cage open,

149
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,260
it would easily fly away at its will.

150
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,360
Isn't this world too dangerous

151
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,500
for him to live without his parents?

152
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,890
I will call for help.

153
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,400
Even if it survives
with its life barely hanging on,

154
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,000
that's not life.

155
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,820
I believe in Almighty
who rose from the dead.

156
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,790
With your precious blood,

157
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,190
please lead us.

158
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,660
(Please save us with your precious blood.)

159
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,400
(Please wipe away our sins with it,)

160
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,500
(and let us be born again with it.)

161
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,470
(With your precious blood,
please drive out the evil spirits,)

162
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,110
(and save us from them.)

163
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,450
(Please let the evil spirits)

164
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,320
(and those who tempt us)

165
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,120
bring destruction upon themselves.

166
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,920
Help us lead a life of victories,

167
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,060
and defeat the evil.

168
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,200
You're still awake, Mom.

169
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,770
Have you been waiting for me?

170
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,910
You somehow look

171
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,140
so lonely today.

172
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,150
If you look at me like that,

173
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,450
my heart aches.

174
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,099
Save me.

175
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,730
Do you have

176
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,670
something to say to me

177
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,339
just like her?

178
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,109
Why are you looking at me like that?

179
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,520
Mom.

180
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,020
This time,

181
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,420
I don't want to run away.

182
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,170
So,

183
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,370
help me, Mom.

184
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,110
Help me, Mom.

185
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,360
What is it?

186
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,700
Boss. This is my friend
I told you about last time.

187
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,370
Pay your respects.

188
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,940
My name is Seok Dong-cheol.

189
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,140
You just got released from jail.
You should rest.

190
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,780
Why do you want to work?

191
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,240
To make money.

192
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,680
I like that he's rude.

193
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,880
Why do you need money?

194
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,320
To get a girl?

195
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,360
I'm going to buy my grandma a house.

196
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,000
Gosh, did the life in jail
make you a good boy?

197
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,680
Teach him well.

198
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,380
Thank you, sir.

199
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,950
Mom doesn't like
to smell blood in the house.

Sang-hwan.

201
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,690
Do you know when
I started to smell blood?

202
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
It's when I entered elementary school.

203
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,360
Other kids had new pencils,
pencil cases, and bags.

204
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,460
They excitedly ran around the streets.

205
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,930
Do you know

206
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,810
what your grandfather said to me
as he handed me this axe?

207
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,140
"Yong-min."

208
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,010
"Remember the smell of blood."

209
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,210
"If you don't want to smell"

210
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,550
"this disgusting bloody smell ever again,"

211
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,350
"you absolutely cannot be weak."

212
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,560
"Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?"

213
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,730
I said, "Yes, Dad."

214
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,040
I know how you feel.

215
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,510
You've done enough
by agonizing yourself for three years.

216
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,950
You should forget everything

217
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,780
and go back to Seoul now.

218
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,120
Dad.

219
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,920
Why do you keep telling me
to forget about it?

220
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,260
Everyone tells me
to forget about it and move on.

221
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,130
But don't you think it's wrong?

222
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,670
Do you think this
will change anything?

223
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,470
Every living being is born

224
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,840
with a predetermined destiny.

225
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,970
Are you saying that it is my fate
to obey everything you say?

226
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,710
Don't you know

227
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,720
how much I care about you?

228
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,580
I'm doing all of this for you.

229
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,250
That's not true.
You're doing it for yourself.

230
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,290
I know you want to run
for provincial governor.

231
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,830
What are you talking about now?

232
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,390
Like what you did three years ago,

233
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,560
you're trying to get rid of
everything that could pose problems.

Hey, who are you?

237
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,970
Goodness, is he on something or what?

238
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,710
Hey. Even if you're drunk,
you should behave yourself.

239
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,580
What are you doing
at my place of business?

240
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,780
It's heavy.

241
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,780
What was that about?

242
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,550
You trumped me.

243
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,690
Gosh.

244
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,160
-Goodness.
-Look at this color.

245
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,930
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. I apologize.

246
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,400
What happened to you?

Gosh, that guy is something.

Do any of you want to get
your head smacked too?

Well, as you can see, I'm...

251

I'm sorry about today.

Yes, let's do that.

It was starting to bore me anyway.
Let's go.

It's been a long time.

256
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,900
I missed you, Jin-seok.

257
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,930
I waited

258
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,730
nine years to see you.

259
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,640
Is that right?
Has it been that long already?

260
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,510
Gosh, don't hurt my feelings here.

261
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,450
I was put behind bars because you
dumped the murder charge on me.

You can't forget
about something like that, pal.

I wanted to give you a haircut today.

264
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,970
Forget it.

265
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,610
Grow it out a bit more.

266
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,380
That will make your new hairstyle

267
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,380
stand out more.

268
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:49,100
Gosh, you.
You sure don't let me down.

269

Guys. Get some new tools, will you?

271
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,320
I see baseball bats, wooden clubs,
and axes all the time.

272
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,490
Is this a woodworking shop or what?

Do you know this?

284
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,050
I read the bible when I was in the joint.

285
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,390
Do you know that there's a man
named Job in the bible?

286
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,830
That man, Job,

287
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,500
is put through all sorts
of pain and suffering.

288

Do you know why that happened
to him?

289
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,380

he shouldn't be arrogant.

00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,280
Thank you for always looking
after my son and daughter.

334
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,790
Don't mention it.
It's something we should naturally do.

335
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,990
Sang-mi.

336
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,460
If you don't want to worry your mother,

337
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,930
you shouldn't say or do bad things
from now on.

338
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,700
Do you understand?

339
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,800
Mom.

340
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,980
(Spiritual Father.)

341
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,410
(I'm Yun Dal-seong.)

342
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,990
Yes, please come in.

343
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,530
Here. Come and sit down.

344
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,240
Spiritual Father.

345
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,640
Please save me.

346
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,080
Tell me what's going on.

347
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,080
Our Almighty

348
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,350
will protect you.

349
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:29,560
I recently went to the hospital
because I had a stomachache.

350
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,130
And they said I'm terminally ill
with stomach cancer.

351
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,900
Spiritual Father.

352
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,840
Please save me.

353
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,250
I'll give our Almighty my land

354
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,909
and my farm.

355
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,280
I'll give him everything.

356
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,719
So please, Spiritual Father.

357
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,590
Please get rid of the devil

358
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,800
inside my body with Living Water.

359
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,370
Please take everything out of
my body that's evil.

360
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,450
The paradise

361
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,420
is for the ones who are poor in spirit.

362
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,990
If you get rid of your greed,

363
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,960
you'll be able to get on
the Boat of Salvation.

364
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,870
I'll give him everything.

365
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,740
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

366
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,700
I believe it!

367
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:55,850
Grandma.

368
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,950
I bought dried persimmon, your favorite.

369
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,170
How's life there?

370
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,810
You're not wandering around
collecting boxes there too, are you?

371
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,880
I don't

372
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,580
know about anything else.

373
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,530
But I wish you would live
with a straight back in paradise.

374
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,170
Dong-cheol, my baby.

375
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,440
Dong-cheol.

376
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,510
Dong-cheol. My goodness.
My poor baby.

377
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,780
Dong-cheol.

378
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,040
Dong-cheol.

379
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,120
Dong-cheol.

380
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,710
I'm sorry.

381
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,150
I'm sorry for

382
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,590
making you die all alone.

383
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,960
I'm so sorry.

384
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
(GUSEONWON)

385
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,270
Let's begin, Sang-mi.

386
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,910
You heard what Apostle Jo
said to you earlier, right?

387
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,350
You shouldn't say or do
bad things from now on

388
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,580
if you don't want your mother to
worry about you anymore.

389
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,990
Okay?

390
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,270
This is a campaign to donate money
to kids abroad.

391
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,900
Please fill in a survey for us.

392
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,640
Hello. Excuse me.

393
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,870
We're currently holding a campaign
to donate money

394
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
to hungry kids around the world.

395
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,310
Can you fill in a survey for us
if you have time?

396
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,920
-A survey?
-It'll take just one minute.

397
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,430
Okay. What do I need to do?

398
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,930
You can write it over there.

399
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,470
Thank you.

400
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,440
You just need to briefly fill in
your personal information.

401
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,910
-Okay.
-I'm all done.

402
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,880
You must be a student
at a prestigious university.

403
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,790
You must be busy looking for a job
if you're a senior.

404
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,790
Yes, but everyone goes through
the same thing.

405
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,290
I'll be off then.

406
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,730
-Wait.
-Sorry?

407
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,270
Your parents must be very worried.

408
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,370
What do you mean?

409
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,170
The opportunity to make everything better
is right in front of you.

410
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,570
You shouldn't just sit back and
watch it disappear.

411
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,440
I don't quite understand.

412
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,190
Did you see that? This is why
we need to come out here to play pool.

413
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,590
I hit the ball every time.

414
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,820
You just missed.

415
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,520
What are you talking about?

416
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,130
Come on, let's do a proper match.

417
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,860
It didn't miss.

418
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,400
Get out the way.
You're going to get hit. Move.

419
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,440
I'm warning you. You're going to
get hit in the face. I said, move.

420
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,770
Get out of the way. Move.

421
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,840
Sang-hwan, please make him move.
My gosh, this is stressing me out.

422
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,610
Sang-hwan. Sang...

423
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,020
Mr. Han Sang-hwan.

424
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,120
Yes? What? Why?

425
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,260
Are you still thinking about yesterday?

426
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,030
I want to forget about it,
but it keeps popping up in my head.

427
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,930
Just forget about it already.

428
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,870
She'll continue to live well,
just like she did until now.

429
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,040
Why would she have asked me
for help of all people?

430
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,710
Then should we try looking for her?

431
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,570
Do you think you can find her?

432
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,280
Hey, what are you talking about?

433
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,750
And that guy with the curly hair
seemed like a nice guy.

434
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,150
It's okay. Don't worry.

435
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,880
Why would you look for her?

436
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,090
It's okay.

437
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,160
Sang-hwan, just forget about it.

438
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,130
Hey, guys.

439
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,600
Would you call this a coincidence or fate?

440
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
What is it?

441
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,180
There's not much time until
we face the day of salvation.

442
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,320
It's important to live
with a certain kind of value in life.

443
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,990
They say the young adults these days
need to give up on seven things.

444
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,760
Dating, marriage, giving birth,

445
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,000
friends, buying a house,
dreaming, and having hope.

446
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,330
Do you really want to live your life
by giving up on all these things?

447
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,200
Well, not exactly.

448
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,800
So before it gets too late,

449
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,140
you need to think about
what true happiness is

450
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,110
and the kind of values you're going
to live your life with.

451
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,280
If you let your life get swayed by money,
there will be nothing left.

452
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,580
I've been through my 20s,
so I know how important your 20s are.

453
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,220
What are they doing?

454
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,590
Something smells fishy.

455
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,890
That smell's coming from your philtrum.

456
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,830
Let's stop caring
and continue with playing pool.

457
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,870
It doesn't seem like she's in
big trouble from here.

458
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,500
Why do you think she asked us to save her?

459
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,010
We can go check for ourselves.

460
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,310
What? Where are you going?

461
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,850
Don't go there.
You'll only embarrass yourself.

462
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,420
I said, don't go.

463
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,790
The word "Salvation"
is not a difficult word.

464
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,190
If you look here...

465
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,360
Hey, you guys are the ones who...

466
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,230
Do you

467
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,540
really need help?

468
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,210
I'll help you if you're in danger.

469
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,340
What are you talking about?

470
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,340
If you disturb us like this,
we're going to call the police.

471
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,150
On what basis are you going
to call the police?

472
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,180
Tell me if you have a legal basis.

473
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,950
We're going to call the police
if you do this. The police.

474
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,890
The police.
We're going to call them.

475
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,890
Sang-mi, why don't you tell them yourself?

476
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,530
Tell them if you're in danger or not.

477
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,970
If you don't want to worry your mother,

478
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,340
you shouldn't say or do bad things
from now on.

479
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,470
Do you understand?

480
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,790
It's okay, so tell me the truth.

481
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,820
If you're really in danger,

482
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,960
I promise I'll help you this time.

483
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,540
You should go back.

484
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,140
What?

485
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,310
Please,

486
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,310
get lost.

487
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:16,980
She just said it herself.

488
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,550
Are you being serious right now?

489
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,260
Let's go, Sang-mi.

490
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,800
Your spirit will die if you keep
interacting with an evil spirit.

491
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,970
Let's hurry up and go.

492
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,720
Please drive.

493
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,560
My dear Almighty, please save us.

494
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,440
Let's go.

495
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,740
Let's just go now.

496
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,450
Come on.

497
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,660
(THE BOAT OF SALVATION
WILL SAVE YOU)

498
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,040
Let me go already!

499
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,780
Apostle Kang.

500
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,080
You came in early today.

501
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,150
Are you already finished
with bringing in new brethren?

502
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,920
We had to leave in the middle
because the devil showed up.

503
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,930
What are you talking about?

504
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,460
Those young men who crashed
into our car yesterday showed up,

505
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,330
and they started to tempt her
with the words of the devil.

506
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,000
What?

507
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,040
The devil shall disappear.

508
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,610
Under the name of Almighty,

509
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,310
you will be cleansed.

510
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:22,510
My gosh.

511
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,340
See?

512
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,580
The devil's approaching you
because your spirit is evil.

513
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,720
Yes. He's right, Sang-mi.

514
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,090
Only the chosen believers
with clean spirits

515
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,130
-can get on the Boat of Salvation.
-I believe it.

516
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,030
You also need to get on that boat
in order to meet your brother.

517
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,530
Don't you agree?

518
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,140
Yes, you're right.

519
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,810
I'm sure that everyone
in our family will be able to

520
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,080
get on the Boat of Salvation
and go to paradise.

521
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,580
I'm going to make that happen

522
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,290
no matter what.

523
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,650
I believe it.

524
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,630
Gosh, listen to me.

525
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,300
My wife said she's going
to take the kids to a weird church

526
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,670
and live there.

527
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,670
Who wouldn't get mad at that?

528
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,280
Hey, but you still shouldn't have broken
Mr. Jeon's signboard.

529
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,320
The signboard was blocking my way.
He's the one who started the fight.

530
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,090
Do you want me to call your uncle?

531
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,190
Hey.

532
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,760
Do you want to see me get my legs broken?

533
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,990
Take your hands off my desk.

534
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,490
My gosh, this darn town.

535
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,530
I'm so sick of it.

536
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,500
Sir, where are you going?

537
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,670
Please find my granddaughter for me.

538
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,610
Ma'am, you need to talk
to a detective for that.

539
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,070
I only came here to run an errand.

540
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,380
What? What did you say?

541
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:08,510
You need to talk to a detective.
A detective.

542
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,780
My gosh, what are you
talking about right now?

543
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,220
I'm asking you to find
my granddaughter for me.

544
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,390
What's going on?

545
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,030
Hello. Apparently, her granddaughter
hasn't returned after she left home.

546
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,860
So she wants me to look for her.

547
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,800
Ma'am, when did your granddaughter
leave home?

548
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:26,900
What?

549
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,600
What's he saying?

550
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,840
When did your granddaughter leave home?

551
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,310
It's been over a month already.

552
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,450
I'll look into it and give you a call.

553
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,860
What? My goodness,
you're going to be blessed.

554
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,920
Pardon?

555
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,390
Okay, ma'am.

556
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:59,100
-Get home safely.
-Oh, dear. I'm so grateful.

557
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,810
(RELIGION, A RUNAWAY?)

558
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,950
Has this lady become a believer too?

559
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,450
Sang-hwan.

560
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,890
To be honest,

561
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,600
you wouldn't want others to interfere
in your family affairs, right?

562
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,000
All families have their own stories.

563
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,640
I bet you there isn't a single family
without a story.

564
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,540
All families fight and make up repeatedly.

565
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:40,870
That's how life is.

566
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,810
Even the police don't interfere
in others' family affairs.

567
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,450
What if

568
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,050
that isn't the case?

569
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,490
What?

570
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:57,090
I need your help. Help my brother.

571
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,120
What's the matter?

572
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,860
I think he's been taken to the rooftop.

573
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,000
You said you could take care of it.

574
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,500
Dong-cheol, let's just go play basketball.

575
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,970
All right.

576
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,550
Save me.

577
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,820
That's what happened three years ago.

578
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,920
I ignored her,

579
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,690
but she really needed our help.

580
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,200
What if it's the same case this time?

581
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,230
What should we do?

582
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,900
Then should we go check out
their hideout?

583
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,910
What's wrong with you?

584
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,940
Anyway, how would we find out
where their hideout is?

585
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,440
We last saw the van at the crossroads
near Yongmi-eup, right?

586
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,610
Yes. Did you think of something?

587
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,620
I'm sure they have ordered
in Chinese food at least once.

588
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,570
They don't order jjajangmyeon,

589
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,400
but they do seem to order my boss
to come and go often.

590
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,500
Gosh, brother.

591
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,710
We're here because we wanted to see you.

592
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,370
-Do you think I'm your girlfriend?
-I know you don't have one.

593
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,140
What did you just say?

594
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,880
Recently, near Yongmi-eup,

595
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,220
have you made any deliveries
to strange people?

596
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,690
Strange people?

597
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,020
For instance, a guy with curly hair
that doesn't even suit him,

598
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,860
a lady who looks like she's shooting
laser beams through her eyes,

599
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,890
and a really gorgeous girl from Seoul.

600
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,730
-Isn't that right?
-What kind of people are they?

601
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,770
What kind of nonsense is that?

602
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,500
Please think carefully.

603
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,870
Gosh. As you know,
I know Yongmi-eup really well, but...

604
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,310
Wait. There goes Red Pepper.
Hey, Red Pepper.

605
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,110
Get over here.

606
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,680
-What is it?
-Hey, Red Pepper.

607
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,620
Didn't you hand out fliers recently
in Yongmi-eup?

608
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,960
My boss told me to. I had no choice.

609
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,390
-Should I have quit?
-Cut it out.

610
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,630
Recently,

611
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,430
have you ever made a delivery
to a place

612
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,900
where there's a gorgeous girl
that you keep thinking about?

613
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,400
You shouldn't leave this out.

614
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,100
There's not only that gorgeous girl.

615
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,870
Wait a minute. You must be talking
about that girl with pale skin.

616
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,780
-That's right.
-I saw her once.

617
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,580
I guess I did keep thinking about her.

618
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,380
When did you see her?

619
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,580
I was just at that place
to make a delivery.

620
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,320
Did you hear him?
Do you see what I'm saying?

621
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,550
We never forget a beautiful face.

622
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,560
-I truly respect you.
-Shut your mouth.

623
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,360
Where is it?

624
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,500
Do you plan on going right now?

625
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,970
We have the address now.
Let's go home for now and meet tomorrow.

626
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,940
This isn't like you.
You would normally go right away.

627
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,670
As the saying goes,
"Make haste slowly."

628
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,610
I'm going now.

629
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,780
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

630
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,350
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

631
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,160
We'll hook you up with guys, ladies.

632
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,160
We'll hook you up with guys, ladies.

633
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,530
We'll...

634
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,630
Gosh. This is so embarrassing.

635
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,130
What am I doing?

636
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:31,240
Good for you.
A guy should know how to act tough.

637
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:37,880
Do you like the work?

638
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,180
It's all right.

639
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,180
How about we have a drink after work?

640
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,520
Sure.

641
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,750
Mister.

642
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,790
Do you guys really hook people up
and serve unlimited drinks?

643
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,760
Why are you looking for a club?
Let's just go to a karaoke.

644
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,830
He's right.

645
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,570
We can hook you up and serve
unlimited drinks.

646
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,410
We specialize in finding you dates.

647
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,610
We're number one in this business.

648
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,290
Forget about it. That's life.

649
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,130
After graduating high school,
I always thought I'd join a gang

650
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,560
and become a boss.

651
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,500
Who knew I'd end up like this?

652
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,300
Have a smoke.

653
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,640
Forget about it.

654
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,840
You just got released.
You should be careful.

655
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,780
Come here.
Where do you think you're going?

656
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,950
Let me go. Please let me go.

657
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,590
Come here. Get over here.

658
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,820
-Get over here. Get in. Get in.
-Please let me go.

659
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,660
Don't lose your temper.

660
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,430
It's none of your business.

661
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,760
I don't think when I fight.

662
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,030
It's all about guts for me.

663
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,550
What does he think he's doing?

664
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,280
Get out on the count of three.

665
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,320
Has he lost his mind?

666
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,750
-One,
-What?

667
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,390
two.

668
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,530
What?

669
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,760
and three!

670
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,600
Gosh. Is that guy crazy?

671
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,200
Goodness.

672
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,010
What's he doing?

673
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,980
He's a complete nut case.

674
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,290
Gosh.

675
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,590
Are you crazy?

676
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,560
Didn't I tell you

677
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,200
to get out on the count of three?

678
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,440
I warned you.

679
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,340
Hey.

680
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,940
Did you think you would become
a hero by coming here alone?

681
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,540
What are you guys doing here?

682
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,940
We're a team, aren't we?

683
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,150
Hold on one second.

684
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,020
What are you doing?

685
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:10,560
I'm risking my life here.
I wanted to get some moon balloon blast.

686
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,420
I'll be quiet. Don't worry.

687
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:14,790
You really have to be quiet.

688
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,260
Once we climb over that wall,

689
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,070
there's no turning back.
I'm serious.

690
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,800
Are you guys ready?

691
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,200
We're ready.

692
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,610
Let's go then.

693
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,280
(NO LIVE ANIMAL WAS USED
FOR THE SCENE)

694
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,290
(SAVE ME)
