00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,240
Mom.

5
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,380
Please have some water at least.

6
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,390
You haven't eaten anything.

7
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,860
We shouldn't...

8
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,060
We shouldn't have moved here.

9
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,630
Mom, please.

10
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,000
Get this out of my face!

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,370
Have you forgotten what happened
to Sang-jin? How can I drink water?

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,880
Mom.

13
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,350
Honey.

14
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,380
Why are you taking it out on Sang-mi?

15
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm sorry, Sang-mi.

16
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,310
Mom is...

17
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,310
I'm really sorry.

18
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,320
It's okay, Mom. You have nothing
to apologize for.

19
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,490
I should've taken better care
of the two of you.

20
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm so sorry
that I wasn't a better mom.

21
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,410
I didn't want my life

22
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,910
to turn out like my mom's.

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,750
My mom

24
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,620
died and left her child all alone.

25
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,730
I didn't want to be
an irresponsible mom like her.

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,630
But in the end,

27
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,100
I couldn't protect my child either.

28
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,940
I've become an irresponsible mom
I used to despise so much.

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,310
Sang-mi.

30
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,120
You should step out
for some fresh air.

31
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,390
I'll stay here.

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,860
-That time, I--
-Why did you do that?

35
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,300
Why did you approach me that day

36
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,370
if you were going to do that?

37
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,780
-Let's take a break!
-Okay!

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,940
(-Let's go.
-That wasn't bad.)

39
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,650
(-Wait up.
-Let's go.)

40
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,820
(Why is it so hot?
It's scorching hot today.)

41
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,050
(-Catch this, okay?
-You should do it like this.)

42
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,420
(-Like this.
-Catch it.)

43
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,460
(-Gosh, throw it higher.
-Darn it.)

44
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,830
(-Is this hard for you?
-Higher.)

45
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,860
(-Hey, throw it now.
-Catch it.)

46
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,670
Do you remember us?

47
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,300
The other day
when it rained a lot...

48
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,970
Yes.

49
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,780
It's nice to meet you. I'm the most
handsome guy here, Han Sang-hwan.

50
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,280
How embarrassing.

51
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,250
And that dumb-looking guy
over there is Seok Dong-cheol.

52
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,290
What is it that you want to say?

53
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,760
Oh, well...

54
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,290
Would you like to

55
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,000
play with us?

56
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,830
-What?
-Can kids in Seoul play volleyball?

57
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,480
-Dong-cheol, it's your turn.
-Me? Okay.

58
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,220
-Idiot.
-Goodness.

59
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,560
-Gosh!
-Oh, my.

60
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,700
Gosh, that girl is scary.

61
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,900
Hey, stop! It's...

62
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,570
It's okay.

63
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,880
You can smile?

64
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,080
Dong-cheol.

65
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,020
Did you just see her smiling?

66
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,260
Well, you look a little cute
with a smile on.

67
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,060
Hey, hey. Don't!

68
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Take it.

69
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,040
What is it?

70
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,510
That tiny hand of yours

71
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,050
must be tired from spiking
the ball like that.

72
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,050
Drink it.

73
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
I used to be
in a school volleyball team.

74
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,330
Oh, I see.

75
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,030
You're the one who got hit
by the ball. You should drink it.

76
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,540
Hey, get your facts straight.

77
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,210
I didn't... I didn't get hit.

78
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,840
For goodness' sake.

79
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,650
Then what is it?

80
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,950
I let you hit me with the ball.

81
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,690
Why are you being like this to me?

82
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,290
Is it because I'm new here
and alone all the time?

83
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,600
Are you pitying me?

84
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,000
We're friends.
Why does there have to be a reason?

85
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,200
We're in the same class,
which means we're friends.

86
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,000
Do people in Seoul need
a reason for befriending someone?

87
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,950
Leave.

88
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,050
-What?
-Don't show up before me again.

89
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,990
Yes.

90
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,160
Yes, okay. Of course. I understand.

91
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,030
Bye.

92
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,570
My gosh, what is it this time?

93
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,200
Hello.

94
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,770
-So what happened?
-He--

95
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,570
I was doing so well in the field
today.

96
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,740
My gosh.

97
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,880
I think there was some violence
involved. The student who died--

98
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,580
I heard he was mentally ill.

99
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,850
I heard that he even tried to commit
suicide a few times in Seoul.

100
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,550
What about the CCTV footage?

101
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,650
The school rooftop doesn't
have a CCTV installed.

102
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,920
But one student took a video
of what happened with a cell phone.

103
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,130
I heard he fell from the rooftop
by himself.

104
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,160
Right.

105
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,960
Then let's just send those boys
back home.

106
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,500
-Pardon?
-Their school just called.

107
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,300
They're expecting an investigation
from the Office of Education soon.

108
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,140
So they don't want this case
to become a big issue.

109
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,540
And it's not just that.
Come over here.

110
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,810
It's better for us to end this quietly,

111
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,780
so that those kids can have
a bright future.

112
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,880
-But--
-Don't you agree?

113
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,520
Chief Kim, how in the world are you
handling things at work?

114
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,550
My kid is a victim here.

115
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,290
Isn't it obvious? Can't you see
the bruise on his eye?

116
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,930
My gosh, you can't just
barge in like this.

117
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,990
You're making things difficult for us.

118
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,500
Sir, please calm down.

119
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,530
What? How do you expect me to
calm down?

120
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,370
My son got beaten up by...

121
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,900
There he is. My son got beaten up
by that gangster over there.

122
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,740
But how do you expect me
to be calm?

123
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,940
Sir, we have to go through a certain
process when we take care of things.

124
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,650
Calm down. I already gave orders

125
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,220
to let your son go back home
before you came.

126
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,550
Okay? Let's go.

127
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,390
How about we drink some
ginseng soju tonight?

128
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,360
Let's go.

129
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,190
(-Hey, let's go play pool.)
-I'm hungry.

130
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,790
My gosh, this is so annoying.

131
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,400
-Let's go to a karaoke room.
-I said, I'm hungry.

132
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,560
My goodness.
You better come to your senses.

133
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,830
Stop it, seriously!

134
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,870
You better not get bad grades
this semester.

135
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,000
Do you understand?

136
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,300
Okay.

137
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,580
This is why we shouldn't
take in people from other areas.

138
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,980
He's right.
Our kids did nothing wrong.

139
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,550
What if their grades go down? Will
you be responsible for that?

140
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,420
I'll make sure nothing gets in the
way of their studies.

141
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,390
I'll trust that you'll handle
this well.

142
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,890
Okay. Goodbye.

143
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,330
I'll see you at our next morning
soccer club gathering.

144
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,230
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

145
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,530
Drive safely, sir.

146
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,330
Study hard.

147
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,700
My gosh. Goodbye, sir.

148
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,570
Bye.

149
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,970
Bye.

150
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Bye.

151
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,150
My gosh, how badly did they
educate their kids?

152
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,920
Mister! Mister!

153
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,990
My gosh.

154
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,890
-Who are you?
-Mister.

155
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,990
Why did you let those guys go?

156
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,560
I'm not a "Mister". I'm a detective.

157
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,860
If you're a detective,
you shouldn't do this.

158
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,500
My friend's still inside,
but why did you let them go?

159
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,600
He's right.

160
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,170
My gosh, you guys are so annoying.

161
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,570
Hey, who are you to tell me
what to do?

162
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,870
He's Han Sang-hwan.

163
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,880
-Han Sang-hwan?
-Don't you know him?

164
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,250
He's the only son of

165
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,350
Governor Han Yong-min, the man who
is loved and respected by

166
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,920
the citizens of our country.

167
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,090
So what?

168
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,560
What do you want to know?

169
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,430
Why aren't you releasing Dong-cheol?

170
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,030
We still need to investigate him
a little more.

171
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,770
-"Investigate him"?
-The victims sued him for assault.

172
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,270
If they don't come to an agreement,
he won't be able to leave today.

173
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,970
I'm busy, so I'm going to go now.

174
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,410
Wait.

175
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
What?

176
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,080
Sang-jin.

177
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,180
-Sang-jin.
-Sang-jin. Sang-jin.

178
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,180
Sang-jin.

179
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,190
Sang-jin! Sang-jin!

180
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,550
She needs to go relieve herself.
If she relieves herself outdoors,

181
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,850
it'll feel very nice.

182
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,920
It'll feel nice with the wind blowing.

183
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,810
Sang-jin.

184
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,510
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,650
I should've protected you.

186
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,640
Sang-jin.

187
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,580
To be honest,

188
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,410
it was so difficult to be with you.

189
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,420
So...

190
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,590
So I sometimes wished that...

191
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,160
I sometimes wished that...

192
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,300
I wished that--

193
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,340
Sang-mi, you should be careful.

194
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,440
You have a bright future
ahead of you.

195
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,480
(MUJI POLICE STATION)

196
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,080
Hey, go to school.

197
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,510
-Sorry?
-They dropped charges against you.

198
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,020
So go back to school, don't
beat anyone up, and study hard.

199
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Okay?

200
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,890
Hey, you guys! I have some big news!

201
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,150
-What?
-What?

202
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,520
Dong-cheol's going to get expelled.

203
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,060
-What?
-What?

204
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,620
I feel sorry for him.

205
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,760
The others are just going to
write

206
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,500
a letter of apology for going up
to the rooftop without permission.

207
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,460
(-I can't believe this.
-Are you serious?)

208
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,200
By the way, our next class
isn't physical education anymore.

209
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,700
Our homeroom teacher's
going to come.

210
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,440
You guys need to get changed
into your uniforms again.

211
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,819
Hey, Dong-cheol.

212
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,670
Dong-cheol.

213
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,700
What are you doing here?

214
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,980
Didn't you hear
what Mr. Principal said? Go home

215
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,210
and reflect on what you did.

216
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,120
Can't you hear me?

217
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,720
Class President. Go and bring
the Physical Education teacher.

218
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,860
Don't you think
you're being too harsh on him?

219
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,560
-What did you say?
-What did Dong-cheol do so wrong?

220
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,270
Those jerks should be expelled,
not him.

221
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,130
Sang-hwan.

222
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,940
How can you be like this
as a teacher?

223
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,770
Sang-hwan.

224
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,580
I'll let this slide
because of your dad.

225
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,050
Got it?

226
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,120
Dong-cheol.

227
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,350
Hey, are you really just going
to leave like this?

228
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,330
Hey. Whether you rebel or protest,
you need to do something.

229
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,630
Sang-hwan.

230
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,540
My dad is

231
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,840
a total roughneck who's alcoholic.

232
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,310
What are you talking about now?

233
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,680
My dad

234
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,380
doesn't have the power that your
dad has. That's what I'm saying.

235
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,620
Do you know what people think
when they see you?

236
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,690
Your powerful dad.

237
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,060
Then do you know what they think
when they see me?

238
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,900
A construction laborer.

239
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
A roughneck.

240
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,210
-Dong-cheol--
-From the principal to the police,

241
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,250
no one listens to me no matter
how hard I try to explain.

242
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,680
You know that too.

243
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,390
So,

244
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,490
don't waste your energy like this.

245
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,800
Hey, Dong-cheol!

246
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,300
You're no one other than yourself.

247
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,840
You should know that you've

248
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,710
never reminded me of your father.

249
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,880
So don't be such an idiot!

250
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,750
Stand tall.

251
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,520
Stop blabbing away, you idiot.

252
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,390
Stand tall yourself.

253
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,730
Hey, shut it!

254
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,400
I'll see you after school.

255
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,610
-Vote for Number Two,
-Vote for Number Two,

256
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,080
-Han Yong-min!
-Han Yong-min!

257
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,650
-Vote for Number Two,
-Vote for Number Two,

258
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,150
-Han Yong-min!
-Han Yong-min!

259
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,950
-Vote for him. Thank you.
-I'll modernize the markets,

260
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,790
and I'll do my best
to attract more tourists.

261
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,630
Who am I?

262
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,600
I'm a faithful servant of Muji-gun.

263
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,630
Gosh, what's taking
Sang-hwan so long?

264
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,270
Shall I try calling him?

265
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Just leave him alone. You know that
he's busy because of the election.

266
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,740
He should tell us if he's going
to be late. He needs a lesson.

267
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,750
Hey, where are you going?

268
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,080
Boss.

269
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,050
May I use the washroom?

270
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,420
Yes, go ahead.

271
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,020
-Thank you, Boss.
-All right.

272
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,490
Go on.

273
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,700
I'm worried.

274
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,270
Will he be okay?

275
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,240
He's been chuckling like
a crazy guy since he got expelled.

276
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,570
It's making me anxious.

277
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,580
Let's believe in him and wait.
He's a strong person, you know.

278
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,050
He is strong indeed.

279
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,180
-I'm curious about something.
-What is it?

280
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,490
Who do you think will win
if Sang-hwan and Dong-cheol fight?

281
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,020
All right, keep on living
simple-mindedly.

282
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,590
Don't think about anything.

283
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,900
-Are you belittling me now?
-Yes, I am.

284
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,300
Let's drop it.
I'll go get some water.

285
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,160
Dong-cheol.

286
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,660
Are you okay?

287
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,200
Hey, just focus
on relieving yourself.

288
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,800
I'm going to have a smoke.

289
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,550
-You jerks.
-What's your problem?

290
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,320
-You idiots.
-Gosh, hey.

291
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,860
-Stop.
-Come here.

292
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,590
-Hey, come here.
-Stop. Don't.

293
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,490
Dong-cheol.

294
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,720
Jeong-hun, come out right now.

295
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,490
-What's the matter?
-Hurry up, please.

296
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,530
-Gosh. Why? What's happening?
-Hurry.

297
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,700
Pay before you go.

298
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,330
Are you guys crazy?
Where do you think you're going?

299
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,570
If you leave without paying again,
I'll call your parents. Got it?

300
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,840
-Hey, me too!
-Gosh, seriously.

301
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,940
Gosh, darn it.

302
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,010
-I'll step on your shoes.
-Go away.

303
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,480
-Go before I get mad at you.
-Bye.

304
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,020
Bye, guys.

305
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,450
Gosh, these are brand new.

306
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,460
What's all this?

307
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,730
Ma'am, something urgent
has come up.

308
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Don't even dream
I'll believe that, you punk.

309
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,540
He's saying there's an emergency.

310
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,180
Is that so? Then shall I go ahead
and call your parents urgently?

311
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,610
My parents? Gosh, there's no need.

312
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,580
-Sang-hwan.
-Sang-hwan.

313
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,780
What are you two doing here?
Where's Dong-cheol?

314
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,530
Dong-cheol!

315
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,840
Are you sure it's this way?

316
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,340
I saw him going this way.

317
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,540
We won't be able to find him
like this. Let's scatter.

318
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,680
You two should head downtown.
I'll go this way.

319
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,250
-All right.
-Call us if you find him.

320
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,380
Okay, I will.

321
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,780
You jerk.

322
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
-What's your problem?
-Scum.

323
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,630
Hey.

324
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,370
Someone died because of you.

325
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,970
How can you laugh?

326
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,770
Why is that my fault?

327
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,870
Don't you know that he was
mentally ill?

328
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,180
-Turn yourself in.
-Stop spewing nonsense.

329
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,850
Why are you bothering me like this?
You crazy jerk.

330
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,220
Don't you know who my dad is?

331
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,730
I have

332
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,230
no interest in your stuck-up dad.

333
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,750
I'll confess!
I'll tell them everything.

334
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,520
I'll confess. I will.

335
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,920
I'll tell them that
it was my fault

336
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,690
-and that he died because of me.
-You piece of--

337
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,650
I'm serious. I mean it.

338
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,220
Trust me.

339
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,160
To tell you the truth,
I've been so distressed

340
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,230
ever since he died like that.

341
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,760
I really mean it.

342
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,570
I'm sorry.

343
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,870
Because of me, he died,

344
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,440
and you got expelled.

345
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,480
I'm really sorry for everything.

346
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,560
Go to the police station right now
and tell them everything.

347
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,760
You got that?

348
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,030
Okay.

349
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,880

350
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,810
Dong-cheol!

351
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,120
Dong-cheol! Dong-cheol!

352
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,590
Dong-cheol!

353
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,970
Try screaming, you jerk.
Try screaming out loud!

354
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,280
Who do you think you are
to come at me like that?

355
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,380
You shouldn't lash out at me
if you're incompetent.

356
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Just resent your
good-for-nothing parents.

357
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,320
Dong-cheol, are you okay?

358
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,390
Let's go.

359
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,270
Hey!

360
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,810
Dong-cheol!

361
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,610
I'm sorry.

362
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,520
It's all my fault.

363
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,820
I should've protected him.

364
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,160
Sang-mi.

365
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,030
Open the door.

366
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,470
What?

367
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,270
Hurry up and open the door.

368
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,140
Your brother can't come in
because the door is closed.

369
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,710
Honey.

370
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,980
You should go
and open the door for him.

371
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,810
Sang-jin can't come in because
the door's closed.

372

Honey.

Honey!

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,020
Sang-jin

375
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,360
isn't here anymore.

376
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,260
It's all because of you.

377
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,700
If...

378
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,870
If you didn't bring us here...

379
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,480
If you hadn't stood surety
for that debt,

380
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,680
then nothing like this
would've happened to us.

381
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,180
It's all your fault.

382
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,250
Mom.

383
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,820
Go away.

384
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,090
It's your fault too.

385
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,720
You...

386
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,630
You already knew how much
your brother was suffering.

387
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,030
But why did you do that?

388
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,260
Why did you just leave him to die?

389
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,790
See?

390
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,830
Sang-jin's shivering with fear
right now.

391
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,510
Hey.

392
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,280
Thankfully,
we were able to save him.

393
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,050
But what's wrong?

394
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,150
Well...

395
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,820
His spine got severely injured.

396
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,160
So he won't be able to
walk anymore.

397
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,460
What? What did you say?

398
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,860
Transfer him right now.

399
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,430
Transfer him to a bigger hospital
in Seoul!

400
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,900
Okay, I understand.

(THE QUALIFIED GOVERNOR,

Are you sure that Sang-hwan
was at the crime site?

403
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,900
Yes. They just checked the
CCTV footage.

404
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,630
Does the head of the union know that
Sang-hwan was involved?

405
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,930
We've told the police to
keep it from him for now,

406
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,240
so he thinks that it was only
Seok Dong-cheol who was at the site.

407
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,110
We have to blame Seok Dong-cheol
for everything.

408
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,750
You know how important the head of
the union's role is

409
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,520
in winning this election.

410
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,120
-But Sang-hwan--
-We can take that kid out

I'm sorry, Sang-mi.

I don't think my prayers are
going to be answered.

He's Detective Lee Kang Su.

419

I've met you once
at the county district's event.

Yes, I remember you now.

Well, no.

-Sir.
-Yes?

How long has it been since you
came here from Seoul?

It's my third year.

Here you go, sir.

Chief Kim.

431
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,560
I heard that the Criminal Affairs
Division needs a new team manager.

432
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,330
Don't you think our county deserves
to have a team leader

433
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,400
who has gained a lot of experience
from Seoul?

434
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,800
Exactly.

435
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,400
There's someone I've been
keeping in mind.

436
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,070
May I recommend someone for
our county?

437
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,940
Yes, okay.

438
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,840
Okay. Let's have a meal
together soon.

439
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,980
Sure. Okay.

440
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,590
I heard that you're in charge of

00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,700
Oh, yes.

444
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,210
My son told me that

445
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,440
he witnessed the incident
while he was passing by.

446
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,610
Am I correct?

447
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,080
Yes.

448
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,720
There's a CCTV footage that shows
the assailant following the victim.

449
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,680
And they both had grudges against
each other.

450
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,660
Your son only needs to testify
what he saw as a witness.

451
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,130
Well, the thing is, my son got very
shocked from what happened.

452
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,700
So I'd like to have him stay at home
for a while.

453
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,570
Is there no other way?

454
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,740
Yes, I'm sure he must've
been shocked.

Then please just send me a written
statement via mail.

Oh, really?

00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,790
I hope you carry out a fair
investigation,

459
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,720
so that nobody gets falsely accused.

460
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,960
Yes, of course. I'll carry out
a fair investigation.

461
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,230
There.

462
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,330
Please eat.

463
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,740
Have you ever had this dish before?

464
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,780
No, this is my first time.

465
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,010
They make this dish by
skinning the cow,

466
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,350
and gathering the residues of
what's underneath the skin.

467
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,150
They say farm servants used to

468
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,850
use that method to boil soup
in the past.

469
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
How does it taste?

470
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,960
It's delicious.

471
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,760
It's nice to have a nice, warm
meal with you like this.

472
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,430
It makes it feel like we're family.

once in a while.

I'll serve you well
with loyalty, Governor Han.

477

Governor? You shouldn't call me
that.

been held yet.

always a governor, sir.

All I ask of you is to focus on
serving the public well.

I'm sure we'll make a great team.

486
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,850
We'll be living until we're
100 years old.

487
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,690
I should stay healthy in order
not to grow old sick in bed.

488
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,490
You'll be going to paradise.
There's no need for you to worry.

489
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,130
A healthy body makes a healthy soul.

490
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,030
That way, I'll be able to focus more
on my mission work.

491
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,660
You have a point.

492
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,730
Apostle Jo, you always enjoyed
working out in the past.

493
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,980
You must be nostalgic for
the old days, Spiritual Father.

494
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,520
I was a sinner in the past, but
I'm a new man now.

495
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,480
I should be grateful.

496
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,120
I should be going now.

497
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,020
By the way,

498
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,790
I have a question for you.

499
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,200
Why are you paying so much attention

500
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,930
to that family that moved here
from Seoul?

501
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,310
It's a revelation from Almighty.

502
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,840
Come on.

503
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,050
You can be honest with me.

504
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,280
What is it really?

505
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,520
Do you intend on making her
your girlfriend?

506
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,620
You know what I mean.

507
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,430
I've left all matters related to
the management of Guseonwon

508
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,240
in your hands, haven't I?

509
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,040
Yes, that's right.

510
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,210
Then I'm sure you haven't
forgotten the fact that you've

511
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,150
entrusted me with anything
that has to do with

512
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,820
bringing salvation.

513
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,620
Sang-mi

514
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,390
is our Virgin Mary that
will lead us

515
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,530
to the Boat of Salvation.

516
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,030
Rather than seeing this in the
eyes of the world,

517
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,440
try looking at it through the
eyes of the soul,

518
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,210
Apostle Jo.

519
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,650
Virgin?

520
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,120
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

521
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,600
Excuse me, Mister.

522
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,130
You're here.

523
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,800
Mister, are you ignoring my calls
on purpose?

524
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,440
Why would I dare ignore the calls
of a governor's son?

525
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,010
What will happen to Dong-cheol?

526
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,880
How many times have I told you?
I'm still investigating.

527
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,710
I witnessed the incident.

528
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,410
Why won't you take my statement?

529
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,120
-Aren't you friends with him?
-Yes.

530
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,390
That's exactly why your statement
has no credibility.

531
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,720
In other words, because of your
relationship with Seok Dong-cheol,

532
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,520
your testimony lacks objectivity.

533
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,190
Now do you understand me?

534
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,430
Would you have been like this if
he were from a wealthy family?

535
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,100
Let me give you some advice.

536
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,840
If you want to see your friend get
out quickly, don't do anything.

537
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,010
Let the adults take care of things.
Staying put will help your friend.

538
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,180
If I stay put,

539
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,540
will that really help solve
anything?

540
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,920
That brat.

541
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,460
Yes, Apostle Kang. It's me.

542
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,030
I plan on making a visit to
a believer that lives in Seoul.

543
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,760
I see.

544
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,570
And please continue to take
good care of

545
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,800
Sang-mi and her family.

546
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,610
All right.

547
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,710
This coffee tastes amazing.

548
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,880
Sang-mi, you could start
a coffee business.

549
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,520
By the way, why did you leave
the front door open?

550
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,560
Mom says she feels a bit stuffy.

551
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,970
I'd like to pray for your mother.

552
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,980
That's a good idea. Why don't you
and I pray for her too, Sang-mi?

553
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,830
Dear our eternal savior,
Almighty,

554
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,300
I am praying today for the
terrible pain.

555
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,470
Brethren Im Ju-ho's family
is going through.

556
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,370
Though this family may
be suffering

557
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,070
and grieving over the distress
they've been forced to deal with,

558
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,710
help them realize they mustn't look
for answers from useless things

559
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,050
and that you, Almighty, are the only
key to all their problems.

560
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,350
Please help them realize that
you are Almighty of the millennium.

561
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,720
I lift up everything to you,
Almighty. Please answer my prayers.

562
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,190
-My savior, my love.
-My savior, my love.

563
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,990
-Almighty.
-Almighty.

564
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,470
Don't worry, Brethren.

565
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,800
It's all my fault my son

566
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,670
died like that

567
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,640
and my wife is sick.

568
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,010
If my business hadn't failed,

569
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,850
all of this

570
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,220
wouldn't have happened to our family.

571
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,490
Mr. Jo here says that

572
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,630
all misfortunes and happiness
are the will of Almighty.

573
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
He also wishes you the best.

574
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
That's right.
Almighty has his reasons.

575
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,240
I'm sure he has something
prepared for you.

576
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,280
I'm sure he has his reasons for
making you face this hardship.

577
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,150
Why don't we pray together and
wait patiently?

578
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,890
(MUJI HANGIL NURSING HOME)

579
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,490
Dad.

580
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,430
Is this about that friend you
mentioned before?

581
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,230
Yes.

582
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,030
Dong-cheol didn't do anything wrong.

583
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,300
Dad, you trust me, don't you?

584
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,710
Of course. I trust you.

585
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,140
But Sang-hwan,

586
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,310
even if what happened that day
was an accident like you said,

587
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,150
isn't it true that the accident
did happen

588
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,620
because of Dong-cheol?

589
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,490
It's not as simple as you think.

590
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,820
Then,

591
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,860
I'll testify in court.

592
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,060
-What?
-If the police don't believe me,

593
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,730
the judge will make the
right judgement.

594
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,230
I understand how you feel.

595
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,800
I'll do whatever it takes

596
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,140
to get Dong-cheol out once
I get elected.

597
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,510
So don't testify in court.

598
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,950
Is it because of that
head of the union?

599
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,680
That's right.

600
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,520
Anyway, because of Dong-cheol,

601
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,790
his son's paralyzed from the waist down.

602
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,890
If you go ahead and testify in favor
of Dong-cheol before the election,

603
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,890
I could possibly lose this election.

604
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,830
Do you really want to be
elected that badly?

605
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,000
Sang-hwan.

606
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,400
I want to be re-elected
as the governor

607
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,070
not only for my sake.

608
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,470
This is also for your mother.

609
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,510
If I become the governor,
I'm sure

610
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,510
your mother will get well again.

611
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:20,110
Then our family will be able to go
back to how we used to be.

612
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,780
Isn't that what you want as well?

613
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,090
Governor.

614
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,720
Everything's ready.

615
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,170
You all shouldn't have gone through
the trouble to come all this way.

616
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,930
According to the hospital,

617
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,140
you made visits to see your wife
every single day. Is that true?

618
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,940
I'm sure you're busy
preparing for the election.

619
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,840
Aren't you worried this might affect
your campaign?

620
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,590
My wife

621
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,560
is the most important person in my
life. I love her dearly.

622
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,000
As much as I love my wife,

623
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,660
there's not a day that goes by

624
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,030
without promising myself to love
and cherish the people of Muji.

625
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,880
Mr. Im.

626
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,320
I told you to take some time off.
What are you doing here?

627
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,520
It's all right, sir.

628
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,860
I feel much better today.

629
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,330
Is your wife still bedridden?

630
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,160
Yes.

631
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,070
I'm sure there are no words to
explain how much pain you're in.

632
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,900
How's your daughter doing? Has
she returned to school?

633
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,010
No, she's still at home.

634
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,280
My wife's not doing so well.

635
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,910
It's as if the world is coming to
an end.

636
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,780
Pardon?

637
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:07,820
Those jerks are going to school
like nothing ever happened.

638
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,590
And they're eating nice, warm meals
that their parents cooked for them.

639
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,930
Sir, what do you mean?

640
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,490
How could they be going to school?

641
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,200
They're not at the police station
anymore.

642
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,170
That can't be.

643
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:25,000
My son died because of them.

644
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,540
I guess you didn't know because you
were busy with your son's funeral.

645
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,310
Pardon?

646
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,950
Did you not hear anything
from the police station?

647
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,310
No.

648
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,850
Every single one of them
got acquitted.

649
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,420
Their parents have a lot of power
over our county.

650
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,890
This is a very small town.
It's very different from Seoul.

(JUNGBU DETENTION CENTER)

652
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,440
My goodness, look at how skinny
you've become.

653
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,180
Dong-cheol, are you okay?

654
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,890
I think he's a bit busy because of
his dad's election.

655
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,720
Tomorrow's the day of your trial, right?

656
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,060
I'm sure nothing will happen.

657
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,160
Sang-hwan witnessed everything.

658
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,560
So everything will be okay
if he testifies what he saw.

659
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,060
Don't worry.

660
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,500
Dong-cheol, we put in some money
under your name,

661
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,540
so just buy whatever
you want to eat.

662
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,000
You guys don't have money.

663
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,740
Just hurry up and pay back
everything you bought on credit.

664
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,540
Gosh, don't worry.

665
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,410
I'm going to pay everything back
once I earn from the online videos.

666
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,350
(Sang-hwan, you're going to come to
Dong-cheol's trial, right?)

667
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,490
(We'll wait for you
at the side gate.)

668
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:04,700
Excuse me.

669
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:08,110
Do you know where
K Karaoke Room is?

670
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,240
-K Karaoke Room? It's over there.
-K Karaoke Room?

00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,640
Sang-jin.

673
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,710
I promise.

674
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,580
I promise I'll take your
revenge on them.

(Hey, Sang-hwan. Why aren't you
answering your phone?)

677
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,610
(Is something going on?)

678
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,350
(Dong-cheol won't be safe
at this rate.)

679
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,920
(You and Dong-cheol are best friends.)

680
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,160
Dong-cheol.

681
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,960
Please sit here.

(DEFENDANT'S SEAT)

683
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,500
What's going to happen to
Dong-cheol? Where's Sang-hwan?

684
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,840
I'm sure he'll come.

685
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,110
Isn't he answering his phone?

686
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,220
Let's go now.

687
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,590
You jerk.

688
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,340
Gosh, stop.

689
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,410
Let go of me!

690
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,340
He doesn't

691
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,210
look okay.

692
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,780
What?

693
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,350
Is he dead?

694
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,050
Why did you have to go this far?

695
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,290
Would you be able to stay calm if
a guy comes after you to kill you

696
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,020
with a hammer in his hand?

697
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:15,130
He's right.
It was just self-defense.

698
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,470
Whatever.

699
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,330
I'm going to go.

What do you mean?

715
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,850
I can't do anything for you guys

716
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,320
because I'm incompetent.

717
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,530
That's not true, Dad.

718
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,070
I feel so reassured because
I have you.

You're no one other than yourself.

You should know that you've

731

never reminded me of your father.
