00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,960
(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
(EPISODE 12)

3
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,840
Mom.

4
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,280
Is it you, Sang-jin?

5
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,880
Sang-jin!

6
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,520
Where do you think you're going?
Let's have some fun.

7
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,960
Don't you know that you'll never
be able to get out of here?

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,459
Sang-jin! Sang-jin.

9
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,360
-Help me, Sang-jin!
-Mom!

10
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,360
Sang-jin.

11
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,730
You need to get out of here
for Sang-mi to live,

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,300
so please...

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,840
Please save Sang-mi.

14
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,810
Sang-mi!

15
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,509
No, Sang-mi.

16
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,710
Is it you, Sang-mi?

17
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,150
Sang-mi, get out of here now.
Sang-mi...

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,150
You are...

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,160
Don't come closer.

20
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,230
Where is Sang-mi?

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,930
It looks like the drugs have worn off.

22
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,040
What kind of drugs

23
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,110
have you been dosing me up with?

24
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,340
The drug that will allow you
to stay in the paradise forever.

25
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,720
Here, let's go back inside now.

26
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,250
What are you

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,660
trying to do to Sang-mi?

28
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,260
What do you mean?

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,730
We're just trying to help Sang-mi
get on the Boat of Salvation first.

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,230
Do you know how blessed she is
to be in that position?

31
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,600
Why on earth

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,240
are you doing this to us? Why?

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,410
You still don't see it.

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,920
I have to make Sang-mi
our Spiritual Mother

35
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,690
so that my daughter and I can
reach the paradise.

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
Sang-mi.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,060
Sang-mi, run...

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,170
Sang-mi.

39
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,100
Run... Run away.

40
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,210
Sang-mi...

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,640
-Is it for yourself?
-I want to give it to my mom.

42
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,750
Oh, it's for your mom.

43
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
My mom

44
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,019
has never been outside of
that place for three years.

45
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,930
She has always liked butterflies.

46
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,810
Do you know what this is?

47
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,810
People normally call it
elephant injection.

48
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,480
It's a tranquilizer that can
even knock down an elephant

49
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,450
with just one shot.

50
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,700
Don't worry.

51
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,000
I won't inject too much of it.

52
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,000
Sang-jin...

53
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,610
That's right.

54
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,680
Get some rest.

55
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,150
You're in the paradise now.

56
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,240
Mom!

57
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,920
What are you doing to my mom?

58
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,150
Can't you see?

59
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,120
Your mother's condition

60
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,020
has gotten worse because of you.

61
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,760
Because you're not taking
the training faithfully,

62
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,270
the evil has gone inside
your mother's body

63
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,700
to disturb your mind.

64
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,570
If you want her to be healthy,

65
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,510
you have to take the training
with all your heart.

66
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,180
Stop talking nonsense--

67
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,409
If you don't,

68
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,080
we will perform an exorcism on her.
Would you like that?

69
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,040
I am

70
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,710
sorry, Apostle Kang.

71
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,320
What are you sorry for?

72
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,020
Everything.

73
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,850
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,060
I really am sorry for everything.

75
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,500
So please,

76
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,730
let my mom go.

77
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,400
You know that

78
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,440
I want her to be happy
more than anyone in this place.

79
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,310
So trust me, okay?

80
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,050
Okay.

81
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,680
I'll trust you.

82
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,890
I trust you, Apostle Kang.

83
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,460
All right.

84
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,790
Shall we go back
to the prayer room now?

85
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,030
Please wait.

86
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,930
I'd like to stay with my mom
just for a little.

87
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,070
Please, Apostle Kang.

88
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,510
I'll wait for you outside.

89
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,320
Mom.

90
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,490
Hang in there a little longer.

91
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,290
Just a little longer.

92
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,730
Please hang in there a little longer.

93
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,170
Okay?

94
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,130
Don't you ever give up.

95
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,440
So-rin,

96
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,440
you shouldn't let Sang-mi
go around by herself.

97
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,550
Take better care of her.

98
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,220
Okay.

99
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,060
(GUSEONWON)

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,500
It looks like things are a little
different from yesterday.

101
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,210
We're having an exorcism service today.

102
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,080
An exorcism service?

103
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,340
Yes. You might not know this,

104
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,820
but we're having spiritual battles
with the evil every day.

105
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,890
Illnesses, misfortunes,

106
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,860
and accidents happen

107
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,790
because our souls
are captured by the evil.

108
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,900
Now, apostles,
please help her come forward.

109
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,970
Please be careful.

110
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,150
She's possessed by the evil.

111
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,320
Who are you?

112
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,330
I'm her father-in-law.

113
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,830
She is a child of Almighty.
How did you get inside of her?

114
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,770
I got inside of her
when her faith was weakened.

115
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,610
Go away! Go away now,
and take her sickness with you!

116
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,870
I won't.

117
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,580
I will kill everyone.

118
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,620
Almighty saved her life, didn't he?

119
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,590
So why would I go?

120
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,860
You caught me.

121
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,570
I just need to stay inside of her
a little longer.

122
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,700
You evil soul!

123
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,710
Here, I curse you.

124
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,180
Go away with her bad sickness at once!

125
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,290
My goodness.

126
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,890
-Oh, gosh.
-Goodness.

127
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,330
-She's alive.
-She's getting up.

128
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,900
Spiritual Father.
I'm no longer in pain.

129
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,630
I don't feel any pain.

130
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,210
Power, miracles, salvation,
and eternal life.

131
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,110
I shall give all of these

132
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,980
to those who believe in me!

133
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,150
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

134
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,320
-I believe it!
-I believe it!

135
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,990
They're crazy.

136
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,190
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

137
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,260
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

138
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,030
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

139
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,670
How was today's service?

140
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,200
It was amazing.
I didn't think ghosts exist.

141
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,610
You can believe it
now that you've seen it, right?

142
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,840
See?

143
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,350
Guseonwon is different from
other churches.

144
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,810
You can see everything here.

145
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,690
We're totally different from
churches that tell you to believe

146
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,320
something you can't even see.

147
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,720
By the way

148
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,090
Yes? Is there something you want to ask?

149
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,630
When will we get to meet Spiritual Father?

150
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,870
You must've been very impressed
by our Spiritual Father today.

151
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,470
If you want to see
our Spiritual Father in person,

152
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,110
you need to receive the basic
training process as a believer.

153
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,980
Can't we just meet him right now?

154
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,350
Dong-cheol.

155
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,450
Do you want to lose your eyesight?

156
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,320
-Pardon?
-He's a very special being.

157
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,860
If people like you who are
spiritually weak meet him up close,

158
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,390
you might end up losing
your eyesight

159
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,960
because of the strong energy he lets out.

160
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,870
Then what do we need to do?

161
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,230
You need to live here

162
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,440
and receive the basic training process
for three weeks.

163
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,840
We need to live here?

164
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,980
That's how you'll be able to cleanse
your body and soul.

165
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,850
Do we need to pay money
while we receive training?

166
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,790
You'll be sleeping, eating,
and receiving training for free.

167
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,120
However, you need to make
an offering to our Almighty later on

168
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,730
for the entry and completion
of your training process.

169
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,760
How much is that?

170
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,070
It's not that expensive.
It costs 1,000 dollars each.

171
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,030
You mean 2,000 dollars?

172
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,700
What? 2,000 dollars?

173
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,110
Everyone.

174
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,540
Will you choose to have eternal life
in paradise

175
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,040
by receiving training for three weeks?

176
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,180
Or will you choose to live
in eternal pain in the fiery pit

177
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,950
just by saving 2,000 dollars?

178
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,990
Shall we go to the seminar room now?
Let's go.

179
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,120
Wait.

180
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,330
Yes? Do you have another question?

181
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,800
I need to go to the bathroom.

182
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,530
Oh, I see. Yes, you should go.

183
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,700
You can come to the seminar room
after you're done.

184
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,840
Okay.

185
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,420
(INDIVIDUAL PRAYER ROOM)

186
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,190
Sang-mi told you not to worry.

187
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,190
She's in the individual prayer room,
so you can't meet her yet.

188
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,760
But you'll be able to meet her soon.

189
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,540
(INDIVIDUAL PRAYER ROOM)

190
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,420
What are you doing there?

191
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:10,390
I heard a weird sound
coming from this room

192
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,190
after I came out of the bathroom.

193
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,369
It's not a weird sound.

194
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,480
It's the sound of our believers
crying in pain

195
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,950
from deep down within their hearts.

196
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,520
Oh, I see.

197
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,990
The world

198
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,190
does not listen to those people
in pain these days.

199
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,100
They only listen to those
who are rich and powerful.

200
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,070
However, it seems like you
have a lot of anger and despair

201
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,340
deep down in your heart.

202
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,310
You carried all that burden
to finally come here.

203
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,420
I can only imagine how painful
and torturous it must've been.

204
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,630
It's burning hot.

205
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,600
If you keep neglecting all the resentment
and sorrow in your heart,

206
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,610
you'll end up burning yourself

207
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,510
as well as everything around you.

208
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,910
So now, you should

209
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,280
surrender everything to Almighty.

210
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,020
That's the only way
you'll be able to free your soul.

211
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,670
What do I need to do?

212
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,000
What should I do

213
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,210
to surrender my everything
to Almighty?

214
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,050
Pray to Almighty.

215
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,920
After all, this is where people pray.

216
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,790
However, this place is not open
to all believers.

217
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,130
So you should leave with me today.

218
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,060
Okay.

219
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,030
(I want you to catch those jerks.)

220
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,470
(You know I can't just
let go of things, right?)

221
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,240
Welcome.

222
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,500
What What was that?

223
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,300
Was that a bear or human?

224
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,700
Keep your promise, and restart
the citizens' long-desired business.

225
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,640
-Keep your promise!
-Keep your promise!

226
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,570
Don't disturb Muji's development.

227
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
-Don't disturb Muji's development.
-Yes, okay.

228
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,180
-Keep your promise!
-There are more protesters now.

229
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,910
-Keep your promise!
-Keep your promise!

230
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,550
-Don't disturb Muji's development.
-The press have gathered too.

231
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,780
-Don't disturb Muji's development.
-Don't disturb Muji's development.

232
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,920
The governor of Muji
should keep his promise!

233
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,390
Are they still protesting?

234
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,930
More and more people are taking
part in the protest.

235
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,830
The press also seems to be
taking the other party's side now.

236
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,400
Things are going as Mr. Cheon planned.

237
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,210
People are going against you
for no good reason.

238
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,610
You can't just continue to do nothing
and watch them from afar.

239
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,610
There's a way you can get
rid of Mr. Cheon,

240
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,580
and make the terminal business
into your own achievement.

241
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,590
You should hold hands with
Baek Jeong-gi.

242
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,390
I've looked into Guseonwon's offer,

243
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,760
and it's pretty appealing.

244
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,000
It's also something our citizens
have been wanting for a long time.

245
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,800
A general hospital with a sanitarium?

246
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,500
If we shorten the construction process

247
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,000
and successfully build it
within your term,

248
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,170
it'll work positively for you
during the next election.

249
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,640
And if you succeed in using
Baek Jeong-gi wisely,

250
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,710
you'll also be able to move Senator Park.

251
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,350
Really?

252
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,580
Ji-hui.

253
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,590
Then why don't you fix a schedule?

254
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,120
I should go and see for myself

255
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,190
what kind of place Guseonwon is.

256
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,930
Okay.

257
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,410
Flowers tend to wither
when their lives end.

258
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,720
But you are very tenacious of life.

259
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,790
Do you know why I take care of you?

260
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,930
It's because you're a flower to me.

261
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,700
You're a flower that I can
show off to others.

262
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,340
You're still worth the use.

263
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,640
So please stay dead like this
until I'm done using you.

264
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,850
I'll come visit you every day

265
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,080
to water you.

266
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,400
What's going on?

267
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,310
Apostle Kang gave my mom an injection.

268
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,640
-What?
-I'm sure of it.

269
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,180
I saw her hiding the syringe
that was in her hand.

270
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,850
Okay, I'll look into what
that could've been.

271
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,220
And I think...

272
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,360
It's okay. Please tell me.

273
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,130
I think

274
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,540
your mother's condition got worse
because of her medicine.

275
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,270
What kind of medicine did she take?

276
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I'm still looking into it.

277
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
But I think it was a psychotropic drug.

278
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,120
It's just a guess, but it could've
been given to other people as well.

279
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,620
If we confirm that they injected
unidentified medicine illegally,

280
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,220
they will be subject to legal punishment.

281
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,090
Legal punishment?

282
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,270
I'll try asking my friends for help.

283
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,800
It'll be quicker if we all
look for evidence together.

284
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,300
Please help me get in touch
with Dong-cheol.

285
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,810
Okay. It might be easier for him
to look around since he's a newcomer.

286
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,810
However, a lot of believers
have their eyes on us.

287
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,860
Evidence? Do I need to look for
forged medical prescriptions

288
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,730
or strange drugs?

289
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,460
Drug ledgers and medical charts
will help too.

290
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,470
It's a special kind of drug,
so it'll be hidden somewhere.

291
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,930
They're not red pills or clear liquid.

292
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,200
Please look for a container
with milk-like liquid.

293
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,570
Milk-like liquid?

294
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,270
She said they're not red pills.

295
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,980
Where were you? I couldn't even
find you in the prayer room.

296
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,880
I couldn't concentrate,
so I took a look around.

297
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,620
It must've cost a lot of money
to build such a huge building

298
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,920
in the mountain.

299
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,860
How much did it cost?

300
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
My gosh.

301
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,730
You sometimes seem very odd.

302
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,370
Don't think about useless things.
Just focus on receiving salvation.

303
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,410
-My goodness.
-Okay.

304
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,810
-Get in. You need to go back.
-Okay.

305
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,400
-Dong-cheol.
-Yes.

306
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
(GUSEONWON)

307
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,320
(Where are you?)

308
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,370
Aren't you hot?

309
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,810
It's cold because there are
air conditioners everywhere I go.

310
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,210
It's not good to be around
air conditioners for too long.

311
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,980
Cold drinks aren't good for your body.

312
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,520
You always had weak intestines.

313
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,790
This is why it's great to have friends.

314
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,730
Friends know everything about you.

315
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,230
You don't need to sit down.

316
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,240
I guess you're still quite dumb.

317
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,750
There are rumors saying that

318
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,020
you're working for a policeman.

319
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,090
I can't believe you're working
for the police now.

320
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,290
I'm surprised.

321
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,390
The world we live in
revolves around money.

322
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,830
Then

323
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,170
shouldn't you work for someone
who's stronger than

324
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,430
that policeman?

325
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,980
I'll put in a good word for you
to my boss.

326
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,940
So let's work together.

327
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,380
Let's forget about the past.

328
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,180
We're

329
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,850
over 40 now.

330
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,050
That policeman and my boss

331
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,290
are fighting for their own goods.

332
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,830
But that doesn't mean we have to
fight each other as well.

333
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,030
Let's just earn our share of money
from their fights.

334
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,410
Hey.

335
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,540
From now on,

336
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,680
I'll give you 30 percent of
what I earn from the club.

337
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,450
Let's work together like old times

338
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,450
and take over Muji.

339
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,590
What does a human being mean to you?

340
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,030
-What?
-Do you think of humans as objects?

341
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,700
You're trying to get me on your side
by saying what I want to hear.

342
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,940
But are you going to abandon me
again when you don't need me?

343
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,840
What happened to you in prison?

344
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,510
Why have you become so complicated?

345
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,450
Do you know why

346
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,750
I haven't killed you yet?

347
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,290
Why? Tell me.

348
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,290
I'm trying to make you nervous.

349
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,890
So

350
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,560
you should start going to church.

351
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,230
You should at least

352
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,530
go to paradise when you die.

353
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,350
I met

354
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,690
the cult leader today.

355
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,490
Really?

356
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,490
What happened?

357
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,160
When his hand touched my body,

358
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,700
I seriously couldn't move an inch.

359
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,040
I met

360
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,940
so many monsters in prison.

361
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,540
But I've never met anyone like him.

362
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,050
I couldn't feel any kinds of
emotion in him.

363
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,020
So I couldn't figure out

364
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,620
what he was thinking

365
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,120
or what he was feeling.

366
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
Yes.

367
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,460
When I also sneaked into his room,

368
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,460
I could sense that

369
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,100
he was beyond insane
judging by his actions.

370
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,830
Sang-hwan.

371
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,640
When I saw the look in that
cult leader's eyes,

372
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,710
this is what came to my mind.

373
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,080
I thought I was the only one who had
to suffer in prison for three years.

374
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,050
But I realized that

375
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,450
Sang-mi had been living in prison too.

376
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,030
The same goes for you as well.

377
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,130
So

378
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,070
it's now time for you and Sang-mi

379
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,240
to get out of that prison.

380
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,820
We never know when Almighty might
come to save us.

381
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,750
So we always need to stay
as a pure virgin with an awakened soul.

382
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,320
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

383
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,320
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

384
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,930
Hence, this early morning time
is very important to us.

385
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,430
When others are foolishly asleep,

386
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,070
we must stay awake to prepare
for the day Almighty will be here.

387
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,610
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

388
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,240
From now on, you should come here
every day at this hour

389
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,080
and pray earnestly.

390
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,280
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

391
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:11,280
I'm sure that Almighty will gift you
with an astonishing revelation.

392
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,790
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

393
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,720
Good.

394
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,060
Go in, and begin your prayer
with all of your heart.

395
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,170
Okay, Apostle Kang.

396
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,080
Hello.

397
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,750
This is the one
who found the body.

398
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,750
He's Park Seung-man, and he runs
a health food store downtown.

399
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,860
He has superb eyesight,
which helps him find ginseng.

400
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,130
Who knew he'd find a dead body too?

401
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,560
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

402
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,230
-Get his statement.
-Sure.

403
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,230
Sir, please come with me.

404
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,800
Did you guys find anything on the scene?

405
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,740
Oh, we found a wallet
right beside the body.

406
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,170
There was a social security card inside.

407
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,040
Officer Choi, show it to him.

408
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,409
Here you go, sir.

409
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,449
(KIM HYE-EUN)

410
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,260
(KIM HYE-EUN, AGE 18,
RELIGION, RAN AWAY FROM HOME)

411
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,389
Please find my granddaughter.

412
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,730
I'll look into it
and be in touch with you.

413
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What's the matter?

414
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,100
Sorry?

415
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,670
It's nothing. Never mind.

416
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,420
Hey.

417
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,820
What's that building over there?

418
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,960
Oh, it's Guseonwon.

419
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,260
-Guseonwon?
-Yes.

420
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,830
They locked her up because they want her
to marry the cult leader.

421
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,760
We wouldn't have come here
if we could talk to them!

422
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,800
-Detective Kim, take this guy.
-Yes, sir.

423
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,600
Stop, please!

424
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,270
I'll go back.

425
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,010
I'll go back to Guseonwon,
so please let them go.

426
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:43,300
(GUSEONWON)

427
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,280
Excuse me. What is that?

428
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,760
-Living Water.
-Living Water?

429
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,290
Even those who are bedridden
with a terminal illness

430
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,100
get up and laugh
when they drink this water.

431
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,170
-Just drinking this isn't enough.
-Right.

432
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,600
You have to have faith in it.

433
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,770
Yes, absolutely.

434
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,010
By the way, why is the color
of your lid gold?

435
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,880
This is special Living Water blessed
by Spiritual Father's face.

436
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,150
Blessed by his face?

437
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,420
Spiritual Father washed his face
with this water.

438
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,450
And you sprinkle it on your food?

439
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,190
I guess you don't know these things
because you're new.

440
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,860
It's considered the most
precious Living Water.

441
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,400
It's priceless.

442
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,800
Then what's yours?

443
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,040
Spiritual Father washed
his feet with this water.

444
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,640
Water that touched his body
and received his blessings

445
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,110
is the most precious water of all.

446
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,210
Absolutely.

447
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,110
Well, I'm not saying
that we can't punish them.

448
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,820
Cornering them won't do you any good
because they'll take action.

449
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,190
Chief.

450
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,690
Those jerks abducted my daughter.

451
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,220
They'll take action?
What does that even mean?

452
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,860
Your daughter stated that
she wanted them to take her,

453
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,730
so it can't be considered an abduction.

454
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,930
Also,

455
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,400
it looked like those guys got assaulted.

456
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,100
That I can explain. We were
on our way to a morning service,

457
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,740
and they blocked our car
out of the blue.

458
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,210
Then they tried to take Sang-mi
from us forcibly,

459
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,940
so we punched them a few times
to try to stop them.

460
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,410
There's one more thing.

461
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,520
We heard that she was locked up here.

462
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,020
What are you talking about?

463
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,460
Detective, you're out of line.

464
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,930
We never locked up anyone.
Everyone here came here at their own will.

465
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,230
They're here to cure their souls.
You're calling it confinement

466
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,530
because you don't understand
our religion, and it's very rude.

467
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,000
Right, I do apologize.

468
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,940
But there are a few things
I'd like to check.

469
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,910
Would I be able to meet the pastor here?

470
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,710
We call him Spiritual Father,
not "pastor".

471
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Pardon me?

472
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,450
Isn't this a church?

473
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,120
I see a cross there too.

474
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,920
This place is different from the churches

475
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,720
that you know of.

476
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,190
Other churches are all fake.

477
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,860
Only we worship the truth.

478
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,960
I see.

479
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,170
Then may I meet your pastor...

480
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,900
I mean, would I be able to meet
Spiritual Father for a quick talk?

481
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,970
Chief, you're so clueless.

482
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,180
Lowlifes can't have the honor to meet him

483
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,780
even if they want to.

484
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,280
What did you say? Look, Mister.

485
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,680
Did you just call me a lowlife?

486
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,350
Please don't cause a scene here.
Let's talk in my office.

487
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,990
You came to Almighty's sanctuary,

488
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,660
so I should at least bring out some
tea for you. That's true love.

489
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,840
I'm Chief Lee Gang-su
from the Serious Crimes Unit.

490
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,400
As you know, there was the abduction case,

491
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,710
and something else broke out
around here yesterday,

492
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,240
so I'd like to ask you a few questions.

493
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,210
Sure, please go ahead.

494
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,850
About that girl, Sang-mi.

495
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,180
Have you ever demanded
sexual relations from her?

496
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,550
Of course not.

497
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,720
According to her, she was told
that she has to marry you.

498
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,730
When Almighty's world is strictly seen
from the worldly point of view,

499
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,830
such misunderstandings
can certainly arise.

500
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,300
Pardon me?

501
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,500
The spiritual wedding is

502
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,610
a wedding in a symbolic sense
where two souls become one.

503
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,810
It's a ritual that aims
to achieve a spiritual cohesion.

504
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,680
Well, what I'm trying to say is...

505
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,750
I'm not here to talk
about your religious doctrine.

506
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:51,080
Does your so-called
"spiritual wedding" involve

507
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,050
any sexual aspect?
That was my question.

508
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,890
You keep approaching it
in the worldly point of view.

509
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,560
Gosh, you're at it again.
You're making it sound so complicated.

510
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,030
Chief, I'm her father.

511
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,870
What father will force his daughter
to have sexual relations?

512
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,670
No parents in their right mind
would do such a thing.

513
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,380
I don't think you're understanding
my question clearly.

514
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,650
What I'm asking is
if the spiritual wedding

515
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,050
You said it's a ritual
where two souls seek a spiritual cohesion.

516
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,520
I'm asking if having sexual relations
is a mandatory part of it.

517
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,190
Chief, it doesn't look like
you want to believe

518
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,160
what we're telling you.

519
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,430
Apostle Kang.

520
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,670
Yes, she'll be here shortly.

521
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,670
You should ask her directly.

522
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,190
Your dad, Sipritual Father,
and these apostles are saying

523
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,890
that you were never confined
or coerced in any way. Is it true?

524
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,130
Don't worry, and tell me honestly.

525
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,970
Yes, such things never happened.

526
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,400
This isn't the kind of place
you think it is.

527
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,010
-Last time I saw you, you said--
-That day, I was a bit

528
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,840
I wasn't really myself that day.

529
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,910
You saw my medical report too.

530
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,550
I'm suffering from depression.

531
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,550
It's because she still needs
to work on her faith.

532
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,020
She's my daughter.

533
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,560
Think about it. What father doesn't know
how his daughter feels?

534
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,230
Spiritual Father, the afternoon service
will start shortly.

535
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,300
Shall I delay it a little?

536
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,030
No, there's no need.

537
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,300
Our believers came
all the way here for it.

538
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,340
I cannot make them wait.

539
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,170
Detective.

540
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,310
Please excuse me.

541
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,550
-Okay, then one last question--
-That's enough.

542
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,220
I know that you're a cop,
but this is out of line.

543
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,450
I mean, it's not like we're criminals.

544
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,560
We live in a country where everyone
has the freedom of religion.

545
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,560
Aren't I right?

546
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,700
Why did you just laugh?

547
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,430
Well, you know.

548
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,700
You said exactly what I was
expecting to hear.

549
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,070
Sorry?

550
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,070
I was wondering when you would
bring it up, and you finally did.

551
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,340
The freedom of religion.

552
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,810
Well, I'll get going then.

553
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,060
Sang-hwan, Sang-hwan!
Come over here quickly.

554
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,990
-What's going on?
-We have big news.

555
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,960
-We uploaded a video, you know.
-Right.

556
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,770
Someone posted a photo
after seeing the cross in the video.

557
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,940
Have a look at this.

558
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,500
Isn't it exactly the same?

559
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,010
Hey, do you know where this is?

560
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,940
I've been messaging the person
who posted this, but no reply yet.

561
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,210
There's no phone number either.

562
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,550
Hey, can you zoom in on that thing?

563
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,550
This?

564
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,050
(DAEGU EXPRESS,
MOVING AND DELIVERY SERVICES)

565
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,460
Does that mean it's Daegu?

566
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,260
Should we try to find her?

567
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,400
Hey,
Daegu isn't a tiny country town.

568
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,000
And it's not like we're deliverymen.

569
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,000
There's Pil-su.

570
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,180
Our believers won't appreciate that.

571
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,820
Sorry.

572
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:51,260
And if you happen
to see those young men again,

573
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,760
please pass along my message to them.

574
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,930
Sure, what is it?

575
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,600
Please let them know that
I'd really like to meet them again.

576
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,570
We need to clear up
the misunderstandings.

577
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,960
Sir.

578
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,390
-Nice to meet you.
-It's an honor to meet you.

579
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,600
-Let's go in.
-Sure.

580
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,670
What on earth

581
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,570
are you guys up to?

582
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,450
-Chief.
-What did they say?

583
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,920
They said that she and
her grandmother fought a lot

584
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,490
about money before she ran away from home.

585
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,500
-Money?
-She said to her grandmother

586
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,600
that she has to go to the paradise
or whatever it's called

587
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,700
and begged for 2,000 dollars,
but her grandmother said no.

588
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,640
Then she yelled at her grandmother
calling her a demon and stormed out.

589
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,950
Oh, Chief. Where are you going?

590
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,150
Let's go out for soju.
It's been too long.

591
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,420
Go home early,
and tend to your family.

592
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,990
Sorry?

(QUESTIONS ABOUT SALVATION)

594
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,900
You all got the questionnaire, right?

595
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,160
-Yes.
-Yes.

596
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,700
If you can't answer "yes" to
all the questions with conviction,

597
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,900
you won't be able to get
on the Boat of Salvation.

598
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,910
All right then.
Who wants to answer the questions?

599
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,510
Dong-cheol?

600
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,550
Me?

601
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,310
Apostle Kang, are you inside?

602
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,980
Do you know and firmly believe that
your name is in the Book of Life?

603
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,820
Oh, the Book of Life...

604
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,620
No.

605
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,220
Do you believe that Almighty is alive?

606
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,230
No.

607
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,600
The rest of you should answer
the questions in your head too.

608
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,100
Do you trust that you'll get on
the Boat of Salvation?

609
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,270
No.

610
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,170
Do you believe Spiritual Father
to be your parent spiritually?

611
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,810
No, not yet.

612
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,580
How many questions
did you answer "no" to?

613
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,250
I don't think I said "yes" to anything.

614
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,720
What about you guys?

615
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:47,260
Then none of you
will be able to reach the paradise.

616
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,900
Do you all want to end up
in the fiery pit?

617
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,170
I'll show you the difference between
the paradise and the fiery pit.

618
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,270
Let's watch a video about it.

619
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,370
Sister, please play the video.

620
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,220
I learned this skill
from senior reporters.

621
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,390
Now, you need to desert
all worldly things.

622
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,840
That's right.

623
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,110
-Gosh!
-My gosh.

624
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,410
Mr. Han,
I didn't expect to see you here.

625
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,180
Senator Park, it's been a long time.

626
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,550
-You made it.
-Yes.

627
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,280
-Please have a seat.
-Sure.

628
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,960
I heard from Spiritual Father

629
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,960
that you've been chosen by Almighty.

630
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,690
I'm flattered.

631
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,500
Almighty loves you very much, Mr. Han.

632
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:22,270
My gosh, is that so?

633
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,610
Everyone at Guseonwon is working
so hard to improve our community.

634
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:30,910
As a governor of Muji-gun,
I must help them, don't you think?

635
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,710
Of course. Now that you've become
our fellow believer,

636
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,650
Muji-gun will become
an even better place to live.

637
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,150
Gosh, I'm flattered.

638
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,330
Guys, drink up.

639
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,200
-You!
-Yes.

640
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,470
How many years have I been devoted
to the delivery industry?

641
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,000
Well...

642
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,140
You got into the industry in middle
school, so it's been over 20 years.

643
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,340
What about me?

644
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,140
You're as experienced as he is.

645
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,280
With my delivery bag alone,

646
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,880
I've worked at all
Chinese restaurants in Daegu.

647
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,080
Same here.

648
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,720
Well, we're wondering if you can
take a look at this photo.

649
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,160
Sang-hwan.

650
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:21,990
There's always a right time
for everything, okay?

651
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,200
Got it.

652
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,140
Goodness, this beer is so bland.

653
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,610
Let me see.

654
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,210
Oh, he's carrying the delivery bag
in his left hand.

655
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:45,880
Look at this angle as he's making a turn.
He sure is a pro.

656
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,760
A lefty who's a pro.
There aren't many guys that are like that.

657
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,490
-Would it be Forehead?
-He retired last year.

658
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,830
-Why?
-He hurt a disc on his wrist.

659
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,960
Seriously? My goodness,
he's not even 30 yet.

660
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,670
Hey, can this guy be--

661
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,370
You idiots are wasting
all your time here.

662
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,640
Gosh, ma'am.
What's your problem now?

663
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,340
Ma'am? You're only
a few years younger than me.

664
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,780
You're right, miss.
Please calm down.

665
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,380
My bad.

666
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,280
I didn't say anything.

667
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,780
Will you guys drive your scooter drunk?

668
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,090
Gosh, I'm done for the day.

669
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,250
Me too.

670
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,520
Is that right?

671
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,060
Then order some food!

672
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,830
Munch on squid or something, you punks!

673
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:29,960
-Gosh, wait. It hurts!
-Let go!

674
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,230
How can you be so strong? Goodness.

675
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,930
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

676
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,770
Goodness gracious.

677
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,780
If you order ever again, I'll make sure
your noodles are all sodden.

678
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,510
Gosh, that woman has such
a nasty temper. Unbelievable.

679
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,920
By the way, weren't you going
to say something to us?

680
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,490
Oh, right.
I think that guy is Cheetah.

681
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,590
Cheetah?

682
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,260
-Yes! It's Cheetah.
-Right?

683
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,700
I heard from other guys
that he works in Daegu now.

684
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,460
I knew it.

685
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,930
You're sure, right?

686
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:12,500
Sang-hwan, I've been in this line
of work for two decades.

687
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,040
Of course I'm sure.

688
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,160
I heard you wanted to see me.

689
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,550
Come closer.

690
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,920
Only believe

691
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,200
in Almighty and pray.

692
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,900
Empty your mind of everything.

693
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:23,740
Are you ready to accept Almighty
with all of your heart?

694
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,090
Why did you

695
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,320
choose me as Spiritual Mother?

696
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,960
You've been chosen to atone
for all of our sins on our behalf,

697
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,570
and it was Almighty's choice.

698
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,070
That's not what I was asking.
Tell me the real reason.

699
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,770
Why did it have to be me?

700
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,670
Why my dad?

701
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,340
Why my mom?

702
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,850
Why did it have to be my family?

703
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,650
It's all

704
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,290
part of Almighty's plan.

705
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,420
You know

706
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,990
that I'm not sincerely obeying you now.

707
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,330
I'm only doing this to protect my mom,
and you know it.

708
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,140
Why are you doing this to me?

709
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,470
What is the real reason?

710
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,640
Sang-mi,

711
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,620
you don't believe in me
even though I'm Spiritual Father.

712
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,690
All right.

713
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,160
A long time ago,

714
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:55,730
there was a female volunteer
who used to visit my place.

715
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,240
She had such a pure soul,

716
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,670
and she was very pretty too.

717
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,780
But I guess I was

718
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,420
too impatient back then.

719
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,420
Fruit has to ripen

720
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,430
to taste sweeter

721
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,400
and more delicious.

722
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,300
One day, I heard

723
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,010
that she jumped to her death
from the rooftop at her school.

724
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,610
It was very sad.

725
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,010
All I wanted was

726
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,890
to teach her the secret
to salvation.

727
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:56,960
That's why I thought this
when I first saw you.

728
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,600
"This time,"

729
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,400
"I must not fail."

730
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,680
Now,

731
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:18,250
do you understand the real reason
why I chose you?

732
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,800
You have nowhere to run.

733
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,270
If you step back, you'll be
standing on the edge of a cliff.

734
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:49,750
Try all you want,

735
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,850
and scream for help.

736
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,090
Here, there's only one person
who can save you.

737
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,790
Me.

738
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,430
There's no one else.

739
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,080
Are you saying

740
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,710
you're doing all this because
I look like the girl you killed?

741
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:26,150
Is that why you chose me
and my family?

742
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,390
If you keep this up,

743
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:37,700
I might have to change my ways.

744
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,650
(SAVE ME)

745
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,560
Hey.

746
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,490
Get up already.

747
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,730
I...

748
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,770
I don't like you, Chief.

749
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,470
I don't even trust you

750
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,300
because of what happened
with Dong-cheol three years back

751
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:21,540
and how you made Sang-mi
go back there a while ago.

752
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,510
But I need your help now.

753
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,280
Right now, I need someone
who has investigative authority,

754
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,690
so I really need you.
