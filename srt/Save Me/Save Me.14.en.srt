Who are you?

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,480
You jerks made my mom get all bruised,

5
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,180
saying that you're giving her a prayer.

6
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,880
You guys need to pay for what you did.

7
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,420
Hey, stop--

8
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,430
Stop that immediately!

9
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,170
Sang-mi. Get out of here.

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Dad.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,140
Don't worry.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,810
Almighty will protect me.

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,280
All right. Let's see
if he will really protect you.

14
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,080
We shall find out.

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Get out of here with Spiritual Mother!

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,860
-Let's go.
-Now!

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,030
Hurry.

18
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
What? Why are you here?

19
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,100
Are you one of them?

20
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,370
Sang-mi, we must hurry.

21
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,050
Listen to me carefully now.

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm not one of them.

23
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,580
I just want to kill everyone here.

24
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,250
What? Why are you stopping me then?

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
Didn't you say

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,120
you want to make a lot of money and
live with your mom in a nice place?

27
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,000
I will

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,500
destroy this place no matter what.

29
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,010

-Hurry.

36
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,790
Goodness! Hey!

37
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,990
-Are you okay? My gosh.
-Are you all right?

38
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,560
Come on.

39
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm okay.

40
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,610
Dong-cheol.

41
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,110
I thought you were slow-witted,
but you're quite manly.

42
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,010
I just thought I had to protect
Spiritual Mother.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,650
What made you think that?

44
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,990
I was told that she will cleanse us
of our original sin.

45
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,490
Isn't it right?

46
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,730
You have such a pure soul.

47
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:27,140
Almighty will make great use of you.

48
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,620
How did it go with the chief of police?

49
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,680
Let me drink this first.

50
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,360
The police force is an organization,
and I'm a member of it.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,570
Did you call me here to tell me
you can't investigate?

52
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,100
You know that we don't have
anything concrete

53
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,640
except the rumors about his
sexual assault and embezzlement.

54
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,310
The police need proof.

55
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,540
Proof?

56
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,340
We recorded
the pastor's statement earlier.

57
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,280
We'll soon find the account books
and his fake certificate.

58
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,950
That's forgery of official document,
fraud, and embezzlement.

59
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,380
Once the investigation starts,
they will

60
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,350
have to look for the victim
of the sexual assault.

61
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,330
By the way, mister.

62
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,500
I heard you were a competent detective
from Seoul. Is it really true?

63
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,730
It's not "mister".
Call me Detective Lee.

64
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,870
Who is your friend
who went into Guseonwon?

65
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,170
You don't need to know that.

66
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,110
Gosh, why are you hiding it?

67
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,440
Do you think I would disturb your plan?

68
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,110
I don't want to put my friend in danger.

69
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,090
Dong-cheol, you can go back to your room.

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,790
Okay.

71
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

72
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,630
I see you working hard.

73
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,630
We're getting less offerings these days.

74
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,670
If we run out of funds,
we'll have to send

75
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,340
those poor people back
to the evil world outside.

76
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,780
So please try a little harder,
Apostle Kang.

77
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
What are you suggesting I should do?

78
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,750
Well, we can have a revival service.

79
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,980
Do you think we can have

80
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,720
a revival service any time we want?

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,360
Don't be so fussy.

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,760
It's your greed that made
that detective come here.

83
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,330
You're accusing an innocent person.

84
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,800
Why is it because of me?
I'm also saved by Almighty.

85
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,170
It's not salvation that you sought here.

86
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,970
You just wanted money.
Do you think I don't know that?

87
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,409
Listen, I take care of
all our affairs here.

88
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,340
Isn't it natural that
I pay attention to our funds too?

89
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,110
You have taken enough amount,

90
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,909
so please leave now.

91
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,320
Spiritual Father and I
will lead this place from now on.

92
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,720
Eun-sil, you're biting the hand
that fed you.

93
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,290
Have you forgotten?

94
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,100
I haven't forgotten it at all.

95
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,630
Stop bringing

96
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,870
demons into this place
with your false faith, and leave now.

97

Your husband.
It's the man you killed.

98
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,080
I pulled strings
so you won't go to prison for it.

99
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,180
And now, you're telling me to leave?

100
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,130
It wasn't you who helped me.
It was Almighty.

101
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,700
You were merely used
by Almighty for his plan.

102
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I cleaned up after you,

103
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,710
and now you're saying it wasn't me.

104
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,710
That must be why you've been
holding your head so high.

105
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,080
Do you know why
I've curried favor with you all?

106
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,450
Because I'm scared of you?

107
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,150
You and Baek Jeong-gi are

108
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,020
just cash cow to me. I humor you
because it keeps you happy,

109
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,760
and you will get money
from those people.

110
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,330
Let go of me, you evil demon.

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,000

Do you see who really has power here?

I need to see her myself.

132

You can't see her right now.

133
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,350
I should go and protect Sang-mi.

134
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,620
I know it's hard,
but you have to keep calm.

135
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,290
You've been doped up with drugs,

and you just came to your senses.

137

You can't protect Sang-mi
when you're so weak.

138
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,340
For now, you have to keep acting

until your body recovers.

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,510
Only then can we deceive
all those people.

I understood.

142
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,790
I'll be going now then.

143
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,990
I can't stay here for too long.

It's my mom's birthday today.

166
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,180
(MUJI DAILY)

167
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,640
I found the medical record.

168
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,350
All believers here are
recorded as patients.

169
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,660
Why do you think they did it?

170
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,770
They made fake patients and prescriptions

171
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,700
to obtain psychotropic drugs illegally.

172
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,140
They force-fed those pills

173
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,540
to your mom or other people.

174
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,180
Also, they must have tried to raise
the sanitarium's grade

175
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,910
and get the state subsidies
by increasing the number of patients.

176
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,580
Look at this.

177
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,720
It's signed by the director of
the sanatorium and Baek Jeong-gi.

178
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,220
This means they all took part in this.

179
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,720
But do you think

180
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,920
the police will willingly
investigate this?

181
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,390
It'll be hard for the police in Muji.

182
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,700
I have a friend who works
at a TV station in Seoul.

183
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,700
I'll take this to Seoul and contact
a TV station there.

184
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,500
I'll try to make this into
a national problem.

185
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,770
Then the police and prosecution of Muji

186
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,270
won't be able to ignore this.

187
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,440
I don't think

188
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,570
we have much time left.

189
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,080
I'll go to Seoul right now
and come back with some help.

190
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,060
Thanks.

191
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,800
Don't thank me. This could only happen
because you stood strong.

192
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,500
Here.

193
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,110
Your mom wanted to

194
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,480
let you know that she's okay
and told me to give this to you.

195
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,660
Wait. Wait.

196
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,430
Sister So-rin, where do you keep
going these days?

197
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,100
Sorry? Oh, my mom's ill.

198
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,140
Apostle Kang is looking for you.

199
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,080
Hurry.

200
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Okay.

201
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,520
We brought her here, Apostle Kang.

202
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,860
Why did you want to see me,
Apostle Kang?

203
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Where did you say

204
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,090
you went to two days ago?

205
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,270
I told you that I had to go home
to visit my mom for her birthday.

206
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,470
I feel like there are so many devils
in this place these days.

207
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,210
I should've been careful not
to bring them in in the first place.

208
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,110
What did I say happens to you
when you lie before our Almighty?

209
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,250
I found out that you weren't
a student before you came here.

210
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,650
You were a reporter.

211
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,090
You were a local news reporter
at Muji Daily.

212
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,930
Apostle Kang, please let me explain.

213
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,160
Did you come here to approach Sang-mi?

214
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,830
No, that's not it. I think there
has been a misunderstanding.

215
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,870
You filthy creature.
I cannot stand you.

216
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,710
How can you be so brazen
before our Almighty?

217
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,740
Put her inside.

218
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,950
Apostle Kang. Apostle Kang, wait.

219
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,190
Who else is there?

220
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,990
Who else

221
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,260
is a devil in disguise trying
to destroy Guseonwon like you?

222
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm going to get rid of
every single devil in this place.

223
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,900
Today is the day that our
soon-to-be Spiritual Mother

224
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,040
is going to share what she's learned
through her spiritual training

225
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
with our believers

226
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,410
and her mother.

227
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,890
A Spiritual Mother
should be able to

228
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,089
speak the language of paradise

229
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,890
in front of all our believers
from now on.

230
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,260
If Sang-mi has diligently learned

231
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,700
what Apostle Kang has taught her,

232
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,339
I trust that our Almighty will

233
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,280
grant her with the ability to speak
the language of paradise today.

234
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,410
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

235
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,380
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

236
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,750
Honey, watch carefully.

237
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,760
Look how faithful our daughter has become.

238
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,130
My savior.

239
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,340
I believe in you, my Almighty,
who has granted me life.

240
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,450
You have brought our family here

241
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,050
and enabled us to meet Spiritual Father.

242
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,220
And...

243
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,660
And I believe that

244
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,230
the hardship you gave to my brother,
Sang-jin, and my mother

245
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,970
was all part of your big plan
to make me become

246
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,370
the Spiritual Mother.

247
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,710
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

248
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,950
Spiritual Father!

249
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,620
(Make her take one pill a day.)

250
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
(IM SANG-MI)

251
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,240
(SUFFERING DEPRESSION AND SLEEP
DISORDER, ZOLPIDEM PRESCRIBED)

252
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,610
I think we should test Sang-mi

253
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,980
if she's truly capable of becoming
our Spiritual Mother.

254
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Okay.

255
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,320
Why hasn't Jeong-hun come back?
I can't reach him either.

256
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,120
I wonder if he got caught by his dad
when he went home.

257
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,360
Just a second.

258
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,660
-Gosh, it's so hot.
-You're here.

259
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,830
It's so cool here.

260
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,010
Hey, is Jeong-hun going to church
these days? It doesn't suit him.

261
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,910
What did you just say?

262
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,840
He was

263
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,780
going somewhere on
a church van yesterday.

264
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,320
A van?

265
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,450
Yes.

266
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,790
Did that van

267
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,860
have a sign saying "Guseonwon"?

268
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,460
"Guseonwon"?

269
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,530
It said, "Join us on the happy
journey to paradise."

270
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,730
You guys should be careful too.

271
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,940
That guy with a perm is looking
all over the place for you guys.

272
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,300
It's them.

273
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,970
Sang-hwan, what should we do?

274
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,240
Was I correct?

275
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,980
My gosh, I have such a good memory.

276
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,410
Bye.

277
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,610
(I think they caught Jeong-hun
and took him there.)

278
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,050
(Please try to find out where he is.)

279
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,660
Why are you so surprised?

280
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,130
No, it's nothing.

281
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,260
I'll be off then.

282
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,330
Okay.

283
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,050
I have a talent in finding hidden things.

284
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,640
My gosh, I can't believe this guy.

285
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,470
Hey, Dong-cheol.

286
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,010
Really?

287
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,910
Okay.

288
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,610
Let's go.

289
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,420
These guys really aren't humans.

290
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,850
Wait.

291
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,370
Sang-hwan, you should drive
more carefully.

292
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,540
Hey, let me borrow your car.

293
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,810
What are you talking about?

294
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,010
-Hurry.
-Thanks.

295
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,280
What went wrong this time?

296
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,010
You guys are unbelievable.

297
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,220
Do you think I work at
a car rental center?

298
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,950
Thanks.

299
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,620
My gosh.

300
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,660
What's going on?

301
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,730
Bring me some tools.

302
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,890
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

303
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,920
I'll be back.

304
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,980
I mean, seriously.

305
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,620
I'm always doing all the dirty stuff
for Guseonwon.

306
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,720
How dare she try to kick me out
when she should be thanking me?

307
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,690
Those who repay people's kindness
with betrayal

308
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,100
are monsters, not humans.

309
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,840
Gosh, my back hurts.

310
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,270
Wan-deok! Hey, Wan-deok!

311
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,740
That's deep enough.
You can bury him now.

312
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,020
My gosh.

313
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,160
That's right.

314
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,790
I'm hungry.

315
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,760
Let's go eat (sundaeguk). I'm hungry.

316
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,370
From here, we have to go this way,

317
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,410
and turn left.

318
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
This place is creepy at night.

319
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,720
We need to stay alert.

320
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,760
Let's go.

321
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,360
Do you know who she is?

322
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,760
Yes.

323
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,600
She's my helper.

324
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,730
No. She's no longer

325
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,440
the helper you thought she was.

326
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,840
She's a devil

327
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,810
who's trying to destroy your soul.

328
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,250
Did you

329
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,780
get blinded by this woman?

330
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,150
No.

331
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,820
You must always tell the truth
to Spiritual Father.

332
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,990
Do you understand?

333
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,600
Yes.

334
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,630
What did

335
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,730
she say to you while she was with you?

336
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,870
She didn't say anything.

337
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,680
She only delivered Apostle Kang's
messages to me.

338
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,840
Did you know that she is a reporter

339
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,420
who's getting controlled by the devil?

340
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,750
No.

341
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,460
We must get rid of every single devil

342
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
in Guseonwon.

343
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,890
I believe it.

344
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,470
If you

345
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,540
really did not get blinded by her,

346
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,110
you should

347
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,080
carry out a fire prayer for her.

348
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,080
Please save me.

349
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,220
I don't know anything.

350
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,190
Please do not get fooled by the devil.

351
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,930
The devil always approaches us
in the most

352
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,430
pitiful form

353
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,430
and uses that as a scheme

354
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,270
to weaken our hearts.

355
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,200
Sang-mi, hurry up and
kick the devil out of here.

356
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,740
You can do it.

357
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,540
You even prayed passionately

358
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,310
to our Almighty a while ago.

359
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,550
Sang-mi, you need to run away.

360
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,720
Can you see?

361
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,150
There are so many devils hiding
in this place.

362
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,790
Sang-mi, hurry up.

363
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,260
Your mother

364
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,700
also wants you to

365
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,460
You dirty

366
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,770
devil!

367
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,500
Get lost!

368
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,010
No, that's not me.

369
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,710
I'm not a devil.

370
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,310
With the fire of our Almighty

371
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,020
With his hot fire,

372
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,320
I command you, the dirty devil,

373
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,720
to get lost!

374
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,410
You cannot come in here.

375
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,380
No, it's just that I saw a few weird guys
secretly coming in here.

376
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,280
Who are you talking about?

377
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,720
They seemed like my age.

378
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,660
One was tall, and the other one
was a bit chubby.

379
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,060
I saw them going over
to the storage in the woods.

380
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,870
-We need to go right now.
-What?

381
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,580
-They're here.
-Who's here?

382
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,650
Those guys who took Sang-mi.

383
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,950
Where are they right now?

384
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,550
They went to the prayer room in the woods.

385
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,690
What? The prayer room?

386
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,160
Follow me. Hurry up.

387
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,100
Jeong-hun. Jeong-hun.

388
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,430
Jeong-hun.

389
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,270
Jeong-hun.

390
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,140
Jeong-hun.

391
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,540
Is that him?

392
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,910
Jeong-hun.

393
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,620
Move over.

394
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,890
Jeong-hun.

395
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,860
Jeong-hun, are you okay?

396
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
(-Hurry up!)
-Wait, wait.

397
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,940
Let's go this way.

398
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,690
Darn it.

399
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,270
I see those punks.

400
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,880
Be careful.

401
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,880
Are you okay?

402
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,560
Here! I caught them!

403
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,390
What are you doing?

404
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,030
Hurry up, and punch me.

405
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,400
Over here! Hurry up!

406
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,770
You demons!

407
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,150
Stop them!

408
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,820
Get them!

409
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,250
Hey!

410
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Jeong-hun, are you okay?

411
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,930
I'm all right.

412
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,300
They will

413
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,410
mess up everyone in Muji
if we don't stop them.

414
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,050
I'm so grateful

415
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,449
that I have you guys.

416
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,420
By the way,

417
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,130
how did you say you saw those young men?

418
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,130
Well, I was on my way
to the prayer room in the woods,

419
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,900
and I saw some strange boys
passing by.

420
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,810
I just thought they might be the ones.

421
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,480
Gosh, you did a really good thing.

422
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,540
You're amazing.

423
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,280
Not at all.

424
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,850
It must have been dark in the woods.

425
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,250
How did you know
they were the ones right away?

426
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,960
I heard their voices.

427
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,790
They said something about
getting someone out,

428
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,730
and how they should be careful
of this cult.

429
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,660
I heard things like that.

430
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,930
They're acting like
they're the truth when they're fake.

431
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,230
We should not be deceived
by things like that.

432
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,070
That is why we pray
and have worship every day.

433
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,410
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-I believe it.

434
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,710
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

435
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,050
Almighty sent a precious soul to us today.

436
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,790
He is

437
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,020
a blessed gatekeeper of Guseonwon.

438
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,060
Am I?

439
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,060
Congratulations.

440
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,900
You have been given a gracious duty.

441
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,070
I'm sorry?

442
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,170
Thank you.

443
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,850
Now, Apostle Im should take
Spiritual Mother and go.

444
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:57,520
Apostle Kang, please prepare
the night worship with Dong-cheol.

445
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,350
Yes, Spiritual Father.

446
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,340
Please wait.

447
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,840
What is it?

448
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,050
I just received a divine revelation
from Almighty.

449
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,450
He says we shouldn't just send away
the one who fought with the demons.

450
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,830
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

451
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,260
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

452
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,830
Dad, please give me Living Water.

453
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Sure.

454
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,290
All of them.

455
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,730
Thank you.

456
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,530
Sure.

457
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,870
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

458
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,080
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

459
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,110
Let's go.

460
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,350
Why didn't you tell me?

461
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,790
Why did you do something unnecessary
and make those demons

462
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,590
come inside of Guseonwon?

463
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,830
Why?

464
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,360
Don't ask me.

465
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,600
You should just ask Almighty directly.

466
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,540
What do you mean by that?

467
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,910
I'm saying this is all because of you.

468
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,240
They're digging up your past

469
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,880
and broadcasting it on the internet.

470
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,750
It will complicate things.

471
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,490
I think it's time to leave this place.

472
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,120
It's a small town,

473
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,520
and we've been here
for about five years. That's enough.

474
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,990
They're doing this
because of Sang-mi anyway.

475
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
Let's let her go

476
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,630
and leave this place quietly, okay?

477
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,530
It might cause us bigger trouble

478
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,270
if the police get involved.

479
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,470
Sang-mi and I will soon have
our spiritual wedding

480
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,210
where she will become
our Spiritual Mother.

481
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,440
Until then, please don't cause
any more problems.

482
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,680
Darn it, are you insane?

483
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,680
If you want to mess around with her,
just do it right now!

484
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,990
Why are you obsessing
so much about Sang-mi?

485
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,860
If you need a girl, just tell me.

486
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,490
Among the believers, I will--

487
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,360
It looks like

488
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,600
Apostle Kang was right.

489
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,540
She said demons have filled up
this place at some point.

490
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,840
Are you talking about me?

491
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,480
Those who have lost their faith

492
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,020
are no longer the children of Almighty.

493
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,890
Apostle Jo.

494
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,990
Please

495
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,430
leave us now.

496
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
What?

497
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,200
I've been treating you like
you're really the Spiritual Father,

498
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,540
and you've gone insane.

499
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,140
You lunatic.

500
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,380
You've been convicted of fraud
eight times. Prisoner 6100,

501
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,520
that's who you really are, you crazy jerk.

502
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,350
You crept and crawled to me like a dog.

503
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,560
Have you forgotten it?

504
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Hit me.

505
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,510
Hit me with it.

506
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
If you hit me,

507
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:25,290
do you think you will get
everything you want?

508
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,500
The prisoner you knew in the past

509
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,730
died already.

510
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,810
I am

511
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,080
the father of all spirits
who will lead you

512
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,120
to the paradise.

513
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,790
Do you understand?

514
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,350
Don't let what happened today bother you,

515
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,080
and pray harder.

516
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,820
Dad.

517
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
Yes?

518
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,000
Please let me see Mom.

519
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,570
I can't.

520
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,740
You're not supposed to see her
during your training.

521
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,140
Almighty showed me his divine revelation.

522
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,310
What?

523
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,180
Is that true?

524
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,320
Yes.

525
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,220
Almighty came to my dream last night.

526
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,530
He said I have to be with her
when I pray for her.

527
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,900
If I do, she will be free
from her illness,

528
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,230
and I will truly become
Spiritual Mother.

529
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,710
Excuse me, Apostle Kang.

530
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,040
What is it?

531
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,680
May I use the toilet?

532
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,310
My stomach hurts probably
because I'm relaxed now.

533
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,080
Apostle Kang.

534
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,290
You need to lead the chant now.

535
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,660
Shall I tell everyone to pray
for a little while if you're busy?

536
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,490
No, it's okay.

537
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,660
-You may go.
-Thank you.

538
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,360
-Let's go upstairs.
-Okay.

539
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,780
They abducted him and beat him up.

540
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,350
-Are you sure about that?
-Can't you tell?

541
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,420
Why did you bring him to me instead
of taking him to the hospital?

542
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,890
Those jerks can show up
at the hospital here anytime.

543
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,790
We'll take him to the city,
but we want to ask you for a favor first.

544
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,160
They abduct, confine,
and beat people up to death.

545
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,970
I need to get my friends
out of there as soon as possible.

546
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,540
The police need to get involved.

547
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,340
I told you the other day.

548
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,710
You guys are probably
too young to understand, but--

549
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,910
Don't blame others.
Can't you just try?

550
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,950
-What?
-Stop blaming the lack of evidence,

551
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,380
the hierarchy, and the fact
that it's a religious organization.

552
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,090
Even a dead body has been found.
When will the police get involved?

553
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,790
Gosh, you punks drive me crazy.

554
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,290
Chief needs to meet with Mr. Han first
in order to take any action.

555
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,800
In Muji, no one can do anything
without your dad's permission.

556
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,430
We'll take him to a hospital
and get a medical report first.

557
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,940
They committed assault, coercion,
abduction, and confinement.

558
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,170
We'll press charges against them
for everything they've done.

559
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,410
My dad won't be able to stop me
if the media takes interest in it.

560
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,980
I'll make that happen.

561
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,550
So please.
You have to do something about it.

562
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,150
It'll turn into a pretty big case
once the media becomes interested.

563
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,660
If you help us out,
all of your work will eventually

564
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,660
get recognized, don't you think?

565
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,430
You're right.
I should move back to Seoul.

566
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,130
Sure, let's take action.

567
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,670
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired of this place.

568
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,200
We'll get going then.

569
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,980
-Man-hui
-Yes.

570
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,980
You should take Jeong-hun
to a hospital.

571
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,250
I want to try

572
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,020
talking to my dad one last time.

573
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,160
Sang-hwan, what will you do
with your dad?

574
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,490
If he continues to try
to stop the investigation,

575
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,760
I'll have no choice
but to press charges against him.

576
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,370
A son pressing charges against
his father will hopefully make

577
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,700
people and the media become interested.

578
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,070
(Dong-cheol, Jeong-hun is fine.)

579
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,280
(I'll raid that place with the police
tomorrow no matter what,)

580
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,850
(so I hope you and Sang-mi
can stay strong until then.)

581
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,020
Sang-mi.

582
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:05,960
Sang-mi.

583
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,360
Honey.

584
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,200
Sang-mi is here

585
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,300
to pray for you.

586
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,300
To pray for me?

587
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,780
Mom.

588
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,280
Don't worry about anything.

589
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,120
Of course. I'm in the paradise.

590
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,760
That's right.

591
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,720
This place

592
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,190
is the paradise.

593
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,570
Oh, no. This is priceless.

594
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,580
You should've been careful.

595
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,410
I'm sorry.

596
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,150
Dad, can you get me
another vile of Living Water?

597
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:09,020
All right. I'll be right back.

598
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,220
Honey, you and Sang-mi should...

599
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,430
I mean, Spiritual Mother.
You should stay with her here.

600
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,230
Okay?

601
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,410
Sang-mi.

602
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,710
Are you really okay?

603
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,140
Yes.

604
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,150
I'm fine.

605
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,720
This must be so hard for you.

606
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,790
I'm sorry.

607
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,490
I should've come to my senses
a lot sooner.

608
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,900
Don't say that. It's not your fault.

609
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,600
Those people made you like this.

610
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,630
Now, we need to take them down.

611
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,770
So please...

612
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,910
Try to stay strong
for just a little longer, okay?

613
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,310
What can you do by yourself though?

614
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,180
Mom.

615
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,620
I'm not doing this alone.

616
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,690
I have friends who are helping me.

617
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,460
And I'm not weak.

618
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,760
I'm your daughter, you know.

619
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,200
I'm strong, just like you.

620
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,130
So

621
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,800
don't worry too much, okay?

622
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,870
Dad.

623
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:39,970
Yes?

624
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,840
I need to use the washroom quickly.

625
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,010
All right.
I'll wait for you outside.

626
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,410
Okay.

627
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,250
Is it you, Dong-cheol?

628
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,050
Yes, it's me.

629
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,060
Those jerks brought the reporter here,

630
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,530
but I'm not sure where they took her.

631
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,900
Is there any place
that comes to your mind?

632
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,400
I think I know where they took her.

633
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,800
In the basement, there's a separate ward

634
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,870
where they confine patients
that have caused problems.

635
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,340
All right. I'll go down there.

636
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:07,130
Gosh, why are there so many flies here?

637
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,660
Hey, don't you dare!

638
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,840
All right, everyone.
Do you know where I am now?

639
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,110
You remember the scary, shocking video
I recently uploaded

640
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,710
about the cult leader, right?

641
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,110
I'm back at their building. Look.

642
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,520
It's called Guseonwon.

643
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,090
Look at this. It's so spooky here.

644
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:37,820
This place totally gives you
the creeps. That car is

645
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,490
It's a police car.

646
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,530
Guys, I better hide now.

647
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,500
All right. The car is coming closer.

648
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:51,800
Both the police car
and the other car stopped.

649
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,570
Let's see.
We should see what happens.

650
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,770
My gosh, Sergeant Woo.

651
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,980
-Hello, how have you been?
-Good. You're working so hard.

652
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,950
-Just a second, please.
-Sure.

653
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,480
Gosh, you didn't have
to get me anything.

654
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,350
You have to stay healthy

655
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,390
to provide for your wife and son.
Aren't I right?

656
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,190
I can't keep accepting things like this.

657
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,530
Why? Don't worry. No one knows,
and no one will find out.

658
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,440
How dare you! Goodness.

659
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,480
Gosh, you sure have gotten gutsy.

660
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,450
Did you run away from home or what?

661
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,620
-Dad.
-What?

662
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,550
When will you come home?

663
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,160
You should come home.
Do you love your friends that much?

664
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,260
I'll go home today.

665
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,600
Why did you call me?

666
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:54,230
Because I missed you.

667
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,070
He said he missed me.

668
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,410
Cut it out. You're making me cringe.

669
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,010
Stop missing me. You should
spend that time to study hard.

670
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,180
That's how you can be a good son.

671
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,750
You got that?

672
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,350
Jeong-hun.

673
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,550
Yes.

674
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,190
-That silly boy.
-My gosh.

675
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,370
Jeong-hun.

676
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,200
I'll take you to the hospital now.

677
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,370
All right. Let's go.

678
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,850
You probably want to say
that this place is fake,

679
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,760
but it's real.

680
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,960
I'll make it real.

681
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,630
Sister So-rin,

682
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,370
this injection will make you

683
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,840
believe that this place is the paradise.

684
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,080
So don't worry about anything, okay?

685
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,680
Why are you here?

686
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,790
What are you doing now?

687
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,580
Are you all right?

688
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,450
If you go that way into the forest,

689
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,480
you'll get to a stream
with a small bridge.

690
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,490
You can meet my friend there
and get help from him.

691
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,520
I'll give him a call now.

692
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,920
His name is Han Sang-hwan.

693
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,760
What about you and Sang-mi?

694
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,600
We'll take everyone here with us.

695
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,300
You need to get out of here and tell
the whole world about this place.

696
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,230
Okay.

697
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,340
Be careful, okay?

698
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,610
I promise you I'll come back.

699
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,770
All right.

700
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,830
Hey, Dong-cheol.

701
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,060
Is Jeong-hun okay?

702
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,160
Yes.

703
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,200
Man-hui took him to the hospital,
so he'll be fine.

704
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,400
What about you guys?

705
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:43,900
We're okay too.

706
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,770
Sang-hwan. By the way,

707
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,940
I need you to go
to Muji Creek right now.

708
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,310
Muji Creek? Really?

709
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,450
I helped the reporter escape,
and she's on her way there now.

710
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,580
Take her to Eun-seong's place
so that she can hide there.

711
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,750
Okay. I'll leave right now.

712
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,890
Dong-cheol.

713
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,890
What is it?

714
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,130
We'll raid that place
with the police tomorrow.

715
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,700
This time, we have evidence
because Jeong-hun got beaten up.

716
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,060
They won't be able to get out of it.

717
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,430
You just need to hold out tonight.

718
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,600
All right.

719
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,770
You be careful too.

720
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,470
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

721
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,270
Almighty must love me very much.

722
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,170
I mean, who thought
I would run into you right here?

723
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,840
Aren't I right,
Reporter Hong So-rin?

724
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:11,850
Yes, hello?

725
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,420
(Sang...)

726
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,690
(Hwan.)

727
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,390
Mom?

728
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,200
Yes, it's me.

729
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:42,310
(SAVE ME)

730
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,880
Mom, Mom.

731
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,120
Mom, did you move on your own?

732
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,970
Mom.

733
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,710
Your dad...

734
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,220
Where is he?
