(SAVE ME)

2
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,640
(EPISODE 10)

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,410
(GUSEONWON)

4
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,850
The worship service has begun.

5
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,480
Let's go.

6
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,480
I'll go on my own.

7
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:51,170
Dong-cheol, I'll block them.

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,910
Go inside and get the books.

9
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Hey.

10
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,950
Dong-cheol.

11
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,320
You can't take the books.

12
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,630
You have to understand
that I work for Jin-seok.

13
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,500
Everyone in this world is sinful,

14
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,540
but not everyone repents of their faults.

15
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,950
If a sinful person does not repent
his wrongdoings,

16
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,210
he will be

17
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,420
judged by our Almighty eventually.

18
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,620
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

19
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,160
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

20
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,670
Sang-mi, please come.

21
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,670
Everyone, Sang-mi has

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,580
returned to Guseonwon.

23
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,580
Let us applaud her.

24
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,470
Spiritual Father,

25
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,970
I am very sorry.

26
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,740
Sang-mi.

27
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,910
Why did you come back?

28
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,720
As I hear,

29
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,990
you told people that you wanted
to come back to Guseonwon yourself.

30
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,420
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

31
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,660
Do you think

32
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,060
I wanted to come back?

33
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,530
I already said no.

34
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,600
It's not grace or salvation
to coerce me into submission.

35
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,900
The true evil

36
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,340
is you.

37
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,380
I came back to protect my mom from you!

38
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,610
Sang-mi.

39
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,460
Sang-mi, it seems like

40
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,060
you are mistaken about something.

41
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,670
The feeling of aversion
that you're having right now

42
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,510
is what's coming from the evil.

43
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,570
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

44
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm so sick of you
talking about the evil!

45
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,850
You should all get a hold of yourselves.

46
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,180
You've given him your houses,
money, land, and everything else!

47
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,850
All you do here is work.

48
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,159
Do you think that's salvation?

49
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,100
It's no use praying here every day.

50
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,930
Go home and see your family.

51
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,970
Go and see

52
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,940
how frustrated they are because of you!

53
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,680
Get out, everyone.

54
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,280
Stop being fooled,

55
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,950
and get out of here!

56
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,060
See?

57
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,060
This is the evil!

58
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,430
-I believe it!
-I believe it!

59
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,659
I can no longer

60
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,500
watch Sang-mi's soul die.

61
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,670
It is now time for everyone in Guseonwon

62
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,240
to stand together and pray with fire.

63
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,909
Stop talking crazy things.

64
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,980
You're insane.

65
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,760
Sang-mi, you are not the pure soul

66
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,990
we used to know anymore.

67
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,130
You're right.

68
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,700
She's not my daughter that I know.

69
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,200
She may look the same way,

70
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,940
but her soul is already
captured by the evil.

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,770
Almighty, please.

72
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,880
Please save my daughter.

73
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,610
Do not worry.

74
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,510
Sang-mi will

75
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,690
win the spiritual fight no matter what.

76
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,520
I believe it!
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

77
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,720
You're right.

78
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,890
I am

79
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,159
never going to be defeated by you.

80
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,630
That's right.

81
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,670
There was a time

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,380
Apostle Kang's daughter

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,150
said the same thing as Sang-mi.

84
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,990
This is how amazing

85
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,000
our Almighty's plan is.

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,830
I didn't realize why Almighty would

87
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,240
give Apostle Kang a painful hardship.

88
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,140
He wanted to train Apostle Kang

89
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,040
so that she can help Sang-mi

90
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,540
become our Spiritual Mother.

91
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,880
Don't you think so?

92
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,450
I do.

93
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,550
I will do

94
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,159
everything I can to make
Sang-mi our Spiritual Mother.

95
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,330
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

96
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,630
I command you

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,670
in the name of our divine Almighty.

98
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,210
-Almighty!
-In the name of Almighty!

99
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,880
The evil that resides inside her,

100
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,950
you shall leave my loved one right now!

101
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,980
-I believe it!
-I believe it!

102
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,950
Let us all pray together in unison.

103
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,970
You filthy evil!

104
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Leave her right now!

105
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,840
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

106
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,650
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

107
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,510
Can't you leave the books and go?

108
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,880
Will you leave if I tell you to leave?

109
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,960
Jun-gu.

110
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,760
Could you just let him go?

111
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,100
Do you know him?

112
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,500
What did I tell you back in the prison?

113
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,640
I told you not to trust anyone.

114
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,340
Someone will stab you in the back again.

115
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,580
See? You never know
what people would do.

116
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,950
You would

117
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,160
do anything for money just like others!

118
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,500
If you bare your teeth to me,

119
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,300
I will break them all.

120
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,280
-Gosh, Jeong-hun!
-Dad.

121
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,320
Let me explain.

122
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,750
What did I tell you?

123
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,390
I told you to study hard and
go to college without causing trouble.

124
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,630
Yes, Dad. Gosh, you're killing me.

125
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm about to die of anger because of you.

126
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,260
-Wait.
-That's enough.

127
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,370
Gosh, Chief Lee.

128
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,470
We're all in the police force.

129
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,770
This is really embarrassing.

130
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,340
Right.

131
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,710
We're all in the police force.

132
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,490
Everyone! You should hit it harder!

133
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,720
So the evil will scream and run away!

134
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,360
Our wishes will be fulfilled!
Our wishes

135
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,230
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

136
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,300
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

137
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,810
No. No!

138
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,240
No! Sang-mi!

139
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,010
Don't hit Sang-mi. Don't hit her.

140
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,950
I'm sorry. I'm begging you.

141
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,050
Please don't hit Sang-mi.

142
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,350
Mom.

143
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,960
Honey, help me.

144
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,660
Help our daughter, Sang-mi.

145
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,670
It looks like the evil that
was clinging on to Sang-mi

146
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,830
has gone over to

147
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,600
her mother now.

148
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,880
You cruel evil!

149
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,950
Please.
Please stop harassing my family.

150
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,420
Get out of my wife's body!

151
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,520
No! Mom! Mom!

152
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,890
You're crazy.
What do you think you're doing?

153
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,790
First, you took my son.

154
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,160
And now, you're trying to take away
my daughter and wife?

155
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,730
Get out! Get out of my wife's body!

156
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,040
-Dad!
-Get lost!

157
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,840
-No, stop.
-Go away!

158
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,340
Get lost!

159
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,980
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

160
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,440
-I believe it.
-I believe it.

161
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,080
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-I believe it.

162
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,710
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-I believe it.

163
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,580
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-I believe it.

164
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,490
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-I believe it.

165
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,060
(WE WILL STAND STRONG AGAINST CRIME,
AND SUPPORT THE PEOPLE OF MUJI)

166
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,800
The girl's father wants the boys
to get punished.

167
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,470
Detective Lee.

168
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,940
You're here.

169
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,410
My goodness, you're here.
You're finally here.

170
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,180
I need to have a word with you.

171
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,290
The governor's son brought his friend here

172
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,460
saying that she needs help
to get out of a cult.

173
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,600
But her parents had already reported
that she had gotten abducted.

174
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,000
It can be quite a difficult case
if I follow regular procedures.

175
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,800
But I'll take care of this so that
it won't affect the governor.

176
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,740
It sounds as if you want
something in return.

177
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,840
Don't be mistaken.

178
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,950
And about that thing you asked me
to take care of regarding Mr. Cheon

179
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,620
I'll be getting a warrant today,
so it'll be taken care of tomorrow.

180
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,950
You can tell the governor that
he doesn't need to worry.

181
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,890
Are you a criminal?
Why would you get in the back seat?

182
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,940
Listen. Dad.

183
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,210
My friend was in trouble.
I couldn't ignore that.

184
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,950
I was just trying to do a good deed.

185
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,780
Come on, Dad.

186
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,150
Stop it. Just stop!

187
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,330
Just ignore her.

188
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,230
You just need to study hard
and go to university.

189
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Now, that's a good deed.
Do you understand?

190
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,270
Dad.

191
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,530
You should stay here,

192
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,170
repent on your dirty sin,
and cleanse yourself.

193
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,940
You'll

194
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,110
never be able to receive salvation here.

195
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,350
Sang-mi.

196
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,920
You need to become the Spiritual Mother.
That's the only way

197
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,360
our family will be able
to get on the Boat of Salvation.

198
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
That's right, Sang-mi.

199
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,170
Please wake up.

200
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,370
Wake up and open your eyes
to this surprising wisdom.

201
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,950
I want Sang-jin to

202
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,920
receive salvation more than anyone.

203
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,290
But that's not going to happen here.

204
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,230
You're only getting fooled
by their dirty tricks and lies.

205
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,660
Apostle Kang.

206
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,590
What's going on?

207
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,100
Is something worrying you these days,
Apostle Kang?

208
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,900
I'm surprised to see that
you're looking out for me.

209
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,040
Thank you for the kind gesture,
but I'm fine. Don't worry.

210
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,310
My gosh, how can I not worry?

211
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,210
Everybody here knows that

212
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,780
you're the best when it comes
to propagating our religion.

213
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,160
Apostle Jo, do you have a will
to receive salvation?

214
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,730
-Sorry?
-I personally think

215
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,930
your will lies not in salvation,
but in something else.

216
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,329
My gosh, Apostle Kang.

217
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,510
You're being way too straightforward.

218
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,470
Your job is to help

219
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,980
Spiritual Father bring out
the spirituality from our believers.

220
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,980
But my job is to make sure
Guseonwon runs well

221
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,580
by taking care of all the business.

222
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,750
You can't say that just because I brought
less people than you have.

223
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,860
Okay.

224
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,330
Then from now on,
let's not be mistaken about each other.

225
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,370
You cannot afford to make
a mistake this time.

226
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,410
You need to make sure Sang-mi
becomes our Spiritual Mother.

227
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,640
That's the only way me,
our Spiritual Father,

228
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,980
you, and your daughter,

229
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,110
will all be able to get on
the Boat of Salvation.

230
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,180
Don't you agree?

231
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,330
You should always stay awake.
It would be a pity

232
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,130
if you fail to get on the Boat of
Salvation all by yourself.

233
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,600
I believe it.

234
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,940
Yes, that's the Kang Eun-sil I know.

235
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,610
I hope your belief continues
to stay strong

236
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,980
forever.

237
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,020
(MUJI HANGIL NURSING HOME)

238
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,570
The look in your eyes
haven't changed at all.

239
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,210
That's exactly how your father
used to look at me.

240
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,270
He always

241
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,910
just thought of me as a butcher's son.

242
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,420
I thought things would all be over
when he passed away.

243
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,190
But one day,
you also started to look at me

244
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,290
with despise, just like your father.

245
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,660
But

246
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,270
Ji-hui

247
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,670
doesn't look at me like you do.

248
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,310
She respects me.

249
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,680
It's something you were never
able to give me.

250
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,810
But Ji-hui is able to give me that.

251
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,580
So you can just stay like that,

252
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,850
and never wake up.

253
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,790
That way, people will remember me
as a loving husband

254
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,820
who cares for his sick wife.

255
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,370
Honey, you should wake up now.

256
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,900
You know how much Sang-hwan
is worried about you.

257
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,510
Dad.

258
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,540
Yes?

259
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,520
This wouldn't have happened
if you stayed in Seoul.

260
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,590
Your mom would've been so worried
if she knew about what happened.

261
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,290
I have a favor to ask of you.

262
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,300
My friend is involved a weird cult.

263
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,000
But she's having trouble
getting out of there.

264
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,070
It's called Guseonwon.

265
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,570
They have a sanitarium,
a collective farm,

266
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,970
and they do a lot of volunteer work.

267
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,680
So they seem like any other normal church.

268
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,210
But they're actually a weird cult.

269
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,150
Please help my friend

270
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,450
so that she can get out of there
and live a proper life.

271
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,890
I'm a politician.

272
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,790
If you want to ask me for a favor,

273
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,630
you need to give me something in return.

274
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,440
Okay.

275
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
I'll go back to Seoul.

276
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,740
I'll go back, and become a judge.

277
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,810
Are you satisfied?

278
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,450
Okay.

279
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,020
I'll look into it.

280
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,890
Thank you.

281
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,800
Don't mention it.
We're father and son.

282
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,870
Let's go home now so that
your mom can take some rest.

283
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
Jun-gu.

284
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,870
I owed you one
since you helped me out in prison.

285
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,840
That's why I didn't ask
what this was all about.

286
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,480
But what's that jerk doing here?

287
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,920
Why? Do you know Detective Lee?

288
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,860
What? We met three years ago, right?

289
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,760
I'm going to go now.

290
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,790
Is today some kind of day?

291
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,830
The governor's son already gave me
enough nonsense this morning.

292
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,100
Are you talking about Sang-hwan?

293
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,600
Do you know him too?

294
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,470
My gosh, this neighborhood is
way too tiny.

295
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,470
What did he do?

296
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,680
He brought this girl saying that
she's involved in some kind of cult.

297
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,210
What happened to her?

298
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,050
Do you know her too?

299
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,050
Her dad took her back.

300
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,850
What do you mean?

301
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,320
You're a cop.

302
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,630
Why did you send her back?

303
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,330
My gosh, you are all so annoying.

304
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,900
Why are you acting up just like Sang-hwan?

305
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,530
You haven't changed at all.

306
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,700
What? Hey, you should know
how to kill your temper

307
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,800
if you've been to prison.

308
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,940
I might as well just lock you up again.

309
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,810
I don't owe you anything anymore.

310
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,180
That little...

311
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,600
Does he work for you?
You should teach him some manners.

312
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
Guys like him

313
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,440
can't be tamed.
We just have to let him live his own life.

314
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,910
You got the account book, right?

315
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,050
Can I do whatever I want

316
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,620
with Lee Jin-seok now?

317
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,550
Is she taking her medicine regularly?

318
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,350
Yes.

319
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,650
Okay. You can leave now.

320
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,810
Sister Kim.

321
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,540
Sang-mi left this place,
but she came back.

322
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,580
She could've stayed there,
but she chose to come back.

323
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,450
Do you know why?

324
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,890
She came back because of you.

325
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,860
My daughter

326
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,630
My daughter, Yu-ra, left this place.

327
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,730
Because of that, she made me
commit a big sin

328
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,040
to our Almighty and Spiritual Father.
But Sang-mi came back.

329
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,220
I hate you so much because of that.

330
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,850
You have a daughter who wants
to protect you even when you're crazy.

331
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,220
And I really hate that.

332
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,400
My love.

333
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,700
My savior.

334
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,200
My Almighty.

335
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,370
My loving Spiritual Father.

336
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,510
Yes.

337
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,350
You need to stay here like this forever.

338
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,620
I'm going to make your daughter
into our Spiritual Mother,

339
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,760
and do the best I can for our Almighty.

340
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,620
That way, I'll be able to get
on the Boat of Salvation with my daughter.

341
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,360
So you need to stay here

342
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,230
and keep Sang-mi from leaving.

343
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,670
That's what you must do.

344
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,210
This place is paradise.

345
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,380
Salvation. Eternal life.

346
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,050
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

347
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,720
It feels like I'm shooting a spy movie.

348
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,030
Who should I get for you first?

349
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,300
Mr. Cheon? Senator Park?

350
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,840
-Detective Lee.
-Yes?

351
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,080
You should know how to keep
a straight face.

352
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,710
Otherwise, you won't be able
to gain much from anything.

353
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,420
Okay.

354
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,820
Catch Mr. Park first.
He works for Mr. Cheon.

355
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,190
Okay.

356
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,390
But I have to say,

357
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,860
since the governor's locking up all
the corrupt politicians,.

358
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,270
Muji might soon become
the cleanest town in Korea.

359
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,140
That's only possible thanks
to people like you

360
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,310
who try their best

361
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,070
to make that happen.

362
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,710
Bye then.

363
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,890
What are you jerks trying to

364
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,290
plan this time?

365
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,430
You better not get involved
in gambling, okay?

366
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,930
Come on, Aunt.
It's nothing like that.

367
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,730
Who are you calling "Aunt"?

368
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,700
Just think of me as
your older sister.

369
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,040
(-My gosh, you're Dong-cheol.
-Yes.)

370
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,950
(-What happened to your face?
-It's nothing.)

371
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,320
Hey.

372
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,190
What happened?

373
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,890
Why did she go back?

374
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,060
Sang-mi

375
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,930
already knew that things would
turn out like this.

376
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,070
That cult named Guseonwon

377
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,210
is even capable of controlling the police.

378
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,010
I'm going to try whatever I can
by using my own method.

379
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,780
What are you going to do?

380
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,190
I asked my dad

381
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,220
for help.

382
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,260
I don't trust

383
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,800
adults.

384
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,100
Dong-cheol, I also--

385
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,330
It's all useless.

386
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,770
I'm also going to do things my way now.

387
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,870
What do you mean?

388
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,980
You always used your brain,
and I always used my guts.

389
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,280
-Don't tell me that--
-I want to see for myself

390
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,280
what kind of place that is.

391
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,620
Dong-cheol.

392
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,450
Are you crazy?

393
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,160
That place is too dangerous.
You can't go there alone.

394
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,930
Sang-hwan.

395
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,030
One of us

396
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,700
needs to know that place

397
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,770
in order to help her.

398
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,510
They all know your faces now.

399
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,380
So

400
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,910
I'll go.

401
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,400
Recite the salvation prayer.

402
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,800
If you do,

403
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,140
I'll give you the Spring water
of Salvation.

404
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,300
(POLICE)

405
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,250
Mr. Park, please open the door.

406
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,280
Mr. Cheon, I'm in trouble.

407
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,020
The police are in front of my door
with a warrant.

408
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,720
-They keep knocking on the door.
(-Open the door.)

409
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,690
Mr. Park, we'll open this
ourselves, then.

410
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,290
Sorry?

411
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,460
(Mr. Park Jeong-min!)

412
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,400
Are you serious?

413
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,310
Mr. Park Jeong-min.

414
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,240
Are you going to jump from up there?

415
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,550
Walk out through the door
unless you want a metal rod in your leg.

416
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,110
I'm doomed.

417
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,650
Let's talk about casting a net
for prospective believers.

418
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,820
First, you should carry the bible around,
wearing a cross pendant

419
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,720
most Christians wear.

420
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,460
Then say that you're new
to the area and want to attend church

421
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,260
to befriend people in the area.

422
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,870
I have a question.
Don't people think we're lying?

423
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,140
There's a line that goes like this
in "Book of Salvation".

424
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,440
"False or true,"

425
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,210
"no matter what means you use,"

426
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,610
"spreading Almighty's messages
is a joyous deed,"

427
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,680
"and it will continuously
delight Almighty."

428
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,150
Therefore, we don't call it lying.

429
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,030
Instead, we call it "Salvation Strategy".

430
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,060
If you use this strategy wisely,

431
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,000
you'll receive a big reward.

432
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,570
What we do here is

433
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,700
leading people to salvation through
our faith, which is a good deed.

434
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,470
Almighty will praise
our righteousness.

435
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,010
You all got that, right?

436
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,610
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

437
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,880
Let's wrap up today's class here.

438
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,780
We'll head out for our mission work
right away,

439
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,550
so please get ready.

440
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,450
-Yes, Apostle Kang.
-Yes, Apostle Kang.

441
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,020
Oh, Ms. Hong.

442
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Yes.

443
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,490
How long has it been
since you joined Guseonwon?

444
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,800
It's been just over a year.

445
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,630
I've been observing you.

446
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,570
From all the volunteer work
and seminars to the mission work,

447
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,940
you've been serving Almighty
most faithfully.

448
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,710
Both Spiritual Father and Almighty
are delighted with your work.

449
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,050
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

450
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,020
What is your wish, Ms. Hong?

451
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,220
It's getting on the Boat of Salvation,
of course.

452
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,490
If you want to make
that wish come true,

453
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,320
you should assist and
look after Spiritual Mother.

454
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,830
How do you feel about becoming her aide?

455
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,790
Her aide?

456
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,660
You'll work with Spiritual Mother
most closely out of all of us

457
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,030
and serve her as well as Spiritual Father.

458
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,830
Getting the position is a huge honor.

459
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,800
Can I really be given
such an important position?

460
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,810
I'll speak with Spiritual Father about it.

461
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,239
Will you accept the offer
with your faith?

462
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,179
Of course. Our wishes
will be fulfilled. I believe it.

463
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,350
Thank you very much, Apostle Kang.

464
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,560
Sang-mi.

465
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,600
If you memorize
the Prayer of Salvation,

466
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,270
you'll be able to get out of here.

467
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,580
I

468
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,449
won't give up.

469
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,020
You haven't learned your lesson.

470
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,950
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

471
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,780
-We believe it.
-We believe it.

472
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,450
Let's go. You should go this way.

473
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,560
Hey, guys.

474
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,230
Isn't this our first time coming
to a place like this together?

475
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,230
Hey, stop embarrassing us.
We're not here to hang out.

476
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,900
It looks like she's here alone.

477
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,110
And she happens to be reading
one of my favorite books.

478
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,210
-We'll probably click.
-Hey, be quiet.

479
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,710
Hey, Dong-cheol.
Yes, they're at the park now.

480
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,780
All right. Be careful.

481
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,480
Will we get started right away?

482
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,500
We're here to promote a concert
for those in their 20s and 30s.

483
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,230
Would you be able
to fill out this survey?

484
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm sorry.

485
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,340
Hello, excuse me.

486
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,410
Hello, we're here to promote

487
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,650
Gosh, the laces came undone again.

488
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,820
Excuse me.

489
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,150
Yes?

490
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,350
I'm sorry I startled you.

491
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,690
It's okay. What is it about?

492
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,130
We're here to promote a concert
for those in 20s and 30s.

493
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,430
We'd like to find out what young people
are concerned about nowadays.

494
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,130
If you fill out this survey,

495
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,230
you'll get a ticket to the concert
as well as a gift certificate.

496
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,270
Could you spare us a minute of your time?

497
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,670
I'm sorry.

498
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,270
My mom wants to have dinner with me today,

499
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,010
so I have to be home early today.

500
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,550
Today is her birthday.

501
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,050
We just need a minute.
They're simple questions.

502
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,320
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

503
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,690
-Gosh, it's so hot!
-Oh, no.

504
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,260
It's okay.

505
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,830
It's all right. I'll do it.

506
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,230
Goodness.

507
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,830
Dong-cheol,
you have such a pure heart.

508
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,230
Aren't I right, So-rin?

509
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Yes, you have such kind eyes.

510
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,010
Gosh, I'm flattered.

511
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,810
My mom always talks about
how weak they look.

512
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,650
Dong-cheol, do you think that
this world will exist eternally?

513
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,690
They say that nothing is eternal.

514
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,890
Then do you think that
we can be given eternal life?

515
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,700
Eternal life? I'm not sure.

516
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,260
Right?

517
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,400
You're not sure.

518
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,900
That's right.

519
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,740
What if someone is

520
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,740
willing to share the secret
to eternal life?

521
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,170
How will that make you feel?

522
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,110
-Is there such a thing?
-Of course.

523
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,010
Us crossing paths like this

524
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,010
wasn't a mere coincidence.

525
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,850
It means that you can
become the chosen one.

526
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,220
I can become the chosen one?

527
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,860
That's right. When you get chosen,

528
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,300
the secret to eternal life
will be revealed to you.

529
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,170
Well, you're not chosen yet,

530
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,200
but the possibility
opened up to you today.

531
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,540
It's a bit difficult to follow.

532
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,810
So-rin, could you explain to him
in easier terms?

533
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,080
Sure.

534
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,750
It doesn't look like this world
will ever come to an end,

535
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,580
but the end will come.

536
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,550
We call it "apocalypse".

537
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,750
But because people are only
preoccupied with the present,

538
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,760
they're not getting ready for it at all.

539
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,890
Totally. We should get ready for it.

540
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,390
Right? We need to be prepared.

541
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,500
When the time comes,
only the awakened ones who are prepared

542
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,230
can get on the Boat of Salvation.

543
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
The Boat of Salvation?

544
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,770
I've never heard of it.

545
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,840
Is he actually flirting with her or what?

546
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,840
Why is he taking so long?

547
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,180
That woman is so used to dealing
with people like that, you know.

548
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,850
She'll know if anything seems off.

549
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,520
If he buys it right away,

550
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,450
she'll figure it out,
so he's just being careful.

551
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,460
Dong-cheol must know.

552
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,290
Oh, it looks like they're done.

553
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,630
Yes, we're at the entrance of
the park by the intersection.

554
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,400
We met someone very special.

555
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,700
Okay, we'll wait there.

556
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,740
They're actually in the area.
They'll pick us up right away.

557
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,570
-It's perfect, isn't it?
-Yes, totally.

558
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,210
That works out perfectly.

559
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,120
Wear this.

560
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,150
Why?

561
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,990
They must have rules
about whom to approach.

562
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,660
I bet it comes down to money.

563
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,860
We need bait to catch a fish.

564
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,530
My mom gave it to me as a gift,
so don't lose it.

565
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,110
All right.

566
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,470
And

567
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,610
we'll also need a sign
only we can recognize.

568
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,750
A sign?

569
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,220
Hey, that's our cue.

570
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,350
Okay.

571
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,160
(GUSEONWON)

572
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,490
Please get in.

573
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,300
It's a hot day, isn't it?

574
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,960
Yes, it's scorching hot.

575
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,930
They'll go with us.

576
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,830
I see. It's nice to meet you all.

577
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,500
Guys, look. My goodness.

578
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,170
Dong-cheol is so brave.
He got on that van right away.

579
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,310
He's like Gutsy, you know.
He's always been that way.

580
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,050
From now on,
only happy days await all of you.

581
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,450
-Congratulations.
-I'm very happy to meet you all.

582
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,920
Welcome.

583
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,560
You have such a kind face.
What a nice watch.

584
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,490
Your family must be well-off.

585
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,660
By the way,

586
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,130
did you get your hair done
at a hair salon?

587
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,240
Sorry?

588
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
Why do you ask?

589
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:23,310
My gosh, your hairstyle is so unique.

590
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,720
Is it because you're young?
You're very straightforward.

591
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,420
I'm sorry if I was rude.

592
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,960
Not at all. I like that attitude.

593
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,800
(GUSEONWON)

594
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,130
You can get off now.

595
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,240
I didn't expect to see
such a huge building inside the mountains.

596
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,140
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

597
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,780
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

598
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,240
This is a holy spot.

599
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,650
It wards off demons.

600
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,350
-Sister So-rin.
-Yes.

601
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,020
Take your time and explain everything
about Guseonwon to them.

602
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,850
I'll see you all
in the chapel later.

603
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,950
Okay.

604
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,490
Then I'll see you guys later.

605
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,490
All right then. Please follow me.

606
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,900
Dong-cheol.

607
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,470
My, this place is so cool.

608
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,950
Gosh.

609
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,910
Why isn't he picking up?

610
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
Guys, let's go in.
We should wait inside.

611
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,790
-He'll be okay, right?
-Nothing will happen to him.

612
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,500
Let's go inside.

613
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,630
All right.

614
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,740
This is the main chapel.

615
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:05,410
-Spiritual Father gives us love
-I love you

616
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,950
Everyone, we have

617
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,590
a few new brethren visiting us
here at Guseonwon today.

618
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,350
Shall we welcome them
with a big round of applause?

619
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,800
Welcome!

620
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,640
Shall we bless each other
before we get started?

621
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,940
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

622
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,440
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!
-Our wishes will be fulfilled!

623
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,680
We believe it.

624
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,610
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

625
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,410
These chosen brethren

626
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,350
to get on the Boat of Salvation
with us were sent to us

627
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,590
by Almighty and Spiritual Father.

628
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,650
Let's express our gratitude to them
with a round of applause.

629
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,730
We welcome you all.

630
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,100
Welcome to Guseonwon.

631
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,080
Welcome.

632
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,680
(JEONG-HUN)

633
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,550
Why isn't Dong-cheol picking up?

634
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,060
Stop calling him. What will you do
if something happens to him?

635
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,660
Hey, what if those jerks figured it out?

636
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,100
They might whack him.

637
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,500
It's not like they're thugs.

638
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,200
You're so clueless.

639
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,600
They're much more ruthless than thugs.

640
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,940
Haven't you seen it on TV?

641
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,910
Some of them
beat people up and kill them.

642
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,070
Some cults even bury people alive.
What if that place is one of them?

643
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,010
Stop making ominous remarks, will you?

644
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,810
Well, I was just saying

645
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,220
we should be prepared
for the worse-case scenario.

646
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,550
Guys, I'll be right back.

647
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
Where are you going?

648
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,660
-I have to meet someone.
-Who?

649
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,630
I'll tell you guys later.
Call me if Dong-cheol gets back.

650
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,760
All right.

651
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,930
Get home safely.

652
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,400
-Take care.
-Goodbye.

653
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,370
Dong-cheol.

654
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,280
Why are you leaving?

655
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,120
We're having tea with the new brethren.
Please join us.

656
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,620
Oh, right. You said your mom wants you
to come home early today.

657
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,260
Yes, it's her birthday today.

658
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,120
Right, you said that.

659
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,430
How about you bring her here?
We'll throw a birthday party for her.

660
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,630
-What do you think?
-Well

661
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,930
I think I should head home now.

662
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,240
I'm really sorry.

663
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,610
Don't be.

664
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,540
We have a service scheduled for tomorrow.
I'll see you then.

665
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:49,880
Tomorrow?

666
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:13,100
Sang-jin?

667
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,270
Sang-mi.

668
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,010
Sang-jin.

669
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,480
Is it really you?

670
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,350
I'm sorry.
This must be so hard for you.

671
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,890
No, don't worry.

672
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,630
I'm fine.

673
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,570
Sang-mi, I know that you can
get through this.

674
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,770
So stay strong for just a little longer.

675
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,070
You can do it.

676
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,240
Okay.

677
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,680
I'll be sure to do it.

678
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,320
I'll make sure

679
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,720
that I can get out of here

680
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,890
and go back out into the world.

681
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,800
Good.

682
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,260
Sang-jin.

683
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,780
I'll do it my way too.

684
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,920
Everyone who is considered
influential in Muji

685
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,390
is affiliated with that cult.

686
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,030
It's safe to assume that everyone
in the prosecution and police

687
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,030
has a connection
with the leader of the cult.

688
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,970
I know.

689
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,510
If the police weren't
under Guseonwon's control,

690
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,780
I wouldn't ask Dad for help.

691
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,350
Your dad?

692
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,050
Then why did you want to see me?

693
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,820
Because I can't

694
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,120
trust Dad.

695
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,260
And you can trust me?

696
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,130
I don't trust you either.

697
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,430
-Then what is this about?
-I know

698
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,940
that Dad is planning
on running for provincial governor.

699
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,540
If I disclose the relationship
between you and him,

700
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,940
it'll ruin the upcoming election for him.

701
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,610
What are you trying to do now?

702
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,410
I'm asking you for a favor in a way
that you won't be able to refuse.

703
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,990
Whom do you think people will
believe more between you

704
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,860
and your dad?

705
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,160
Muji-gun is such a small place.

706
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,200
Whether people believe it or not,
the word will spread.

707
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,270
He'll sort out the situation at all costs

708
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,940
to get elected as provincial governor.

709
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,410
Do you think he'll give up everything

710
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,340
and choose you?

711
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,910
-This sounds like a threat.
-You have to

712
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,950
help me out.

713
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,730
Hello.

714
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,760
-You're Dong-cheol, right?
-Yes.

715
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,130
I'll give you a ride. Hop on.

716
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,870
It's a long walk to the bus station.

717
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,740
I'd appreciate that, but...

718
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,070
It's okay.

719
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,310
We have to go to the market anyway.
Please get in.

720
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,450
-Are you sure?
-Yes, of course.

721
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,310
Thank you.

722
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,050
By the way, how did you hurt
your face like that?

723
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,790
You mean this?

724
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,890
I fell on my face when I was drunk.

725
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,890
Oh, no.

726
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,760
By the way, have you been living here
for a long time?

727
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,530
I think it's been about a year.

728
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,200
I moved here.

729
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,100
I see.

730
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,910
Can I ask why you decided to move here?

731
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,710
My dad wanted to live somewhere quiet.

732
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,080
I guess he's burnt out
from running his business.

733
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,550
What kind of business is it?

734
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,990
Don't worry. It's totally fine.
Go ahead and answer it.

735
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:06,330
Thank you.

736
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,770
(Hey, why didn't you call us?
We were so worried.)

737
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,110
-I'll call you back later--
(-Hey, cut it out.)

738
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,940
(We've been waiting for you all day long.
Why didn't you call us?)

739
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,910
Darn it. I'll pay you back, okay?

740
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,380
Gosh, how can you treat
your friend like this?

741
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,120
(Hey, what are you talking about now?)

742
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,420
Hey, don't you know how well
my dad's business is doing these days?

743
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:39,430
Are you really going to be like this
over a few thousand dollars?

744
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,130
Cut it out, okay?

745
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,200
I'll tell my dad to send you
the money right away.

746
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,530
I have to go.

747
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,440
I didn't want to ask Dad for help
because it'd hurt my pride.

748
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,470
What a pathetic loser.

749
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,180
I was too loud, wasn't I?

750
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,950
Gosh, don't worry.
It's totally fine.

751
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,420
By the way, it sounds like
your dad's business

752
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,420
is very successful.

753
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:13,830
My dad?

754
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,600
No, it's just a small business.

755
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,670
What did he say?

756
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,370
Has he gone crazy?

757
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,570
He talked about money
and some kind of a business.

758
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,070
He must be still with them.

759
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,310
Oh, you're right.

760
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,180
I told you to stop calling him.

761
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,780
I was just worried about him.

762
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,150
If this goes wrong, it's all on you.

763
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,920
-Why would it be my fault?
-Because it is.

764
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,650
I called him because I was worried...
I'm speechless.

765
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,660
Fine. Blame this finger, then.
I dialed him with it.

766
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,160
-Do you want to break it or what?
-Yes, I will.

767
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,890
-Come here.
-I was just kidding. Gosh.

768
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,730
What the heck are you idiots
doing right now?

769
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,760
Can you please stop swearing so much?

770
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,430
It's not like I come here
to get cursed at...

771
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,100
What's that?
Isn't it an assorted skewer platter?

772
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,240
I love skewers.

773
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,070
Ma'am.

774
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,010
Have you lost your mind?

775
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,310
sister

776
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,550
What? Why did you call me?

777
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:12,720
That's right.Sister,come on.

778
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,790
Your skewers are the most delicious food
on this planet.

779
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,590
Aren't I right? Yes.

780
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,690
Sister,you're the best.

781
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,460
All right, fine. Eat up, guys.

782
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,370
Nicely done. Eat up.

783
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,650
It's good.

784
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,920
(GUSEONWON)

785
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,850
Oh, right. Wait, Dong-cheol.

786
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,250
What's your number?

787
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,360
Give me your phone.
I'll punch it in for you.

788
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,560
Sure.

789
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,500
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

790
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,100
-Here.
-Great.

791
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,900
I'll call you tomorrow, then.

792
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,340
That's my number.
Please make sure you save it.

793
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,310
I'm Apostle Jo Wan-tae.

794
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,680
Apostle Jo.

795
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,410
Yes. I'll see you here tomorrow.

796
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,580
-Okay. See you.
-I love you.

797
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,940
Hey, it's me.

798
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:41,870
Where are you guys?

799
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:47,980
Do you guys think you live here or what?

800
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,280
Day or night,
all you guys do is fool around.

801
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:51,650
A pint of beer, please.

802
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:53,950
Dong-cheol.

803
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,690
Where's Sang-mi? Did you see her?

804
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,990
No, I didn't.

805
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:03,100
Does that mean she's locked up?

806
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,530
Did you see anything weird
or spooky?

807
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,900
I was quite surprised.

808
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,810
The people there
actually looked happy.

809
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,180
Don't let them fool you.

810
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,340
They look like nice people on the outside,

811
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,910
but they're all rotten inside.

812
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:23,880
All right.

813
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,680
Well

814
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,490
I'm supposed to see them again tomorrow.

815
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,690
I should be able to find something
if I go back there.

816
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,030
But

817
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,560
don't you guys think
this is too dangerous?

818
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,730
It's a good thing
that we're trying to help her,

819
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,430
but we should think about our safety too.

820
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,370
Just don't turn on your live broadcast.

821
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:43,940
That's what you can do to help us.

822
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,720
Here. You should eat.

823
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,620
Trying to fight off the demons

824
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,460
has weakened you so much.

825
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,200
I thought about it all night,

826
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,500
and I realized that I tried
to run away every time.

827
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,480
I won't run away anymore though.

828
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:58,880
I'll be sure

829
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,510
to destroy that place.

830
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:24,640
Good.

831
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,240
You're doing very well.

832
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,910
"Your patience"

833
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,210
"will earn you a new life."

834
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,550
Sang-mi.

835
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,390
Now, recite
the Prayer of Salvation

836
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,990
for me.

837
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,260
"You are"

838
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,330
"the King of our paradise,"

839
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,870
"our creator,"

840
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,900
"and the absolute true love."

841
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,140
"I confess all of my sins to you"

842
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,040
"and give you my everything."

843
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,350
"Almighty."

844
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:12,150
"Please allow me
to be in the light of your glory."

845
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:17,620
"With my utmost gratitude,"

846
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,230
"I will serve you"

847
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:25,330
"and Spiritual Father."

848
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,730
"I give you"

849
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,970
"all of my heart."

850
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,610
"My love."

"My salvation."

00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,950
"Our wishes"

853
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,320
"will be fulfilled."

854
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,750
Hello?

855
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,650
(Your dad wants to see you.)

856
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,680
(Come to the sanitarium.)

(GUSEONWON SANITARIUM)

858
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,610
You'll wear it

859
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,810
at the announcement ceremony
during the service today.

860
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,480
Try it on.

861
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,720
After Spiritual Father's announcement,

862
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,290
you'll receive training
to become Spiritual Mother.

863
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,790
Then you'll have a spiritual wedding.

864
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,960
That's why it's important for you
to take great care of yourself.

865
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,460
Come on. Go ahead and try it on.

866
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,310
Ms. Kim, what do you think?

867
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,150
Spiritual Mother looks exquisite.

868
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,290
How beautiful.

869
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,190
You're stunning.

870
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,230
Mom.

871
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,040
Mom.

872
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,550
Don't worry.

873
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:56,680
You and I

874
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,920
will be happy again

875
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,350
like we used to be.

876
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,830
Thank you for coming all the way here.

877
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,140
Sang-hwan, you made it.

878
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,440
That's my son.

879
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:37,790
Your son has such a pure soul.

880
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,620
