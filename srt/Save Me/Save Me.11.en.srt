Thank you for coming all the way here.

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,460
Sang-hwan, you're here.

34

Say hello. He's the pastor of Guseonwon.

38
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,750
Dad, that man

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,790
isn't a pastor. He's a cult leader.

40
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,490
Stop. That's rude of you.

41
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,930
I'm sorry. He's still immature.

42
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,530
It's fine.

43

Your name is Sang-hwan, right?

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,640
I'm just a cleric who spreads
the word of salvation

46

He said he would

47
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,810
take better care of your friend
you told me about.

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,510
As I hear, she's a girl with an illness

49
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,680
and a wounded heart.

50
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,650
Your father also asked people
at the welfare division to help her.

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,790
Don't worry.

52
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,560
Dad.

53
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,790
You did the same thing three years ago.

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,360
I asked you to help out my innocent friend

55
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,600
because he was about to go to jail
for not having money or connections.

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,770
You turned away from him
to be elected as the governor!

57
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,570
What is it this time?

58
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,810
A provincial governor?
A congressman?

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,740
-That's enough.
-When I was little,

60
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,880
you told me that someone like you
who has power

61
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,820
should help the weak and the poor!

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,150
That man locked up a girl who is
young enough to be your daughter

63
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,520
to make a pass at her.

64
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,860
Han Sang-hwan! Don't say such a thing
when you don't know anything.

65
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,430
Dad. Are you willing

66
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,900
to join hands with a cult leader now?

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,270
How could you stop so low?

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,800
You brat!

69
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,170
Gosh, Pastor Baek. I'm sorry.

70
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,480
My foolish son made a big mistake.

71
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,280
I apologize on behalf of him.

72
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,010
Don't worry.

74

Almighty does not turn away from

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,690
the weak and the poor.

76
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,430
That's why he entrusted me with Sang-mi.

77
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,070
Please trust me, and believe in Almighty.

you're all the same.

81
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,550
It's fine, Brother Wan-deok.

82
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,060
Is there something else
you want to say to me?

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,460
I'm warning you.

84
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,390
If you do so much as
lay a finger on my friend,

85
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,100
I will make you regret it.

86
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,570
Do you like Sang-mi, Sang-hwan?

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,470
What nonsense are you talking?

88
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,310
I'm just talking about your feelings.

89
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,480
Just like how you can't hide
your feelings towards her,

90
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,420
Almighty can't hide his affection
towards her either.

91
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,450
So please don't misunderstand us.

92
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,430
We care about Sang-mi more than anyone.

93
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,130
The problem is Sang-mi doesn't like

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,600
you or the Almighty you're referring to.

95
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,310
I hope you'll calm down your anger
and visit us.

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,590
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-We believe it.

166
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,960
-All of you will be purified
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

167
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,000
from your filthy sins.
Do you all believe it?

168
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,930
-We believe it!
-We believe it!

169
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,770
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.
-Our wishes will be fulfilled.

170
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,740
You can go down now.

171
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,740
Okay.

172
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,570
Stay out of it.

173
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,140
Weren't you locked up in the youth
detention center three years ago?

174
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,410
Who are you?

175
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,820
(SPIRITUAL FATHER'S OFFICE)

176
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,080
(WE BLESS AND WELCOME YOU,
RECEPTION FOR NEW BELIVERS)

177
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,870
Please have a seat.

178
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,280
There are some things
I need to talk to you about in preparation

179
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,680
for the upcoming spiritual wedding.

180
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,420
Everyone, from myself and apostles

181
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,650
to all of our believers,

182
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,990
must abstain from eating meat from now on.

183
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,590
We can only eat

184
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,760
clean, raw white rice.

185
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,030
We must purify our blood

186
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,370
before welcoming Spiritual Mother.

187
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,730
Do you all understand?

188
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,570
-Yes, Spiritual Father.
-Yes, Spiritual Father.

189
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,740
I'll wait for Almighty's message

190
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,480
to reschedule the date for the wedding.

191
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,780
So please make sure that
you can be ready at all times.

192
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,120
You two apostles should make sure

193
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,460
that Sang-mi can be in her purest,
cleanest state spiritually.

194
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,819
We'll make sure, Spiritual Father.

195
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,430
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

196
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,230
All right then. You may leave now.

197
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,510
Here are some things I think you should
include in your next sermon.

198
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,180
Since we're welcoming Spiritual Mother,

199
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,210
it would be nice if you could help me

200
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,350
map out what we can do to collect
special offerings for the occasion.

201
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,420
It's a very special event, you know.

202
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,060
But we haven't collected
as much as I was expecting.

203
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,160
Here.

204
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,370
"Since we're welcoming Spiritual Mother,"

205
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,840
"we must now get rid of
all materialistic things"

206
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,610
"that blind us and weigh down our hearts"

207
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,910
"in order to get on the Boat of Salvation"

208
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,710
"with a light heart and clean soul."

209
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,720
Well, that's the gist of it.

210
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,720
But we both know how good you are
at editing sentences.

211
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,290
You'll do it, right?

212
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,460
I should get back to work,
Spiritual Father.

213
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,690
Those who conceal Almighty's glory

214
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,790
will perish in fire

215
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,000
on the day of judgment.

216
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,490
I believe in Almighty who has prepared

217
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,430
the Boat of Salvation and allowed us

218
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,260
to ready ourselves
for the day of judgement.

219
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,200
"The one who believes in me will
live, even though they die."

220
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,200
"And whoever lives"

221
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,040
"by believing in me will never die."
I believe in your words.

222
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,800
You are now

223
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,170
the body of Almighty.

224
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,940
No one

225
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,580
will be able to stand against you.

226
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,410
Sang-jin.

227
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,720
I've been waiting for you all day.

228
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,380
You should come home straight from school.

229
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,250
Where have you been?

230
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,620
Ms. Kim.

231
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,760
Don't leave me alone.

232
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,260
Mom.

233
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,300
Why are you here?

234
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,870
Sang-mi.

235
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,900
This is too dangerous.
You should leave now.

236
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,510
Sang-mi,
let's get out of here together.

237
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,080
No.

238
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,250
It's not the time yet.

239
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,850
Let's go.

240
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,120
You should be in the sanitarium, not here.

241
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,590
Okay.

242
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,590
Sang-mi.

243
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,870
Is it you, Spiritual Mother?

244
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,670
I'm okay. Hurry up and go.

245
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,050
I guess your mother came
to hear Spiritual Father's sermon.

246
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,420
Yes, Apostle Kang.

247
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,620
Please take good care of
Sang-jin and Sang-mi.

248
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,100
Of course. Please don't worry.

249
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:13,170
(THE BOAT OF SALVATION WILL SAVE YOU)

250
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,530
By the way,

251
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,060
I guess the one who always
drives this van isn't here today.

252
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,370
Gosh, you have a keen eye, Dong-cheol.

253
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,100
You said you invest in stocks.
I guess it's because you're smart.

254
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,380
It's not that.
He just has a very large build.

255
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,980
He went to run some errands.

256
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,080
We're looking for someone.

257
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,520
Do you have any friends

258
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,150
who often go around riding a motorcycle?

259
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,520
Every kid in this town rides motorcycles.

260
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,160
Why are you looking for them?

261
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,930
Do you have any friends like that?

262
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,870
No, I'm just curious.

263
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,570
They left without a contact number
after doing something good.

264
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,640
We'd like to return their favor.

265
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,550
Gosh, they must have done
something really good.

266
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,920
Yes.

267
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,920
I hope we find them soon.

268
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,100
We're here.

269
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
See you tomorrow.

270
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,470
Thank you.

271
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,110
Listen. We have a seminar tomorrow,

272
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,680
so you'll have a chance to ask questions.

273
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,780
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

274
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,450
-Dong-cheol.
-Yes?

275
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,950
I really hope you'll come tomorrow.

276
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,150
Okay.

277
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,650
See you tomorrow.

278
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,130
Please drive safely.

279
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,170
Who are you?

280
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,540
I'm a reporter. I'm collecting news
about this cult under cover.

281
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,180
(I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CAME HERE,)

282
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,850
(BUT DO NOT COME BACK
TO THIS PLACE.)

283
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,160
Goodness. He really is a crazy man.

284
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,090
Have you gone crazy too?
Why did you go there?

285
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,330
He's right, you crazy punk.

286
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,530
Listen.

287
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,170
I think

288
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,040
my dad joined hands with that cult leader.

289
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,640
That's why I wanted to see it for myself.

290
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,780
I wanted to bring everything
that can be evidence.

291
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm sorry.

292
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,590
It's fine.

293
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,760
Whatever your dad does,

294
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,030
you're not going to run away, right?

295
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,040
Jeong-hun.

296
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,410
I want you to broadcast the video
of the cult leader I filmed.

297
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,640
I thought about it.
If my dad is on the same side with him,

298
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,910
no one including the police
and the press will believe us.

299
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,780
We have to show it

300
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,420
directly to people
and make them believe us.

301
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,590
Okay. I got it.

302
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,770
(GUSEONWON)

303
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,110
All right, it's done.

304
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,550
Oh, here.

305
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,950
A woman at Guseonwon gave me this.

306
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,350
What is it?

307
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,460
"I don't know why you're here,
but don't ever come back."

308
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,890
My gosh, what is this?

309
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,060
I just know that she's
an undercover journalist.

310
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,060
-She's a journalist?
-Yes.

311
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,000
"Don't ever come back"? Do you think
this is a warning or a threat?

312
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,300
I guess I'll find out after
I ask her in person.

313
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,470
Anyway, these guys don't seem like
an ordinary cult.

314
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,710
And that cult leader seems scarier
than we thought he would be.

315
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,080
You should be careful, Dong-cheol.

316
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,050
You should be careful.

317
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,120
The same goes for you guys too.

318
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,750
The curly haired guy's looking
all over the place for you two.

319
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,550
Okay, let's all be careful.

320
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,790
I'll check

321
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:59,290
if that journalist is someone
we can trust and rely on.

322
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,130
I'll also look into what these guys did
before they came to Muji.

323
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,600
I have to go now.

324
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,040
Why? Let's grab a drink.

325
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,540
I have somewhere I need to go.

326
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,940
See you guys tomorrow.

327
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,340
He's always so busy.

328
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,850
What's

329
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,250
your identity?

330
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,820
Pardon?

331
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,120
-Well
-I saw everything.

332
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,220
You stopped that guy earlier
from trying to help me.

333
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,100
I don't understand what you're saying.

334
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,270
Spiritual Mother, Apostle Kang
asked me to do something

335
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,350
Do you really believe that

336
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,380
you can get on the Boat of Salvation
by staying here?

337
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,450
Do you really believe

338
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,560
everything that the so-called
"Spiritual Father" says to you?

339
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,130
I really don't understand what you mean.

340
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,760
You already know everything.

341
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,000
You know that

342
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,400
this place is all fake.

343
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,240
Why are you pretending like
you don't know anything?

344
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,410
Isn't it worse to pretend like

345
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,810
you don't know anything when you do?

346
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,190
Why do you think

347
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,760
I'm pretending like I don't know anything?

348
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,790
Because you also seemed to be

349
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,460
observing this place, just like me.

350
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,070
Then I finally realized
when you asked me that question

351
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,170
at the nursing home.

352
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,040
You should run away.

353
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,940
If you stay here,
your body and soul will die.

354
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,110
Then why aren't you leaving?

355
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,810
That question.

356
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,650
I've been asking that question
so many times.

357
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,920
"Why didn't you leave?"

358
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,790
I've been here for over four years,

359
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,230
but nobody ever asked me that question.

360
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,740
You're right.
I don't believe this place.

361
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,950
Do you really not

362
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,520
believe this place?

363
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,260
No.

364
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,160
To be honest,

365
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,460
I'm a journalist.

366
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,600
I couldn't find anything weird
about this place from outside.

367
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,740
So I've disguised myself
as a believer to collect information.

368
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,210
These people never leave
any kind of evidence behind.

369
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,910
I've only recently managed to

370
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,950
get close to finding anything.

371
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,720
Then

372
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,360
I'll help you from now on.

373
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,690
What?

374
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,630
I'm going to destroy this place
no matter what.

375
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,760
So you should help me too.

376
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,830
Are you sure about this?

377
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,170
I have friends who are trying to help me.

378
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,110
Now, I also have you too.

379
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,710
Okay.

380
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,510
I'll do my best to help you.

381
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,120
Spiritual Mother, please deliver
my prayers to Spiritual Father.

382
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,220
-Please deliver it to him.
-Sister So-rin.

383
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
How dare you cause a scene in front
of our future Spiritual Mother?

384
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,160
You can't cheat like this.

385
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,060
She's right. Spiritual Mother.

386
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,700
-Don't listen to her prayers.
-She's right.

387
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,640
Our Almighty told us

388
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,040
not to ignore the prayers of the weak.

389
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,310
You can tell me anything you want as well.

390
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,620
I'll deliver your prayers
to Spiritual Father.

391
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,719
Spiritual Mother.

392
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,429
I have a son.

393
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,360
And he's

394
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,969
Spiritual Mother, please help my mother.

395
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,639
Please help me save my son.

396
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,540
-Spiritual Mother.
-My goodness.

397
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,510
Dong-cheol.

398
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,150
What?

399
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,360
Thanks.

400
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,960
And I'm sorry for making you go to
that dangerous place

401
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,700
all alone.

402
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,540
Do you know

403
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,640
what I hate hearing from you?

404
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,240
I hate it when you say sorry.

405
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,590
To be honest, it wasn't your fault.

406
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,120
The reason why you, Sang-mi,
and I turned out this way

407
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,160
is all because of adults.

408
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,700
I thought

409
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,140
my mom would be able to wake up
if my dad became the governor.

410
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,240
I was foolish.

411
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,580
Sang-hwan.

412
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,050
Do you remember what you said to me

413
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,020
when I got expelled from school,

414
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,790
and when you stopped
the prisoner bus?

415
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,560
I said, "Stand tall."

416
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,980
What's going on?
Shouldn't we go check on her?

417
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,940
My gosh, just leave her be.

418
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,680
Honey, please help me.

419
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,420
You'll only end up getting
your hair pulled out.

420
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,350
-She'll tell you to save her son.
-You're right. Let's go.

421
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,460
(-Please help.)
-Let's go. Hurry.

422
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,930
Honey. Sang-mi.

423
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,460
Sang-mi.

424
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,740
Apostle Im, is this your first time
coming here?

425
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,740
Yes.

426
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,050
This will make you become
an important apostle.

427
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,010
This is a great blessing for you.

428
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,280
Our wishes will be fulfilled.
I believe it.

429
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,690
This place is filled with evil spirits.

430
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,460
I see.

431
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,060
-Now, let's go inside.
-Okay.

432
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,650
Can you smell the stench of the devil?

433
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,480
Yes, I can.

434
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,650
Come this way.

435
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,660
Help me.

436
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,960
Please help me.

437
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,730
After getting possessed by the devil,

438
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,170
he lead our believers to abandon
their faith for Almighty.

439
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,600
He's one of the worst.

440
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,010
I I'm sorry.

441
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
What are you sorry about?

442
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,850
I dared

443
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,220
I dared to

444
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,020
doubt your power, Spiritual Father.

445
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,620
You are the only one

446
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,260
who can lead us to salvation.

447
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,060
The act of using your words
to seduce, deceive,

448
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,230
and make people arrogant

449
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,000
is the devil's

450
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,200
clever scheme.

451
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,520
No...

452
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,490
Spiritual Father.

453
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,470
You nasty devil!

454
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:15,010
I order you to leave
from the body of my precious child!

455
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,590
Look carefully.

456
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,330
His sins have gathered together
and solidified

457
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,700
in his stomach.

458
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,400
When I lay my hands on a sinner,

459
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,670
the pain that he or she will feel

460
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,270
will be proportional to their sin.

461
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,120
Apostle Im, why don't you

462
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,290
pray for the sinners today?

463
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,960
Me?

464
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,400
From now on, I would like you to

465
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,070
be in charge of this place

466
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,070
and help us get rid of the devil.

467
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,410
But isn't this position

468
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,140
only given to the most
spiritually awakened apostle?

469
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,480
You're the most spiritually awakened.

470
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,620
Pardon?

471
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,150
You gave

472
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,960
what's most precious to you

473
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,660
to our Almighty.

474
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,000
Don't you agree,

475
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,400
Apostle Kang?

476
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,410
Yes, you're right.
He gave our Almighty

477
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,050
his beloved daughter.

478
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,610
-Apostle Im.
-Yes?

479
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,780
You should pray for him.

480
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,880
Okay.

481
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,560
You nasty devil.

482
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,930
I call you out under the name
of our Almighty!

483
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,010
I call you out with the power
of our Almighty!

484
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,150
I give you this order under the name
of our Almighty.

485
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,080
I order you to confess your sin!

486
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,250
I command you to return to the fiery pit!

487
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,710
What?

488
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,080
Come in, and eat dinner.

489
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,390
(Our dear Sister Park Bong-hui here)

490
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:19,190
(made a special offering
to Almighty today)

491
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,330

Is he your friend?

493
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,500
I made you dinner.
You should eat before you go to work.

494
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,440
Where are you going again?

495
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,840
Jin-cheol's mother asked me
to help her with something again.

496
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,480
Did you borrow money from someone?

497
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,380
Why are you working so much these days?

498

What are you talking about?
That's nonsense.

499

don't ask weird people for help.

501

Just ask me. Okay?

502
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,860
Okay.

your dad became an apostle in charge
to get rid of evil spirits.

Do you know what that is?

That position is given to

510
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,740
the most faithful person in Guseonwon.

511
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,380
It wasn't given to Apostle Kang.

512

It was given to me.

I was given the position

And

515
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,890
Sang-mi will soon become
our Spiritual Mother.

516
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,460
Then our whole family

will all be able to get on

some policemen over.

Don't bother.
We can't blame these ignorant people.

by Senator Park.

I thought I was the president of Muji.

actually becoming the president.

Hey.

Where's Dong-cheol?

539
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,830
He's getting changed.

540
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,130
I see.

541
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,170
Did you find anything out?

542
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,410
They have a nursing home,

543
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,140
and they do a lot of volunteer work.

544

I could only find positive articles
about them.

I can't believe he even has
the police and reporters on his side.

But then again, what can't you do
with money these days?

547

I'd like to let you know that not
all policemen are like that.

Yes, okay. I know your dad's
not that kind of person.

550
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,300
Yes, of course.
He just doesn't do his work properly.

Hey, Dong-cheol.

You may know already,
but those guys are really clever.

557

They act like they're a legal community,

558
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,150
but all the critical evidence will
all be hidden inside.

559
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,890
You got in there with your guts,

you'll have to turn in your cell phones
whenever you come here.

570

It's just like how you don't wear anything
in a public bathhouse.

Why are you giving me your cell phone?

574
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,030
Sang-mi told me.

575
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,900
I heard the believers there aren't allowed
to use cell phones.

576
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:54,770
They always kept an eye on Sang-mi
and even locked her up.

577
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,440
So they probably have strict regulations.

00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:41,470
What is Prayer of Purification?

651
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:44,510
It's a ritual where you cleanse yourself

652
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,510
of any worldly filth that is left.

653
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,150
All right then. Shall we read
"Book of Salvation" now?

654
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,620
Hello.

655
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:04,200
May I ask you something?

656
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,600
Go.

657
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,070
This is Living Water blessed
by Spiritual Father.

658
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,250
You must put your hands in the water

659
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,880
and confess all of your sins to Almighty

660
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,550
in order to cleanse your soul.

661
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,430
Stir once

662
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,000
and say, "Please forgive my sin."

663
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,700
Do it.

664
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,910
Almighty,

665
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,420
I doubted that you're my savior

666
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,520
and said that you're fake.

667
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:05,160
Please forgive my sin.

668
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,470
I resented my dad for bringing

669
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,300
my family here.

670
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,840
Please forgive my sin.

671
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,310
Good. Keep going.

672
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,850
I resented and hated Apostle Kang Eun-sil
who's in front of me now.

673
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,560
Please forgive my sin.

674
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,530
I said that Apostle Jo Wan-deok
is a murderer.

675
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,700
Please forgive my sin.

676
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,100
I thought that everyone here was insane.

677
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,410
Please forgive my sin.

678
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,480
Sang-mi.

679
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,120
Is the training going well?

680
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,420
Is Mom doing okay?

681
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,760
She didn't look well
the last time I saw her.

682
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,360
Apostle Kang is doing her best

683
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,670
to take great care of her,
so you don't need to worry about her.

684
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,470
Oh, she actually just left
to go to the sanitarium again.

685
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,150
Mom.

686
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,520
Is it you, Sang-jin?

687
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,120
Sang-jin!

688
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,560
Where do you think you're going?
Let's have some fun.

689
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:52,200
Don't you know that you'll never
be able to get out of here?

690
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,700
Sang-jin! Sang-jin, help me.
Sang-jin!

691
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,640
Sang-jin!

692
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,840
Mom!

693
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,540
Sang-jin.

694
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,450
You need to get out of here
for Sang-mi to live, so please...

695
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,020
Please save Sang-mi.

696
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,420
Sang-mi.

697
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,520
Sang-mi!

698
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,170
No No, Sang-mi.

699
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,400
Sang-jin! Help me, Sang-jin.

700
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,370
Come to your senses, Mom!
You have to get out of here.

701
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,140
Sister Kim.

702
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,880
Sang-mi!

703
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,260
The most precious thing

704
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,890
will be harvested.

705
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,130
Three years have passed,
yet you still

706
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,030
have downy hair like a baby.

707
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,210
You should drink a lot of water.

708
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,850
Sang-mi.

709
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,420
Sang-mi.

710
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,550
Sang-mi.

711
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,720
Sang-mi, you should run away.

712
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,190
Run.

713
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:35,820
Sang-mi

714
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:28,210
(SAVE ME)

715
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,310
It's burning hot.

716
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:37,420
If you keep neglecting all the resentment
and sorrow in your heart,

717
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,190
you'll end up burning

718
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:45,060
yourself as well as
everything around you.

719
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,590
So now, you should

720
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:51,000
surrender everything to Almighty.

721
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,000
How do I do that?

722
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,910
What should I do

723
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,310
to surrender my everything to Almighty?
