Give me Megu back!

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,360
I'll give you a little after-sales service.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,080
You killed Megumi-san

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,710
and tried to go on with your life as if nothing had happened, right?

6
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,600
These are about to be settled, too.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,010
But, Yuu-san...

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,100
We need a plot to a story...

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,100
Stop peeking at them like you're some hot shot.

Yuu-san.

I'll put you in that jar, too.

13
00:01:08,157 --> 00:01:11,057

14
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:17,955

00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,700
You...

19
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,100
You died earlier!

20
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:05,173
What are you?

21
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:06,673
What kind of creature are you?

22
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:08,732
Why should that matter?

23
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:11,507
What's the purpose of it?

24
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:15,673
Fighting and killing each other in a dumpster like this...

25
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:17,800
What's the meaning of it?

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Do you need meaning or purpose?

27
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,100
That's what humans do.

28
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,300
Humans instinctively hurt others, make threats,

29
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,223
and bully those who appear weak.

30
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:33,048
Humans take pleasure in seeing them struggle.

31
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,149
That's a lie.

32
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,900
Normal people don't do that.

33
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,600
That's only when they happen to be peaceful.

34
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,500
But once humans fall into a trap, they're bound to change.

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,880
Come on, it's dangerous! You'll kill him.

36
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,930
Get off me!

37
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,600
There's no shortage of traps in this world.

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,300
Poverty, loneliness, disasters, epidemics, and even wars...

39
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,223
Human history is a history of violence.

40
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,557
Since the birth of the human race,

41
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:37,192
the era without wars in history is less than 10%.

42
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,323
Now, Yuu-san.

43
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,723
Now, the bugs are going to fly to you.

44
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:48,223
Where is that sound of wings coming from?

45
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:50,400
From across the sea?

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
Or are they coming from inside you?

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,130
You'll never be the same again, Yuu-san.

48
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:02,690
Because you're my greatest masterpiece from now on.

49
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,917
I felt that he just seemed like an ordinary man in his 20s.

50
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:00,400
He didn't talk much, but he wasn't dark.

51
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,300
He must've gotten stressed out somewhere.

52
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,307
He suddenly hit me and I wanted to report him, but the boss stopped me...

53
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,600
Was the boss victimized by him?

54
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,040
Put him to death, Detective!

55
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,073
Yuu has an older brother.

56
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:21,700
He's disabled, and we need money...

57
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,500
So we were completely dependent on Yuu.

58
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:33,006
It's because of me. This is all my fault!

59
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,231
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:38,265
Sorry, but it's time to go to the hospital.

00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:41,300
Oka-san*.
(*Someone else's mother or your own mother)

62
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,800
Oka-san, it's okay.

63
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,266
If your son is innocent, we'll clearly uncover the truth.

64
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,100
Matsui Yuu-san, how are you feeling?

65
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:26,373
Today, based on what we've learned from our investigation so far,

66
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:29,339
add the truth you know, please.

67
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:35,340
About the shared house called "Ark"...

68
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,700
It's been closed for quite some time.

69
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,900
The owner of the land and the building lives overseas

70
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,673
and the place has been abandoned.

71
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,900
So these people here...

72
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,400
They illegally occupied there for three months.

73
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Also, they recruited tenants on a whim.

74
00:07:57,406 --> 00:08:03,406
We found a large amount of blood and bodies in the building.

75
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:06,750
As you can see, 11 people, including you...

76
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,300
Their identities have all been confirmed.

77
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,300
And now we get to the main point.

78
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,889
These six people stayed there around the same time as you.

79
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:21,289
And they have something in common.

80
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:29,583
They committed murder, or they were believed to do so.

81
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:34,573
Yamaguchi served time for murder until last year.

82
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:38,331
And Jun? That's not possible for him.

83
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,780
After witnessing his father

84
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,100
abusing his mother, he stabbed him to death when he was eight.

85
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,107
He didn't go to jail because he was a kid, though.

86
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,756
I committed murder...

87
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:55,861
Or I am believed to do so...

88
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,167
Is that what you're saying?

89
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,770
Hold on. Where are you going with your luggage?

90
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,830
Wait, you don't have a place...

91
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,050
Let go of me.

92
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,673
This is Koyama Kanji.

93
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,700
M-Matsui-san.

94
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:38,169
Who are you? Who the heck are you?

95
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,210
No! Please!

96
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:23,673
Matsui-san...

97
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:27,900
People often mistake an unconscious person for having no heartbeat.

98
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,700
- And this is a common occurrence.
- Kirishima-san.

99
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,673
Koyama Kanji had been attracted to Megumi-san since college.

100
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,430
Why did he contact you after four years,

101
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,540
we don't know why yet,

102
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,806
but I suspect he was trying to frame you.

103
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,800
It's a lie...

104
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
It's a lie!

105
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,800
That's enough for today.

106
00:11:58,142 --> 00:12:02,340
If you had called an ambulance right away when Megumi-san collapsed...

107
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,165
Matsui-san...

108
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:09,165
Things wouldn't have gone so wrong for you.

109
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:17,373
No more, please. It's hindering his recovery.

110
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,200
I'll be back.

111
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Wait a minute.

112
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:38,900
That man is missing from the pictures.

113
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,300
Do you mean the man named Kirishima?

114
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,798
Yes.

115
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:57,773
Of course, we searched the building very thoroughly.

116
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:01,607
However, about Kirishima you say...

117
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,760
We couldn't find even a trace of blood,

118
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,530
let alone a possible body.

119
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,700
What?

120
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,454
It means Kirishima doesn't exist.

121
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:19,058
No, that can't be. That's a lie.

122
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:21,040
And neither does Jun.

123
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,831
Oh, that's right. Even Kanji saw and talked to him...

124
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:27,798
Matsui-san.

125
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,406
The person called Kirishima that you claim exists...

126
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:35,700
Everyone who had contact with him,

127
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,200
they are no longer in this world.

128
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,800
Except for you.

129
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:02,973
Matsui-san.

130
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:06,773
Matsui-san.

131
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:21,773
If we assume Matsui Yuu's claims are true...

132
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:26,006
What kind of person is this Kirishima?

133
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:32,573
Even if it's just a possibility, tell me what you think, Doc.

134
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,800
I can't be sure,

135
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,300
but if I had to give an example, it's like a group hallucination, right?

136
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,565
A group of people with some common conditions

137
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:46,265
could see the same single vision.

138
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:49,173
There are not a lot of examples of it, but it's not unheard of.

139
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:52,407
Young people who go to a psychic experience...

140
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:55,632
They all see the same ghost.

141
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:59,031
It's a simple but similar phenomenon.

142
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,300
Can that actually happen?

143
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:08,340
It could be an angel born from guilt,

144
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:14,006
or a demon nurtured by the darkness within.

145
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:16,489
We don't know which.

146
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:18,822
It's just a possibility.

147
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:24,484
Anyway, somehow, I feel sorry for him.

148
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Matsui?

149
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,700
He brought this on himself.

150
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,000
However, thanks to him, it ended without any further victims.

151
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,200
What's wrong?

152
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,732
Nothing.

153
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,500
Yuu-san.

154
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,032
Are you happy now?

155
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:45,533
- Good night.
- Good night.

156
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:55,865
Can we come in, Matsui-san?

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,830
♫ The overwhelming anger ♫

180
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,380
♫ set to the hell ♫

181
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,740
♫ that I pretended not to notice and put the lid on ♫

182
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,630
♫ I find myself fading in the bright red ♫

183
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,610
♫ I'm faking it to myself ♫
