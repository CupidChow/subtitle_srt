[Calling Jun]

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,080
Sorry, Megu.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,780
I'm afraid I should go back home.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,250
You're hiding something.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,040
Don't do it. Please.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,970
Living in that shitty share house, all of you are destroying each other...

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,930
What do you want from it?

[Hell Is Other People]
[Episode 5]

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,620
Damn it!

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:51,990
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
❌ The next victim team 💢 @viki.com

11
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:07,656
Who the hell is this guy?

12
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:14,557
You don't have to know.

13
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:20,376
Until public attention dies down, we shouldn't kill outside "Ark."

14
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:23,876
Didn't you say that, Kirishima-san?

15
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:29,190
I could enjoy it in many ways, but...

16
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,815
This is getting to be a lot of work.

17
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:34,215
Maru-san.

18
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:38,257
I don't think this is the right job for you.

19
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:42,623
Because you don't enjoy it at all.

20
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:48,625
Don't say that...

21
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:52,148
"Maru-san is my greatest masterpiece."

22
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:55,123
That was what I thought,

23
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,557
but I must've been mistaken.

24
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:04,950
I apologize for what happened today.

25
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,590
My bad habit kicked in again.

26
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:13,623
Could you please wrap things up for today?

27
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,919
Okay.

28
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:47,490
I understand.

29
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,848
That's enough. I won't ask anymore.

30
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:55,928
So today...

31
00:02:57,508 --> 00:03:01,408
I'll stay with you.

32
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:08,208
Megu...

33
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:11,600
So, Yuu-kun,

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,032
- are you happy now?
- Are you happy now?

35
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,541
Yuu-kun...

36
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,908
What's wrong with you?

37
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:58,593
Wasn't it supposed to end once I got out of there?

38
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:05,774
Yes...

39
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:13,208
In a way, if you hadn't rejected me from the start...

40
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:21,674
How can you make up for my life now?

41
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,707
Knock off the family thing.

42
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:52,441
Don't shout at me all of a sudden.

43
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:55,433
I have a lot of things to deal with.

44
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,717
What things?

45
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,620
Well, everyday life or something like that.

46
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,907
You haven't heard from them anyway.

47
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:03,840
Living together is quite important, isn't it?

48
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,510
Kirishima-san, one second, please.

49
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,930
You're not thinking about anything. You're selfish!

50
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,874
Where are you? Come out.

51
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:14,108
Give me Megu back!

52
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:20,841
Megu.

53
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:26,008
Megu!

54
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,374
Oh, Young Man.

55
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:32,141
Why are you screaming like crazy? What's going on?

56
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:37,841
Ma'am.

57
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:41,540
You...

58
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:04,736
Welcome back.

59
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,379
How do you feel now?

60
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:39,412
This is the moment when doubt turns to belief, and belief to fact.

61
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:48,440
What are you going to do with Megumi-san.

62
00:07:50,474 --> 00:07:55,301
Yuu-san, it's time to wrap things up now...

63
00:07:57,307 --> 00:08:00,507
So let's talk about it frankly.

64
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,741
Kill me...

65
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:08,731
And spare Megu.

66
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:11,341
Please...

67
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:14,074
You're still saying that.

68
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,708
I think it'll take a while.

69
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:28,641
Just get things ready so we can leave as soon as possible.

70
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,741
We need to get moving, but you're too relaxed.

71
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:35,040
Maru-chan.

72
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,272
Have you seen him make a mistake?

73
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:42,974
Just get rid of that trash all at once now.

74
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,274
Next news.

75
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:50,870
On February 22,

76
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,540
a murder occurred at a holiday home in Yamanashi Prefecture...

77
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,608
In that case, the owner of Pension 3,

78
00:08:57,608 --> 00:09:02,341
Maruyama Saburo-san and four men staying there were killed.

79
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,674
Also, a woman was seriously injured.

80
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:10,167
And today, the police released a photo of an employee

81
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:13,774
believed to be involved in the incident.

82
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:16,307
This man is Maruyama-san's nephew

83
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:22,874
and there are reports that he was subjected to workplace harassment by Maruyama-san.

84
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:24,441
The police are also trying to locate

85
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:27,462
a woman in her 50s who stayed at the holiday home around the same time.

86
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:31,328
She's suspected of being involved in the incident.

87
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,074
Young Man.

88
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:38,874
There's no point in trying so hard.

89
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,708
Didn't you like my shared house that much?

90
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:52,608
I was deeply shocked because you wanted to move out immediately!

91
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,774
But don't tell him.

92
00:09:57,774 --> 00:10:01,007
I'll give you a little after-sales service.

93
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:05,541
I said there was no point in struggling.

94
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,674
What's that?

95
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,460
You must be Maru-san.

96
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,909
Yes, the clean-up has been done.

97
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,337
We can leave at any time.

98
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:59,138
You always work so fast. That's pretty amazing.

99
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:29,474
In the end, you're merely human like everyone else.

100
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,807
How do you feel?

101
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:35,507
How does it feel to be betrayed?

102
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:51,041
Megu...

103
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,540
We must destroy this rotten world completely,

104
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,270
a great revolutions is necessary to create a new order.

105
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,441
Wait a second.

106
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,282
I was just doing what I was told.

107
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,083
What I did to you was to follow the order.

108
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:27,374
It hurts, it really hurts!

109
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,316
I don't want to die yet.

110
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:41,807
At least 100 people should be dead by me before I kill myself.

111
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:57,198
What kind of a man is Kirishima?

112
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:59,540
I'll let you live if you tell me.

113
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,531
He's a liberator.

114
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:46,214
What're you doing? You better run away fast.

115
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,773
What're you doing?

116
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,908
Why are you...

117
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:59,707
Let's just calm down for a second.

118
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:08,533
I did it not because I wanted to do but because I was scared of him.

119
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,466
Okay, let's team up, you and me.

120
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:35,074
Gosh, I'll kill you.

121
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:46,940
It's a lie, right?

122
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:54,193
Maru-san.

123
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:59,600
As I said, you're not cut out for this job after all.

124
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:02,364
You have to kill me for sure.

125
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:58,504
Yuu-san.

126
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:01,774
It's so cool.

127
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,236
Contrary to my expectations,

128
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:10,843
this kind of development isn't so bad.

129
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,900
Where is Megu?

130
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,007
What a touching reunion...

131
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:04,260
Hey...

132
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:39,908
Kirishima...

133
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:44,494
Me? I didn't kill her.

134
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:50,492
Then who did this to her?

135
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:56,074
Hold on.

136
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:58,374
Where are you going with your luggage?

137
00:18:58,374 --> 00:19:02,174
- Wait, you don't have a place...
- Let go of me.

138
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:07,374
Megu, I'm sorry.

139
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:10,704
Megu.

140
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:13,687
Megu!

141
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,016
Megu?

142
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:21,039
Hey, Megu.

143
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,884
Megu.

144
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,807
You killed Megumi-san

145
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:48,292
and tried to go on with your life as if nothing had happened, right?

146
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:55,058
Did you protect yourself by imagining that she was alive by any chance?

147
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:56,869
In your head,

148
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:01,697
were you playing a good boyfriend who endures without bothering your love?

149
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:08,011
Tell me the truth.

150
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:10,980
It's nothing.

151
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:14,986
You just do your work hard, Megu.

152
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:16,786
What happened?

153
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,474
Sorry, Megu.

154
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,916
I'm afraid I should go back home.

155
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,609
So today,

156
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:29,322
I'll stay with you.

157
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:31,458
Megu...

158
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,094
Guilty.

159
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:00,822
Well...

160
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:06,641
These are about to be settled, too.

161
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:11,781
But, Yuu-san...

162
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:15,139
We need a plot to a story...

163
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:23,071
Stop peeking at them like you're some hot shot.

164
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:26,080
[To be continued in Episode 6]
