1
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,881
Thank you for calling VMX. This is Rick.
How may I assist you today?

2
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:51,240
It’s A as in apple,
J as in Jupiter…

3
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:54,248
TL, supp call! He’s been
waiting for a while.

4
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,340
Mary Beth, you’re three minutes
over break.

5
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:00,876
Oh, I’m really sorry Roshonda,

6
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,459
that is not the experience
I want you to have.

7
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:06,967
But don’t worry ma’am,
I already raised a ticket,

8
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,291
and our escalations team
will call you back

9
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:11,170
within the next two hours.

10
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,140
Thank you for your patience, ma’am.

11
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:20,867
Is there anything else
I can assist you with?

12
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:23,927
Great.

13
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,381
What took you so long?

14
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:51,799
I've been waiting!

15
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:53,228
I’m going over my lunch hour.

16
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,915
Sorry, an old lady called.
She talked too much.

17
00:01:58,913 --> 00:01:59,913
Damn it.

18
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:04,314
Those damn old people should really have
their own dedicated hotline.

19
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,001
- They lower our productivity.
- Shhh.

20
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:09,790
You also talk too much.

21
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:16,876
You really know my weakness.

22
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,519
Oh shit!

23
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,899
Shit!

24
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:14,337
- You like it?
- Yeah!

25
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:19,907
- I'm close!
- Yeah!

26
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
By the way,

27
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:38,955
we’re being moved
to the day shift.

28
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:41,712
What?

29
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:43,614
Since when did you know?

30
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,329
Last two weeks ago.

31
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:48,105
And you didn’t even
bother to tell me?

32
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:52,003
I tried to negotiate,
but it didn’t work.

33
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:54,213
Are you an idiot?

34
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,825
Why did you agree to it?

35
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,255
- Damn it.
- How will we see each other now?

36
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,122
Do you really think I had a choice?

37
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:04,106
We’re just slaves here.

38
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:09,872
And it’s only for three months.

39
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:12,880
After that, we’re back
to the changing shifts.

40
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:28,288
Psst.

41
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:34,359
- Are you on break?
- Lunch. What’s the news?

42
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,939
Good news, or bad news?
Which do you prefer?

43
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:39,341
You’re being so dramatic.

44
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,326
Okay, good news.

45
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:45,179
You got a commendation
from a Mr. George Whittaker.

46
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:47,658
“Brenda is so good,

47
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:51,103
she’s very eloquent, speaks well.

48
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,898
I hope everybody
in your team is like her.

49
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:56,203
She deserves a raise.” Etcetera...

50
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,234
So, do I get a raise?

51
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:04,031
No. But I have merch here,
you can choose.

52
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:06,327
But I have all of those already.

53
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,162
I know you’ve gotten
a lot of commendations.

54
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:09,976
Go ahead, pick one.

55
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:15,185
Okay. Enjoy your merch and--

56
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,125
Okay, so what’s the bad news?

57
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:24,147
You were not chosen as the SME.

58
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,353
Who did TL Mike pick then?

59
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,078
Krista.

60
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:32,601
But don’t worry.

61
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,008
There’s still an opening
but in a different team.

62
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,033
Are you okay with that?

63
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:38,310
Of course, OM.

64
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:42,739
Look, I can’t guarantee you’ll get
chosen this time because...

65
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:44,562
you still need to apply,

66
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:46,476
and the TL still
makes the decision.

67
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:47,894
I just approve it.

68
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:49,984
But you can do it.

69
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,460
I have faith in you.

70
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,640
- Who’s the TL?
- TL Carl.

71
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:56,127
I don’t know him.

72
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:59,405
Well, start getting
to know the guy.

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,585
You know, stand out.

74
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:03,633
Okay?

75
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:06,156
Hey, you can do this.

76
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,312
Now, back to work.

77
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:18,586
Sure, ma’am.

78
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,697
Let me go ahead and send you
a copy of your agreement.

79
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:25,442
Can I send it via
the email address on file?

80
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:31,481
Hey, girl. That’s TL Carl.
Don’t you know him?

81
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,705
Are you still in a bad mood?

82
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:58,312
Yeah.

83
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,430
But is there anything I can do?

84
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:08,606
You said so yourself,
you’ve got no choice.

85
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:09,765
Look at me...

86
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:12,995
I’m always the top agent,

87
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:17,550
I always get high ratings,

88
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,294
but for nothing.

89
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:21,394
I’m still an agent.

90
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,658
By the way, how was your application?

91
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:30,308
I didn’t get chosen.

92
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,916
So, who did?

93
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,607
That damn Krista.

94
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:43,467
Were you really surprised Krista
got the SME role?

95
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,304
There’s a rumor on the floor
saying that...

96
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:51,684
she’s been having sex with TL Mike
in the restroom for the disabled.

97
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:54,937
I thought TL Mike was gay.

98
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,426
He’s bi.

99
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:57,851
Bi?

100
00:07:58,475 --> 00:07:59,722
Bicycle.

101
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,388
It’s bisexual, idiot!

102
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:07,448
You’re so grumpy. I was just
trying to make you laugh.

103
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:13,370
OM also asked me if I still wanted
to apply for the SME role again.

104
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:18,602
To TL Carl though,
I don’t know him.

105
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:20,537
I still need to think about it.

106
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:23,899
Ah, the good boy.
The family-oriented guy.

107
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:31,128
They say he likes initiating
tree planting and,

108
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,370
outreach programs for
the indigenous tribes.

109
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,535
What? Who has
that much free time?

110
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,355
My teammate joined one of them.

111
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:45,337
They said it was fun. And...

112
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:49,988
it eases the mind to forget
all your worries.

113
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,956
Why didn’t you join then?

114
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:57,344
I’m not into that shit.

115
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,550
But I think you’d fit in with his team.

116
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,654
Because you’re a good person.

117
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,503
Hmph, idiot!

118
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,337
What are your strengths, Brenda?

119
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:36,444
My strength is that
I’m highly competitive.

120
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:40,759
Whatever goal you set for me,
I know that I can achieve that.

121
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:54,188
Hmm...

122
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,242
Family guy.

123
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:11,775
How long have you been
with the company?

124
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,845
It’s my sixth year this year, TL.

125
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,433
I see.

126
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:20,071
How do you like to spend
your free time?

127
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:25,689
I often just stay at home alone,
watching TV.

128
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:27,931
Hmm.

129
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,770
Don’t you have a boyfriend?

130
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:38,416
Of course, I research my potential SMEs.

131
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,542
You told me you often
stayed alone at home.

132
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:45,634
So, you don’t spend much time
with your boyfriend?

133
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,736
Well, TL, he’s going
to change shifts soon,

134
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:54,751
so, we won’t be seeing each other
that often anymore.

135
00:10:58,103 --> 00:11:00,876
Okay that’s all
I need to know for now.

136
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:04,655
Any questions?

137
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:20,516
TL, when will the results of
this application come out?

138
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,216
Oh, quite likely in a few weeks time.
We’ve got a lot of applicants.

139
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,402
I don’t know why.

140
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:33,721
Maybe they find me

141
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,236
irresistible.

142
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:39,586
Yeah.

143
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:40,762
Yeah.

144
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,948
Just kidding.

145
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,745
Thank you, Brenda.

146
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:49,752
We’ll be in touch.

147
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,647
- Hi, TL!
- Hi, Andrea.

148
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,395
Have a seat.

149
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:24,779
How are you?

150
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:27,266
Are you okay?

151
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,848
I’m okay.

152
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,302
I’m sure you’ll get
promoted this time.

153
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:39,474
Don’t set my expectations high.

154
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:10,212
I'm close.

155
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,992
I’ll miss this.

156
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:45,797
Miss? Why?

157
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:48,688
Aren’t you changing shifts?

158
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:50,071
Shhh...

159
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,915
Don’t worry.

160
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:57,922
One day, I’ll just grab you
in the middle of your shift.

161
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,164
Idiot.

162
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,101
Yes.

163
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,449
Oh, why are you still up?

164
00:18:02,637 --> 00:18:04,945
I'm so pissed!

165
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,729
- Do you know Andrea?
- Yeah.

166
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,716
She’s also applying for SME
under TL Carl.

167
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:17,168
Shit! I saw them together
in Andrea’s car.

168
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,775
- Shit!
- Relax, okay?

169
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:25,767
Maybe we just need to remove
Andrea from the picture.

170
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,169
How?

171
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,472
I’ll show you.

172
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:40,712
Just think of Andrea as a moth,

173
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:47,892
and a dick is like a light for her.

174
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:54,900
There are rumors that she’ll
jump on anyone with a dick.

175
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,303
We’ll just have to wait

176
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,697
for the next time
she needs to scratch an itch,

177
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:06,384
and we will capture
every moment of it.

178
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:13,861
And then, we’ll upload her videos
on streaming platforms.

179
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:17,306
We’ll also make sure that
a lot of people will see it...

180
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:18,695
because it’s educational.

181
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,705
Hi, this is Andrea Villaluna,
ID number 606894.

182
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,205
Can I get the entry password?

183
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,454
Thank you.

184
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,143
This will be the ultimate plan.

185
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,815
This will surely work.

186
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:06,760
Are you ready to become a TL?

187
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:11,253
Yes! Yes!

188
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:24,200
Whoever did that is a real demon.

189
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:29,362
We know Andrea’s a slut,
but to announce it that way?

190
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,839
- That’s over the line.
- Why? What happened?

191
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:35,782
Check your email.

192
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:41,133
Carl, please don't ignore me.
I know you're not with your wife right now.

193
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,279
Carl? Asshole!

194
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:50,119
Hi TL, can I sit here?

195
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:52,487
Sure, no problem.

196
00:21:57,596 --> 00:22:03,698
TL, I heard you hike up
mountains for fun.

197
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:07,720
Yeah, sometimes.

198
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:11,067
We plant trees and help
indigenous groups.

199
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,760
TL, when’s the next climb?

200
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:19,622
Can I join?

201
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:22,886
Sure!

202
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:29,105
But that’s not for a while.

203
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:32,627
My wife always joins,
but she’s pregnant now.

204
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,172
You know, my wife has
an earring just like this.

205
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:48,521
Beautiful.

206
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:07,891
Hi, babe. Did you eat already?

207
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,201
Yes, babe? Why did you call?

208
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:12,429
The kids don’t want to sleep yet.

209
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:14,816
They’re asking if
we can go to a museum.

210
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,890
Okay.

211
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:20,577
- Right? You want to visit one?
- Yes!

212
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:23,073
Kiss daddy! Go ahead, kiss daddy!

213
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:24,407
Soon baby.

214
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:26,076
Go with mommy to pick me up
one of these days

215
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:28,468
and let’s all go to the
museum together, okay?

216
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:29,857
See you soon! I love you!

217
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:31,706
First of all, you know
why we’re here, right?

218
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:33,567
We’re going to celebrate so many things.

219
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:36,648
Give yourselves a round of applause
for making it here. Okay?

220
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,755
Congratulations!

221
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,570
We didn’t know we’d last this long.

222
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:45,095
Now, we’ve grown a lot,
so I want to award you guys.

223
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,160
The first award goes
to our top earner.

224
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:52,218
So that’s Angela.
Let’s give her a round of applause

225
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:53,492
Congrats!

226
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:54,764
Okay.

227
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:59,134
Next, to the person who’s always
next to Megan, you know who.

228
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:02,718
Her partner in crime, Joseph!
Joseph, congrats!

229
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:05,476
Yeah! Good job! Good job!

230
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,827
And of course our most—

231
00:24:08,852 --> 00:24:13,842
I wanted to add this award,
the most friendly agent.

232
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:16,546
This is important for our relationships
inside the office, right?

233
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,671
So first Joseph, now it’s John.
Congrats!

234
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:31,016
Okay, alright. Every year,
we’re going to invent awards.

235
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,810
It’s up to you. Impress me.

236
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:36,463
Show me what you’ve got
and everything else, okay?

237
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:42,703
I promise I will give you
what you deserve. Okay?

238
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:32,071
Yes.

239
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:36,649
Ah, yes.

240
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,119
Shit.

241
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:42,189
Shit!

242
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,407
Oh, that's it.

243
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:47,907
Yeah.

244
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:58,165
Shit.

245
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,306
Oh yes.

246
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:05,899
I'm close.

247
00:26:05,924 --> 00:26:06,924
Shit.

248
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,977
I’m sorry, TL.

249
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:28,199
I feel guilty about this.

250
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:31,745
You’re married.

251
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:38,300
Don’t be sorry,

252
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,505
as long as no one finds out
and you stay discreet,

253
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:45,584
we’re good.

254
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:49,063
You’re going to have a baby, TL.

255
00:26:51,222 --> 00:26:53,224
It’s our third kid, relax.

256
00:26:57,794 --> 00:26:59,087
When we got married,

257
00:26:59,728 --> 00:27:01,188
she wanted to have
a baby right away.

258
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:04,933
It put a lot of pressure on me.

259
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,419
Every time we had sex,
it’s all baby this, baby that.

260
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:18,283
Can’t we just enjoy it?

261
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,961
Not think of anything.

262
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:33,484
Thank you, Brenda,
for doing this with me.

263
00:27:34,572 --> 00:27:37,211
You’re helping me a lot.

264
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:42,453
Hopefully...

265
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,089
there’s a next time.

266
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,366
TL, I have a boyfriend.

267
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:52,742
I know.

268
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,961
I’m not asking you
to do anything, I mean...

269
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:01,343
we’re still going home to them.

270
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,558
Right?

271
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:10,714
I guess.

272
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:39,488
I'm close.

273
00:29:40,762 --> 00:29:44,129
Come on.

274
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:45,605
Yeah!

275
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,644
- Shit!
- I'm close!

276
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:49,669
Yeah!

277
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:51,283
Yeah.

278
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:23,215
Hey. girl, is that her?

279
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:26,043
Yeah! They were seen
together in her TL’s car.

280
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:28,071
Isn’t the TL married?

281
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,082
Yes, and his wife is pregnant.

282
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:33,996
They do say a chained chicken
is easier to capture.

283
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,949
But for what? For promotion?

284
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,207
Okay, so both of you are brave.

285
00:30:42,455 --> 00:30:44,332
Why don’t you say
that to my face?

286
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:46,405
We didn’t mention
any names though.

287
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,551
- Oh, really?
- Ouch!

288
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:50,426
- Brenda!
- Ouch! Get off of me!

289
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,600
Brenda, what’s going on
with you?

290
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:58,511
Since when have you
minded rumors?

291
00:30:59,262 --> 00:31:01,421
- Huh?
- It’s annoying, OM.

292
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,964
I was just trying to defend myself.

293
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:07,519
I know that. I get it. But--

294
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:13,955
If you’re a regular agent,
sure I’ll let you fight with anyone.

295
00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:16,421
But you’re our top agent.

296
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:20,566
Look at me, you’re also vying
for the SME role.

297
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,723
I’ll talk to those two ladies,

298
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,253
so that this won’t
have to reach HR.

299
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,800
Brenda, you have to calm down.

300
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:36,746
Yes, OM. I’m sorry.

301
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:40,805
The rumors aren’t true, right?

302
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,778
No, OM.

303
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,041
Good.

304
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:47,980
Because I don’t think
you’re capable of such things.

305
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:49,979
TL Carl too.

306
00:31:50,004 --> 00:31:52,543
I don’t believe he can
do those things.

307
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:05,953
Oh, babe! How’ve you been?

308
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:10,725
- You don’t look excited to see me.
- Why are you so early?

309
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,251
I was just surprised.

310
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:13,411
Of course.

311
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:17,762
I want you-know-what.

312
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:23,428
Let’s go.

313
00:32:58,092 --> 00:32:59,092
Hey.

314
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:25,878
Babe, are you okay?

315
00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:29,296
Sorry, I just need to
take care of something.

316
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:33,217
There’s an opening in our team,
maybe you’d like to try for it.

317
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,728
What? Why would I do that?

318
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:39,814
So we could be together.

319
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:42,634
No.

320
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:45,763
Don’t you want us
to be together?

321
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:49,382
Phil, that’s an agent role.

322
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:51,301
If I wanted a new role,

323
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:53,832
I want to move up,
not laterally.

324
00:33:54,313 --> 00:33:57,400
So, what? You’re good.

325
00:33:57,773 --> 00:33:59,408
- You’ll be promoted in no time.
- CARL: You forgot about me already.

326
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:02,868
- They promote people quickly there.
- CARL: I miss eating you out.

327
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:06,724
So? I’ll refer you?

328
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:11,955
Phil, I won’t be an agent
my entire life.

329
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:15,391
If you’re happy doing the same thing,
then I’m happy for you.

330
00:34:15,477 --> 00:34:17,312
But I’m not like that.

331
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,361
What are you saying?

332
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,416
It’s like you don’t have a goal.

333
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,056
Wow.

334
00:34:26,976 --> 00:34:31,924
Honestly, you and TL Carl were hired
at the same time.

335
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:34,146
You even started
earlier than him.

336
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,986
But look at him,

337
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:38,403
his life is improving

338
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,311
and he’s got his own family.

339
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:43,902
Shit.

340
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:48,439
If I’m not needed here,
then I’m leaving.

341
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,036
Damn you!

342
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,166
So? I thought you didn’t
want to see me anymore.

343
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:02,931
I’m a jealous guy.

344
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:05,875
Phil was getting on my nerves.

345
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:08,995
He wanted me
to apply to his team.

346
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:10,969
Why not?

347
00:35:11,616 --> 00:35:14,830
I want to grow
here, in our account.

348
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:19,829
Grow? I’m growing something now.

349
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:22,799
I want to be an SME.

350
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:25,169
You will be, don’t worry.

351
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,566
I promise.

352
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:29,757
- Really?
- Sure.

353
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:47,654
Oh yes.

354
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,679
Come on.

355
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:50,598
Shit.

356
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:58,662
- Phil? Phil!
- What the... Why?

357
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:00,997
Come on, just let him go.

358
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:02,498
Phil!

359
00:36:03,636 --> 00:36:06,100
- I can explain.
- Explain?

360
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,513
Brenda, I saw everything!

361
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,748
I’m sorry!

362
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:15,803
- I’m sorry?
- I’m sorry.

363
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:17,538
What am I, a customer?

364
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:20,984
“I’m sorry,

365
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:25,341
I do apologize for the inconvenience.”
It’s that simple, Brenda?

366
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:31,232
- I’m only doing this because--
- For what? To get a promotion?

367
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:37,373
I’m sorry. This is all that I am.

368
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:39,794
- I’m sorry.
- Phil...

369
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:42,356
Sorry, my dream only reaches this far.

370
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:47,857
An agent for life. I’m sorry.

371
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:52,586
Phil, let’s talk about this.

372
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:55,588
Don’t you ever speak to me again!

373
00:36:57,158 --> 00:36:58,286
We’re done.

374
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,888
Phil...

375
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:10,843
Phil...

376
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:40,594
Carl, why aren't you
answering my calls?

377
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:41,619
Carl, hey!

378
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:42,798
Did your wife
forbid you from texting?

379
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,476
What’s your problem?

380
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:13,852
I’ve been messaging you.

381
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:16,423
Don’t play hard to get.

382
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:18,989
Hard to get, huh?

383
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:21,405
Who are you looking for, miss?

384
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:22,972
Are you looking for me?

385
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,495
Guys, meet our new SME, Sheena!

386
00:38:53,227 --> 00:39:02,153
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

387
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:49,643
Hey! Give daddy a hug.

388
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,584
I missed you guys.

389
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,350
Let’s go?

390
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,626
Come on.

391
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:57,842
Let's go.

392
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:25,574
Babe?

393
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:29,419
I’m going to the restroom.

394
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,350
Okay.

395
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:18,185
Are you okay?

396
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:19,727
Yes, OM.

397
00:41:20,743 --> 00:41:24,864
TL Carl already submitted
his resignation after the incident.

398
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:27,755
I can’t believe his wife did that to you.

399
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:29,818
Because of jealousy?

400
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,334
I really don’t understand
why she did that.

401
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,521
I’m just trying to do my job.

402
00:41:37,104 --> 00:41:41,701
The reason I called you is
because of Carl’s vacant TL position.

403
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:45,396
Would you like to be a TL?
I’ll recommend you.
