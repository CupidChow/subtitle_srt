Do you know the meaning of the words on this plaque?

4
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,690
"Serve the People" means that

5
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,610
we must work for the greater good of the Republic over personal happiness.

6
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,364
It is the People's Army's first duty that our Premier proclaimed in 1948.

7
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:26,450
The sickle and hammer represent the proletariat revolution.

8
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,244
The barley symbolizes harvests.

9
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:34,003
The red star symbolizes the bright future once socialism is realized, Sir!

10

Very good.

11
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:46,278
The new army cook is more enlightened than high-level officers.

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,894
Consider this plaque more precious than your life, Comrade.

13
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,062

Is that all?

When Commander Pi ran out of bullets on a battlefield,

32
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:03,918
he crushed the heads of injured enemy soldiers with his bare feet.

33
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,422
He's a hero who terrorized the battlefields!

34

35
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:13,552

Understood, Sir!

37
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,056
You must take responsibility for what you say.

38
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:20,726
You must practice what you've been taught and say.

Don't worry, Sir!

40
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,313
I will do as I say, be sincere,

41
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:29,008
and be a man with ideas and expertise of the proletarian class.

42
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:33,948

Is that it?

184
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,731
Shin Mu Gwang!

185
00:27:41,315 --> 00:27:46,612
You're a fool who can't even grab straw when drowning in mud!

186
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:48,955
I'm disappointed!

187
00:28:04,755 --> 00:28:11,078
So what if her skin is pure white!

188
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:17,592
If my wife didn't farm every day, she'd be whiter than you.

189
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:24,400
<i>So what if you are beautiful!</i>

190
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:31,331
If my wife dressed up and wore makeup like you, she'd be prettier.

191
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,355
<i>So what if you smell like ash tree?</i>

192
00:28:37,355 --> 00:28:41,442
My wife smells sweet like that, too!

193
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:45,779
Just less sweet since she can't be bothered to wash every day.

194
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:48,257
See?

195
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:51,830
There's nothing special about you!

196
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:58,341
Thought you could win over a revolutionary warrior like that?

197
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:07,651
She's the most beautiful woman revered by the entire division,

198
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:10,062
but I refused her?

199
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:16,693
I didn't think you'd make things awkward for me.

200
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:20,539
What is it, Comrade Warden?

201
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:22,833
Suddenly, Madam called and said that

202
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:29,131
you're a soldier with no regard for the "serve the people" teaching!

203
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:30,674
She said to fire you at once

204
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:34,412
and replace you with a smart, quick-witted new soldier!
- What?

205
00:29:34,412 --> 00:29:38,657
What disgraceful thing have you done to her?

206
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:40,267
Cat got your tongue?

207
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:44,913
Why would a smart man like you do such a stupid thing?

208
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:50,528
Revolution isn't about serving people food.

209
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:54,532
It's not about painting pictures or embroidering.

210
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:58,953
Revolution demands blood sacrifice!

211
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:02,748
Two-thirds of our people are still struggling in pain.

212
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:05,626
The people of the southern half are suffering from cold, hunger,

213
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:08,212
poverty, and disease.

214
00:30:08,212 --> 00:30:12,633
The American imperialists could attack us any minute!

215
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,443
Listen.
<i>[As long as we have our Great Leader...]</i>

216
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:18,889
Even if the commander is away, you must serve his wife properly.

217
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:20,891
If you don't serve her well,

218
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:25,729
the commander will be worried in leading the military talks.

219
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:29,775
Then it will affect our combat readiness.

220
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:33,654
Our division's readiness will affect the corps' operational capabilities.

221
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:35,406
If the corps' capabilities are weakened,

222
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:38,367
it will affect the entire army's strategies and deployment.

223
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:42,830
Then if a World War III should break out,

224
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,916
it won't be enough to execute you 100 times!

225
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,461
I, your warden, will also be shot to death

226
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:53,382
<i>along with your captain, the battalion chief, and their families!</i>

227
00:30:55,092 --> 00:30:57,636
That is all from a top-down perspective.

228
00:30:57,636 --> 00:31:01,223
Now, I'll explain in personal detail.

229
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:05,060
You said you want to be promoted to officer.

230
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,647
That can be easily obtained with one word from the commander.

231
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:12,735
Who can make compliments about you come from the commander's mouth?

232
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:15,590
It's the commander's wife and lover,

233
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,110
his beloved, comrade Ryu Su Ryeon.

234
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:20,826
She has the power!

235
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:23,496
I promised her I'd send a new soldier in the morning.

236
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:26,749
If you don't change her mind by tomorrow morning,

237
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:29,084
your army life is over.

238
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:33,939
Your life will be over, too!

239
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:54,969
How old are you?
<i>[All people need to do is decide.]</i>

240
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:56,895
Twenty-three, Sir.
<i>[Organic compound fertilizer]</i>

241
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:02,435
How is a young man like you in charge of the production here?
<i>[5 years earlier]</i>

242
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:06,288
The chief is ill, so I've come in his place.

243
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:08,332
What about your schooling?

244
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:09,875
I graduated from middle school.

245
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:13,586
Do you have a fiancée?

246
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:14,964
Not yet, Sir.

247
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:17,515
Oh, really?

248
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:26,116
Mu Gwang! Mu Gwang!

249
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:29,478
The accounting officer of the People's Commune

250
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:33,691
called you and me to come to him now.

251
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:36,658
I borrowed this. Go and change.

252
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:52,585
You couldn't go to the army because of your ailing mother.

253
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:54,962
Listen.

254
00:32:54,962 --> 00:33:01,051
I will admit her to a hospital, and register you in the army.

255
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:04,013
Really, Sir?

256
00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:07,182
All his friends went to the army.

257
00:33:07,182 --> 00:33:10,769
I always felt bad that he was left behind all alone.

258
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:14,014
This worked out well. I'm glad.

259
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,191
Thank you, Sir!

260
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:19,970
<i>A man should go to the army.</i>

261
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,598
<i>Of course.</i>

262
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:27,720
<i>Those who don't serve face great discrimination.</i>

263
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,082
<i>Broaden your views and knowledge in the army.</i>

264
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:36,420
<i>Enter the Party and make great contributions.</i>

265
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,090
<i>Then become an officer.</i>

266
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,926
<i>Then you'll live in the city.</i>

267
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:47,598
<i>Then I shall give my beloved, dear daughter</i>

268
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:52,727
<i>to marry you, Son.</i>

269
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:54,162
Comrade Warden!

270
00:33:55,939 --> 00:33:57,474
It's a telegram.

271
00:33:59,193 --> 00:34:01,319
<i>Go home at once.</i>

272
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:08,702
Mother!

273
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:17,744
If you want to be a good son, hurry and bring me a daughter-in-law.

274
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:25,202
I want her to prepare my ancestral rites when I die.

275
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:29,415
Did you distinguish yourself in the army?

276
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:31,875
Not yet, Sir.

277
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:34,712
You didn't enter the Party, either.

278
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:36,213
No, Sir.

279
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:41,167
Is there any possibility of becoming an officer?

280
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:44,863
I'm not sure yet, Sir.

281
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:49,340
It is given that water flows down,

282
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,879
and a man should climb up.

283
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,331
Father!

284
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:56,375
Allow me to call you so, Sir!

285
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,878
I'll receive distinction this year and enter the Party within three years!

286
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:03,257
Even if I must die in the army,

287
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:07,528
I won't return home unless I achieve all this!

288
00:35:07,528 --> 00:35:09,513
Can you really promise that?

289
00:35:09,513 --> 00:35:11,814
I'll write it in blood, Sir!

290
00:35:14,226 --> 00:35:16,745
There's no need to go that far.

291
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:36,790
Ready for the picture?

292
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,825
One, two!

293
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:47,801
<i>My father and I are waiting to hear of your promotion.</i>

294
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:52,955
<i>We hope to hear from you soon.</i>

295
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,120
<i>[Notice Board]</i>

296
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:05,720
<i>[Let's sweat more for the future of our great country]</i>

297
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,920
<i>[List of Promoted in 1974]</i>

298
00:36:26,924 --> 00:36:28,926
I got it!

299
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:34,640
I got promoted!

300
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,840
<i>[I want to die. Why didn't I get it? Why, why, why?]</i>

301
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:12,661
<i>Is the cook being transferred?</i>

302
00:37:13,637 --> 00:37:17,897
<i>Damn fools will fight to enter the commander's house.</i>

303
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,729
The warden will have fun choosing.

304
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:26,525
Why take that nasty job to be promoted a bit faster?

305
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:28,360
Why not!

306
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,279
That stupid jerk!

307
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:33,990
Ma'am!

308
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,288
It's a precious drink from my hometown.

309
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:41,039
How nice!

310
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,374
I'll hold it for you, Sir.

311
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:44,509
Get lost, Bastard!

312
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:48,338
Move! Move! Move!

313
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:49,998
Get lost!

314
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:55,637
I'll do it, Sir.

315
00:37:55,637 --> 00:37:57,630
Scram!

316
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:04,946
Go away!

317
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:15,115
<i>Bark louder!</i>

318
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:17,910
<i>Louder!</i>

319
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:21,580
Bark louder!

320
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:24,749
Go faster!

321
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,334
Go!

322
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:27,628
Are you a horse or a dog?

323
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:29,963
- Run faster!
- Stop crawling!

324
00:38:29,963 --> 00:38:31,381
Go away!

325
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:33,799
Mommy!

326
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,260
Hello, Sir.

327
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,888
I love serving others.

328
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:40,681
I'm doing my duty to serve the people.

329
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:44,569
Do you think serving others is a duty for the people?

330
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:47,522
Without a heart to serve others,

331
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:49,650
how can I serve the Republic?

332
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,652
We must serve others like our parents.

333
00:38:51,652 --> 00:38:53,636
Is that so?

334
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:56,990
What do you think is the meaning of life?

335
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,327
To give all your blood and passion to those needing service, Sir!

336
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:05,698
A soldier must shine by working hard every day for the people!

337
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:21,223
<i>I harvested the barley a few days ago.</i>

338
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:24,351
<i>I finished planting crops for fall too.</i>

339
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:26,770
<i>Since there's no one to watch our son,</i>

340
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,481
<i>I tied him to a tree in the shade.</i>

341
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:32,567
<i>I caught some grasshoppers for him to play with.</i>

342
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:38,064
<i>He swallowed one by accident and almost choked to death.</i>

343
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:57,634
Good morning, Noonim.

344
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:00,345
Didn't the warden mention anything?

345
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:02,097
Yes, he did.

346
00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:04,307
If I lack anything on my job again,

347
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:07,844
I'll leave before you demand a new cook.

348
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,647
No need to make lotus flower soup for breakfast.

349
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:14,767
Use two eggs to make soup, then return to your squadron.

350
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:39,092
Noonim!

351
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:43,488
I've brought your egg soup.

352
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:45,599
<i>Leave it there and go.</i>

353
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,901
<i>Tell them to send a new soldier soon.</i>

354
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:53,856
Noonim.

355
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:57,944
Even if I cannot stay here any longer,

356
00:40:57,944 --> 00:41:01,198
please eat this soup before it gets cold.

357
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:04,008
Allow me to serve you.

358
00:41:14,002 --> 00:41:16,630
Please eat this.

359
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,174
This is a self-reflection I wrote for you.

360
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:21,943
If it doesn't please you, I will rewrite it.

361
00:41:22,677 --> 00:41:25,113
Do you know what you did wrong?

362
00:41:25,113 --> 00:41:27,682
Yes, I do. Please give me another chance.

363
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:30,393
There is no chance of improvement.

364
00:41:30,393 --> 00:41:33,063
Return to your squadron.

365
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:36,441
I already told the warden.

366
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:39,840
You'll be discharged by the end of the year.

367
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,740
Go home and be with your wife.

368
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,204
Please give me another chance!

369
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:51,873
If I can't serve properly for the people,

370
00:41:51,873 --> 00:41:54,960
let me be hit by a car or get shot to death!

371
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,946
A bullet shall strike through my head!

372
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:03,760
How will you serve the people?

373
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,388
I'll do anything you say, Noonim.

374
00:42:06,388 --> 00:42:10,816
Then strip naked and run around the training court three times.

375
00:42:13,061 --> 00:42:15,647
You must serve the people.

376
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:17,573
Strip now!

377
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,320
<i> Serve the People</i>

378
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:33,456
You must serve the people.

379
00:42:33,456 --> 00:42:35,241
Strip!

380
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:45,911
Take it all off!

381
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:49,155
Do you not wish to serve the people?

382
00:43:06,823 --> 00:43:11,694
I see you do want to serve the people.

383
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:16,282
Good job.

384
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:19,276
Well done.

385
00:43:48,823 --> 00:43:49,991
Slowly!

386
00:44:16,726 --> 00:44:21,405
<i>Are you not a great soldier at your base?</i>

387
00:44:22,274 --> 00:44:23,817
<i>I am.</i>

388
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:27,979
<i>The captain, the warden, and everyone thinks so of me.</i>

389
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,365
<i>Then why?</i>

390
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:36,270
<i>Why are you groping my body like a shameless fool?</i>

391
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:42,335
<i>But it's our first night...</i>

392
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:45,413
<i>I am disappointed in you.</i>

393
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:14,534
<i>You're my wife.</i>

394
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:18,370
<i>If you won't let me do it, I'll have to do it by force.</i>

395
00:45:18,371 --> 00:45:20,773
<i>I don't mind you doing it.</i>

396
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:24,711
<i>First, kneel before me and promise</i>

397
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:28,548
<i>to listen to your superiors and work hard through the woes</i>

398
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:32,135
<i>and get promoted to make me happy.</i>

399
00:45:32,135 --> 00:45:34,220
<i>I already wrote that in the pledge.</i>

400
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,513
<i>No.</i>

401
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:38,391
<i>That pledge was to my father.</i>

402
00:45:38,391 --> 00:45:41,135
<i>Write it in blood for me now.</i>

403
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:43,521
<i>In blood?</i>

404
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:44,897
<i>Yes.</i>

405
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:47,692
<i>You must pledge to me in blood.</i>

406
00:45:47,692 --> 00:45:50,903
<i>But he said it wasn't necessary.</i>

407
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:53,073
<i>It is to me.</i>

408
00:45:53,073 --> 00:45:57,151
<i>I'm the one giving you my body, not my father.</i>

409
00:46:01,706 --> 00:46:03,391
<i>Right.</i>

410
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:24,787
<i>That'll do for tonight.</i>

411
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,973
<i>I trust you.</i>

412
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:41,371
<i>When you return to the base, you must work hard.</i>

413
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:43,523
<i>I promise I will.</i>

414
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:48,128
<i>You'll make achievements, right?</i>

415
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:50,037
<i>I will!</i>

416
00:46:51,423 --> 00:46:53,174
<i>And listen to your superiors?</i>

417
00:46:53,174 --> 00:46:55,142
<i>I said I will!</i>

418
00:46:58,513 --> 00:47:03,309
<i>Maybe you should finish writing the pledge in blood.</i>

419
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:05,094
<i>Damn it!</i>

420
00:47:51,274 --> 00:47:52,317
Hello?

421
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:55,403
<i>Madam! It's the warden.</i>

422
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:56,738
<i>Shall I send a new soldier?</i>

423
00:47:56,738 --> 00:47:58,740
After you scolded him,

424
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,869
the cook has become more thorough. I'm satisfied.

425
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:04,621
<i>Thank you, Madam!</i>

426
00:48:04,621 --> 00:48:09,292
<i>If his work ethic has improved, that means we've all improved.</i>

427
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:12,070
<i>Please scold him yourself if need be</i>

428
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:15,031
<i>or scold me or his captain.</i>

429
00:48:15,031 --> 00:48:16,690
I will.

430
00:48:26,518 --> 00:48:28,819
You may leave for today.

431
00:48:30,746 --> 00:48:32,315
Already?

432
00:48:32,315 --> 00:48:34,583
I want to be alone.

433
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:38,012
I haven't found one yet.

434
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:40,189
I'll find it.

435
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:45,694
As the commander is away, you don't have to come at dawn.

436
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:57,106
Must I dress you?

437
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:33,534
Are you getting off work already?

438
00:49:34,794 --> 00:49:36,479
No, Sir!

439
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:38,656
I'm headed to the market.

440
00:49:40,466 --> 00:49:44,470
Don't try to buy everything like the capitalists.

441
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,773
Try digging wild greens yourself for the food.

442
00:49:51,277 --> 00:49:52,845
Captain!

443
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:08,118
Get up! Go on!

444
00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:12,874
Take your squad out now!

445
00:50:12,874 --> 00:50:14,633
Go!

446
00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:23,025
Shin Mu Gwang!

447
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:26,803
Are you smoking now?

448
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:28,097
Tired?

449
00:50:28,097 --> 00:50:29,098
No, Sir.

450
00:50:29,098 --> 00:50:31,184
You avoided punishment alone.

451
00:50:31,184 --> 00:50:33,844
When we went to work reformation, were you tired?

452
00:50:34,437 --> 00:50:37,471
- No, Sir.
- You look tired.

453
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:48,234
You even have nice cigarettes.

454
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:52,622
What's so hard?

455
00:50:52,622 --> 00:50:57,092
With the commander gone, you're free to mess around with her.

456
00:50:57,092 --> 00:51:00,012
It's perfect, isn't it?

457
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:04,859
Damn it!

458
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:07,445
I was joking, you bastard!

459
00:51:07,445 --> 00:51:11,140
If you say that again, I'll rip out your tongue, shove it up your ass,

460
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,892
then pull it out of your mouth!

461
00:51:12,892 --> 00:51:14,434
Shit!

462
00:51:14,435 --> 00:51:16,354
Damn it!

463
00:51:22,068 --> 00:51:24,194
Hey! Stop!

464
00:51:24,195 --> 00:51:27,314
I said, don't hit the face.

465
00:51:29,283 --> 00:51:30,451
Fool.

466
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:33,387
Do you think you'll work under her forever?

467
00:51:33,387 --> 00:51:35,957
If you squeal on this too,

468
00:51:35,957 --> 00:51:39,068
you'll be parting with your head forever.

469
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:40,853
Got it?

470
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:12,192
Shit!

471
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:21,802
I report, Madam!

472
00:52:22,795 --> 00:52:25,590
I will not come upstairs as of today, Madam.

473
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:29,117
<i>Come in and say it. I can't hear you.</i>

474
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,405
Madam?

475
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,650
Noonim.

476
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,794
What do you want to say?

477
00:52:48,112 --> 00:52:50,448
I won't come upstairs as of today.

478
00:52:50,448 --> 00:52:52,407
You already did.

479
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:55,876
- The soldiers keep...
- They keep what?

480
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:04,487
I won't come up even if I die.

481
00:53:04,487 --> 00:53:06,888
Even if you die?

482
00:53:17,225 --> 00:53:19,477
Are you afraid of the soldiers or me?

483
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:23,984
Mu Gwang... I'm so dizzy.

484
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:28,356
Hurry and get dressed.

485
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:30,274
I'll call the squadron doctor.

486
00:55:30,274 --> 00:55:31,817
There's no need.

487
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:33,860
Don't stop your hands.

488
00:55:33,861 --> 00:55:35,571
Don't stop your lips either.

489
00:56:22,076 --> 00:56:24,996
It doesn't matter where on my body.

490
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:29,809
Suck or touch me all you want.

491
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:32,586
I'm not the commander's wife now.

492
00:56:32,586 --> 00:56:35,138
I'm your wife, Mu Gwang.

493
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:28,309
I'm yours.

494
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:30,261
I'm already yours.

495
00:57:31,395 --> 00:57:34,422
Kill me or save me at your will.

496
00:58:36,085 --> 00:58:37,602
Noonim!

497
00:58:38,254 --> 00:58:40,597
What? Noonim!

498
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:42,566
Please!

499
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,713
Noonim! No!

500
00:58:57,398 --> 00:58:58,882
Noonim!

501
00:59:05,114 --> 00:59:08,659
<i>You'll be discharged by the end of the year.</i>

502
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:11,145
<i>Go home and be with your wife.</i>

503
00:59:11,145 --> 00:59:13,663
<i>I told you not to come upstairs!</i>

504
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:18,252
<i>He's a hero who terrorized the battlefields!</i>

505
00:59:18,252 --> 00:59:20,671
<i>Enter the Party and make great contributions.</i>

506
00:59:20,671 --> 00:59:23,257
<i>Then become an officer.</i>

507
00:59:23,257 --> 00:59:28,512
<i>If you want to please me, bring me a daughter-in-law.</i>

508
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:31,407
<i>You must pledge to me in blood.</i>

509
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:34,020
<i>Do you think you'll work under her forever?</i>

510
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,020
<i>Those who don't serve, face great discrimination.</i>

511
00:59:37,021 --> 00:59:39,773
<i>If you don't change her mind by tomorrow morning,</i>

512
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:43,569
<i>you army life is over. Your life will be over too!</i>

513
00:59:44,853 --> 00:59:46,572
Jeez!

514
00:59:46,572 --> 00:59:48,110
You scared me!

515
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,450
If you lose your mind, I'll be punished.

516
01:00:00,336 --> 01:00:02,421
That will do.

517
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:07,083
It made my life worth living until now.

518
01:00:09,845 --> 01:00:15,600
Now I, Ryu Su Ryeon, will have no regrets even if I die now.

519
01:00:28,614 --> 01:00:30,815
You may leave.

520
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:34,886
I just got here.

521
01:00:53,973 --> 01:00:55,490
Shit!

522
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:01,939
I tried to wake you up.

523
01:01:01,939 --> 01:01:04,849
I even kicked, but you wouldn't wake up.

524
01:01:05,943 --> 01:01:08,395
You must've worked really hard.

525
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:15,385
Excuse me.

526
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:17,754
Sorry!

527
01:01:18,955 --> 01:01:20,481
So sorry!

528
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:37,407
Oh, no! I'm so sorry for sleeping in!

529
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,661
Come and sit here.

530
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:42,313
I'll make breakfast quickly.

531
01:01:42,313 --> 01:01:44,422
Just sit.

532
01:01:56,535 --> 01:01:59,413
It's my turn to serve for the people.

533
01:01:59,413 --> 01:02:01,381
I made it.

534
01:03:37,302 --> 01:03:40,097
Want to pick wild greens before the rainy season comes?

535
01:03:40,097 --> 01:03:43,590
- I can't leave the residence.
- Why not?

536
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:47,104
What do you mean? The commander won't allow it.

537
01:03:47,104 --> 01:03:50,365
That's why you have no shoes.

538
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:53,284
I have a pair of army boots.

539
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:58,690
They were supplied by the Premier, so he couldn't throw them out.

540
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:02,244
Maybe he fears someone will steal you.

541
01:04:02,244 --> 01:04:05,664
Who would dare steal the commander's wife?

542
01:04:05,664 --> 01:04:08,876
It's because he's embarrassed to divorce a second time.

543
01:04:08,876 --> 01:04:10,393
What?

544
01:04:19,178 --> 01:04:21,221
Would you like to sneak out?

545
01:04:22,389 --> 01:04:24,215
How?

546
01:04:35,402 --> 01:04:37,378
Where are you going, Sir?

547
01:04:39,198 --> 01:04:42,040
To the market. What's this?

548
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:47,956
She told me to buy some corn, but now wants them exchanged for yams.

549
01:04:47,956 --> 01:04:50,575
She makes me work like a dog!

550
01:04:57,341 --> 01:04:59,092
May I have one, Sir?

551
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:02,411
- No one will know it's missing.
- No way!

552
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:04,431
Where is your conscience?

553
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:07,100
What if they think Madam left one out?

554
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,645
How will they know just one is missing?

555
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:12,697
Even if they do, they'll just curse her in secret.

556
01:05:17,903 --> 01:05:22,891
Because the commander is away, you'll disgrace his wife's dignity?

557
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:26,787
If she loses her dignity, the commander will lose his too.

558
01:05:26,787 --> 01:05:30,666
If so, the commanding general will lose his dignity.

559
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:37,455
If so, the Minister of Defense and the Premier will lose their dignity!

560
01:05:37,455 --> 01:05:41,802
If that happens, and World War III erupts,

561
01:05:41,802 --> 01:05:47,015
then it won't be enough to execute you 1000 times!

562
01:05:47,015 --> 01:05:48,934
Your family will also be shot to death

563
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:53,237
with your captain, battalion chief, the commander, and general!

564
01:05:56,275 --> 01:05:58,260
Hurry and go, Sir.

565
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,161
Work hard.

566
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:08,294
Wow, if I eat two corns, fuck, the world will blow up!

567
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,420
<i>[For the people,]</i>

568
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:27,930
<i>[we kissed.]</i>

569
01:09:30,363 --> 01:09:33,341
Look! It's a rainbow!

570
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:35,276
Do you want me to take you there?

571
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:11,471
Give it to me.

572
01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:13,698
Why just me?

573
01:10:13,698 --> 01:10:15,792
Let's do it together!

574
01:10:19,162 --> 01:10:21,105
- Hey!
- Wait!

575
01:10:36,721 --> 01:10:38,089
Stop.

576
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:02,672
<i>All clear on duty, Sir!</i>

577
01:11:06,835 --> 01:11:08,036
Oh, no!

578
01:11:31,276 --> 01:11:32,652
What are you doing, Bastard!

579
01:11:32,652 --> 01:11:34,696
I was doing the laundry, commander!

580
01:11:34,696 --> 01:11:37,832
Do you think you can fool the commander?

581
01:12:25,205 --> 01:12:27,365
Son of a bitch.

582
01:13:30,437 --> 01:13:32,372
What's the matter?

583
01:13:32,372 --> 01:13:35,926
The commander was shooting me in my dream.

584
01:13:35,926 --> 01:13:40,037
If you hadn't woken me, I would've died.

585
01:13:42,615 --> 01:13:44,425
I'm sorry.

586
01:13:48,955 --> 01:13:52,625
For what? You saved me like this.

587
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,844
It's just a dream.

588
01:13:55,837 --> 01:13:58,840
In reality, I'm only a mere soldier.

589
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,759
Don't worry.

590
01:14:00,759 --> 01:14:04,162
I will promote you to officer.

591
01:14:04,162 --> 01:14:06,155
I promise.

592
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,576
That's not what I want to hear right now.

593
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:25,809
I wish you were my husband.

594
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:28,561
All the women in the world

595
01:14:28,561 --> 01:14:32,457
are jealous of you for marrying the commander.

596
01:14:32,457 --> 01:14:35,576
The commander is just a commander.

597
01:14:36,586 --> 01:14:38,913
He's not a man.

598
01:14:44,636 --> 01:14:45,978
What?

599
01:14:49,182 --> 01:14:51,960
Are you craving anything?

600
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,421
Let's have a feast today.

601
01:14:56,397 --> 01:14:59,275
What do you want? I'll make it.

602
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:01,680
I must serve the people.

603
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,990
I will cook for you.

604
01:15:04,989 --> 01:15:06,933
Sure. The people.

605
01:15:06,933 --> 01:15:10,829
Only the people can create great history.

606
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:12,205
Let's cook quickly.

607
01:15:12,205 --> 01:15:15,558
Let's see who cooks better.

608
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:17,226
- Ready?
- Yes.

609
01:15:38,523 --> 01:15:41,267
I think what I made tastes better.

610
01:15:42,944 --> 01:15:45,321
No way! What I made tastes better!

611
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:47,820
Remember? I was sent here to work.

612
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,590
That means I'm the best cook!

613
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,750
Humility makes people progress,

614
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,870
but arrogance makes them regress.

615
01:15:57,417 --> 01:16:01,337
You've delighted the eyes
of the people!

616
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:04,424
Your soup is beyond comparison!

617
01:16:04,424 --> 01:16:08,252
I'll never be able to make such a beautiful, delicious dish.

618
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:32,184
Have you ever tried wild ginseng ale?

619
01:16:32,911 --> 01:16:34,412
I saw someone drink it.

620
01:16:34,412 --> 01:16:36,789
When the Scud missile test was successful,

621
01:16:36,789 --> 01:16:41,377
I saw the commander drink it to celebrate with other officials.

622
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:43,213
Let's drink it.

623
01:16:43,213 --> 01:16:45,214
Let's celebrate too!

624
01:16:45,215 --> 01:16:47,075
Celebrate what?

625
01:16:47,075 --> 01:16:51,195
That I didn't live my life in vain all this time.

626
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:22,877
If I drink this,

627
01:17:22,877 --> 01:17:26,906
tell me how you came to marry the commander.

628
01:17:26,906 --> 01:17:29,409
Do you really want to know?

629
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:31,193
Drink it.

630
01:18:16,764 --> 01:18:18,732
You know, too.

631
01:18:19,334 --> 01:18:23,922
I'm an avid student of the Premier's books.

632
01:18:23,922 --> 01:18:29,743
I was the best of all female soldiers in memorizing the Premier's quotes.

633
01:18:31,362 --> 01:18:36,284
I once recited more than 100 quotes before the commander

634
01:18:36,284 --> 01:18:39,162
without a single mistake.

635
01:18:39,162 --> 01:18:41,998
He told me right there

636
01:18:41,998 --> 01:18:45,668
that he was really impressed by me.

637
01:18:47,337 --> 01:18:50,514
That's why I married the commander.

638
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,410
That's it?

639
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:59,207
I really wanted to get married to the commander.

640
01:18:59,207 --> 01:19:02,818
He treated me like a true gentleman.

641
01:19:03,528 --> 01:19:08,466
But the commander is just a commander.

642
01:19:08,466 --> 01:19:11,827
I never dreamed he would not be a man.

643
01:19:17,658 --> 01:19:19,452
Yes, Commander!

644
01:19:19,452 --> 01:19:21,904
Yes, Sir!

645
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:29,728
He was only fourteen when he entered the Party.

646
01:19:30,738 --> 01:19:34,492
He was injured four times during the anti-Japanese war.

647
01:19:34,492 --> 01:19:39,097
During the War of National Liberation, bullets struck through his groin.

648
01:19:39,097 --> 01:19:42,750
There are still two bullets left inside his body

649
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,420
so he has a boxful of Order of Merit.

650
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:53,611
Do you think I can divorce the commander?

651
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:55,279
You shouldn't have married him in the first place.

652
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:58,574
His hair turned grey while fighting for the revolution.

653
01:19:58,574 --> 01:20:01,419
But he knelt before me and cried like a child.

654
01:20:01,419 --> 01:20:04,471
How could I not marry him?

655
01:20:08,543 --> 01:20:10,711
Let's have another drink.

656
01:20:10,711 --> 01:20:13,047
If you drink this,

657
01:20:13,047 --> 01:20:16,300
I'll recite 100 quotes by the Premier.

658
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,553
If you can't drink this,

659
01:20:18,553 --> 01:20:21,431
you'll have to recite 100 quotes.

660
01:20:21,431 --> 01:20:25,267

Why aren't you standing guard?

686
01:25:17,435 --> 01:25:18,936
To the training court, Sir.

687
01:25:18,936 --> 01:25:20,896
It's an emergency. Didn't you know?

688
01:25:20,896 --> 01:25:22,273
Will no one take your shift?

689
01:25:22,273 --> 01:25:24,015
No, Sir.

690
01:25:29,246 --> 01:25:30,156
What's happening?

691
01:25:30,156 --> 01:25:33,384
Didn't your squadron soldiers tell you before they left?

692
01:25:33,384 --> 01:25:35,077
Right. I heard.

693
01:25:35,077 --> 01:25:37,896
<i>Turn around!</i>

694
01:25:39,081 --> 01:25:41,658

695
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:58,540
<i> March forward!</i>

696
01:26:17,787 --> 01:26:30,549
<i>Away with American imperialism!</i>

697
01:26:43,646 --> 01:26:44,688
Here, Sir.

698
01:26:55,825 --> 01:26:57,243
I can't take that!

699
01:26:57,243 --> 01:27:01,196
I saved it from bartering. Please send it to my wife.

700
01:27:01,196 --> 01:27:02,672
Okay.

701
01:27:05,376 --> 01:27:06,752
Here.

702
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,921
No need to pay me.

703
01:27:09,713 --> 01:27:12,032
- It's an empty envelope.
-What?

704
01:27:12,032 --> 01:27:16,262
You asked for an envelope for officers to write a letter to your son.

705
01:27:16,262 --> 01:27:18,556
Oh, right!

706
01:27:18,556 --> 01:27:22,067
It'll look good for him to receive it in this.

707
01:27:24,061 --> 01:27:25,887
By the way,

708
01:27:26,989 --> 01:27:28,898
did you hear?

709
01:27:30,025 --> 01:27:33,404
<i>I heard there's trouble at the border.</i>

710
01:27:33,404 --> 01:27:36,472
<i>What do you mean?</i>

711
01:27:36,472 --> 01:27:39,000
<i>It's just a rumor I heard.</i>

712
01:27:39,702 --> 01:27:41,444
Open up!

713
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:48,326
There's poo on your head, Sir.

714
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:51,338
Do you know who I am?

715
01:27:52,172 --> 01:27:55,009
Even the warden salutes me now.

716
01:27:55,009 --> 01:27:57,461
Even my captain asks me for favors!

717
01:27:57,461 --> 01:28:00,356
How dare a new soldier talk to me like that!

718
01:28:00,356 --> 01:28:04,876
I know, Sir. You're Shin Mu Gwang, a model soldier, Sir.

719
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:16,220
I work at the commander's residence.

720
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:19,020
If you need anything, let me know anytime.

721
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:21,751
I shall keep watch, Sir!

722
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:24,163
You're only supposed to salute like that to the commander!

723
01:28:24,163 --> 01:28:29,180
I know, Sir, but you seem as high as the sky to me!

724
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:39,230
Eat it.

725
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:43,860
Pine nuts contain essential fat for the human body.

726
01:29:05,746 --> 01:29:08,423
Hey! Wash this for me.

727
01:29:10,376 --> 01:29:11,418
What?

728
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:13,562
I'm so hot.

729
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:16,055
Please go and wash my clothes.

730
01:29:25,099 --> 01:29:26,625
What about the pine nuts!

731
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:32,147
I... forgot to buy them.

732
01:29:32,147 --> 01:29:34,900
What did you give the guard at the gates?

733
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,980
Did you monitor me with binoculars?

734
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:40,550
I was watching and waiting for you.

735
01:30:01,301 --> 01:30:03,012
You said you were my wife. Can't you do my laundry?

736
01:30:03,012 --> 01:30:05,472
Even the commander never called me, saying, "hey."

737
01:30:05,472 --> 01:30:08,942
And how can you tell me to do it without even looking at me?

738
01:30:09,727 --> 01:30:12,737
Let go of me!

739
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:20,687
What did you just do?

740
01:30:23,449 --> 01:30:25,826
The Premier gave this to me.

741
01:30:25,826 --> 01:30:27,453
It fell because you hit it with your arm.

742
01:30:27,453 --> 01:30:30,122
You picked me up by force.

743
01:30:30,122 --> 01:30:33,867
If I call the authorities, your life will be over.

744
01:30:34,626 --> 01:30:36,086
Could you do that?

745
01:30:36,086 --> 01:30:38,338
I can do it or not as I choose.

746
01:30:38,338 --> 01:30:40,049
You told me to come upstairs!

747
01:30:40,049 --> 01:30:42,634
Since when did I tell you to come upstairs?

748
01:30:42,634 --> 01:30:45,512
You pointed to the Serve the People plaque in the kitchen just now!

749
01:30:45,512 --> 01:30:49,516
I meant for you to look at it and come to your senses!

750
01:30:49,516 --> 01:30:52,911
I didn't move the plaque from its original location.

751
01:31:19,296 --> 01:31:21,381
This means you forgive?

752
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:04,007
Do you forgive me?

753
01:32:05,592 --> 01:32:07,386
If so, that means I did something wrong.

754
01:32:07,386 --> 01:32:10,139
No. I was wrong.

755
01:32:10,139 --> 01:32:12,307
You're putting the blame on me!

756
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:14,268
I'm sorry.

757
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:17,190
Do you enjoy having power?

758
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:19,280
Do you like using your power?

759
01:32:20,691 --> 01:32:22,760
Curse at me more.

760
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,111
Fuck.

761
01:32:24,111 --> 01:32:26,655
Hit me.

762
01:32:26,655 --> 01:32:28,465
Slap me once.

763
01:32:32,077 --> 01:32:33,836
Harder.

764
01:33:21,919 --> 01:33:24,296
Do you think you're the commander?

765
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:27,665
Do you think you're the Premier?

766
01:34:12,052 --> 01:34:15,638
I have worse origins than you.

767
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:19,980
Thanks to that, my family split up

768
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:22,310
and faced death many times.

769
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:27,709
Some have even died.

770
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:37,786
The barracks are empty.

771
01:34:37,786 --> 01:34:44,375
I wish we could live out the rest of our lives locked up in this building while naked.

772
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,370
I wish I could eat and sleep here,

773
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:54,360
naked like this, with you.

774
01:34:55,554 --> 01:34:59,516
When the commander returns,

775
01:34:59,516 --> 01:35:05,588
I'll quit being a cook and do any work at the base.

776
01:35:07,691 --> 01:35:09,559
Why?

777
01:35:10,152 --> 01:35:13,579
Could I dare meet the commander?

778
01:35:14,197 --> 01:35:17,358
How can I dare face the commander?

779
01:35:18,702 --> 01:35:21,054
I want to live, too.

780
01:35:26,251 --> 01:35:29,053
What did you buy at the market?

781
01:35:30,464 --> 01:35:33,524
Oil, salt...

782
01:35:34,593 --> 01:35:37,420
Soy sauce, vinegar...

783
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:40,957
How long can we eat with that?

784
01:35:42,017 --> 01:35:45,344
It'll last us more than a month.

785
01:36:24,684 --> 01:36:25,769
It's me.

786
01:36:25,769 --> 01:36:28,730
When are the warden and captain returning to the base?

787
01:36:31,066 --> 01:36:35,612
What training is it that they took my security soldiers?

788
01:36:35,612 --> 01:36:38,131
Without even telling me!

789
01:36:38,131 --> 01:36:43,787
I'm scared to be alone, so I'll make Shin keep watch at night.

790
01:36:43,787 --> 01:36:46,540
Tell them to expect a word from me!

791
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:48,224
Understood?

792
01:36:59,553 --> 01:37:02,004
Why are you dressed?

793
01:37:03,181 --> 01:37:05,149
Look at me.

794
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:19,617
What's wrong?

795
01:39:21,403 --> 01:39:23,530
I'm so tired.

796
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:28,184
Maybe you're not tired, but tired of me?

797
01:39:29,035 --> 01:39:32,889
I'm not even hungry or sleepy anymore.

798
01:39:32,889 --> 01:39:37,627
After being naked for three days, I want to get dressed now.

799
01:39:37,627 --> 01:39:40,496
I want to go out and take a walk too.

800
01:39:43,008 --> 01:39:46,870
May I go out and plant some vegetables?

801
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:51,849
Fine. Wear clothes. You don't have to ever take them off.

802
01:40:22,005 --> 01:40:23,340
Hello?

803
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,758
Operator! Operator!

804
01:40:25,759 --> 01:40:26,968
What are you doing?

805
01:40:26,968 --> 01:40:30,305
I'm calling the authorities!

806
01:40:30,305 --> 01:40:32,182
Go ahead and try!

807
01:40:32,182 --> 01:40:35,183
Ryu Su Ryeon! You heartless, disloyal woman!

808
01:40:35,183 --> 01:40:37,136
You whore!

809
01:40:37,896 --> 01:40:39,497
What?

810
01:40:40,565 --> 01:40:43,151
Go ahead and call the authorities!

811
01:40:43,151 --> 01:40:45,569
Don't think I can?

812
01:41:03,963 --> 01:41:09,059
I purposely left the plaster figure under your clothes.

813
01:41:10,303 --> 01:41:16,935
I knew it'd break when you pulled out your clothes.

814
01:41:16,935 --> 01:41:19,136
I did it on purpose.

815
01:41:29,614 --> 01:41:35,044
Please forget that I called you a whore.

816
01:41:57,934 --> 01:41:59,985
Mu Gwang.

817
01:42:01,271 --> 01:42:03,889
Do you want to marry me?

818
01:42:06,443 --> 01:42:08,136
Yes.

819
01:42:08,136 --> 01:42:10,546
I want to marry you, too.

820
01:42:11,906 --> 01:42:14,742
But that's impossible.

821
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:24,243
You don't want to leave the commander's side, right?

822
01:42:25,754 --> 01:42:28,222
You're attached to him.

823
01:42:34,137 --> 01:42:37,290
You have your wife and kid too.

824
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:40,944
I'm satisfied with the thought that you want to marry me.

825
01:42:40,944 --> 01:42:45,756
I'll promote you to an officer no matter what.

826
01:42:46,941 --> 01:42:49,460
Whether you do or not,

827
01:42:50,403 --> 01:42:54,991
I'll be thankful to you for the rest of my life.

828
01:42:54,991 --> 01:42:58,377
I'll cherish you deep in my heart.

829
01:42:59,037 --> 01:43:01,122
Such sweet talk...

830
01:43:01,122 --> 01:43:03,140
You don't believe me?

831
01:43:04,417 --> 01:43:07,295
If you don't, call the authorities and report me anytime.

832
01:43:07,295 --> 01:43:11,983
If you do, I'll be shot to death or spend my life in prison.

833
01:43:11,983 --> 01:43:14,886
Because you say you can't forget me,

834
01:43:14,886 --> 01:43:18,314
do you think I will also not forget you?

835
01:43:19,098 --> 01:43:21,709
Since you're the commander's wife,

836
01:43:22,268 --> 01:43:26,397
there's nothing I can do if you forget me.

837
01:43:26,397 --> 01:43:28,983
Do you want me to swear I won't?

838
01:43:28,983 --> 01:43:33,203
Words of promise and swearing are useless.

839
01:43:42,163 --> 01:43:43,790
What are you doing?

840
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:49,128
Now, can you believe me?

841
01:43:49,128 --> 01:43:53,132
If you can't, report me to the authorities.

842
01:43:53,132 --> 01:43:57,178
We're both avid students of the Premier's books

843
01:43:57,178 --> 01:43:59,514
who damaged his portraits.

844
01:43:59,514 --> 01:44:02,559
You broke his statue by accident,

845
01:44:02,559 --> 01:44:04,936
but I broke his portrait on purpose!

846
01:44:04,936 --> 01:44:09,173
Thus, I'm a great anti-revolutionary, and you're a minor one.

847
01:44:09,983 --> 01:44:12,925
Now, can you believe Shin Mu Gwang

848
01:44:12,925 --> 01:44:17,131
will live in Ryu Su Ryeon's heart forever?

849
01:44:48,521 --> 01:44:51,791
I'm an anti-revolutionary.

850
01:44:51,791 --> 01:44:54,702
I deserve to be executed twice.

851
01:45:04,245 --> 01:45:07,981
Are you a greater rebel or am I?

852
01:45:21,387 --> 01:45:23,056
Do you think you can beat me?

853
01:45:23,056 --> 01:45:24,815
Of course!

854
01:45:42,241 --> 01:45:45,060
Do you think you can win?

855
01:46:59,027 --> 01:47:00,194
Spare this.

856
01:47:00,194 --> 01:47:02,030
What for?

857
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:04,282
Just spare it.

858
01:47:04,282 --> 01:47:08,619
Then you'll have to admit that I'm the greatest anti-revolutionary.

859
01:47:08,619 --> 01:47:12,665
the ultimate female spy in the Party,

860
01:47:12,665 --> 01:47:16,711
more powerful than the atomic bomb buried in the line of revolution,

861
01:47:16,711 --> 01:47:19,297
and ten times stronger than a hydrogen bomb,

862
01:47:19,297 --> 01:47:22,909
that I'm an unconscionable time bomb,

863
01:47:22,909 --> 01:47:27,221
and more than Shin Mu Gwang's love for me, Ryu Su Ryeon,

864
01:47:27,221 --> 01:47:31,768
Ryu Su Ryeon's love for Shin Mu Gwang

865
01:47:31,768 --> 01:47:35,254
is a hundred times stronger.

866
01:47:35,254 --> 01:47:37,514
What if I can't?

867
01:47:38,733 --> 01:47:44,079
If you can't, I'll smash this to pieces.

868
01:47:46,365 --> 01:47:50,244
Okay. I concede.

869
01:47:50,244 --> 01:47:53,556
Then repeat what I say three times.

870
01:47:53,556 --> 01:47:57,359
More than Shin Mu Gwang's love for Ryu Su Ryeon,

871
01:47:58,044 --> 01:48:01,672
Ryu Su Ryeon's love for Shin Mu Gwang

872
01:48:01,672 --> 01:48:06,376
is a hundred, a thousand, a million times stronger.

873
01:48:08,679 --> 01:48:11,182
More than Shin Mu Gwang's love for Ryu Su Ryeon,

874
01:48:12,308 --> 01:48:14,769
Ryu Su Ryeon's love for Shin Mu Gwang

875
01:48:14,769 --> 01:48:18,731
is a hundred, a thousand, a million times stronger.

876
01:48:19,982 --> 01:48:22,777
More than Shin Mu Gwang's love for Ryu Su Ryeon,

877
01:48:22,777 --> 01:48:25,071
Ryu Su Ryeon's love for Shin Mu Gwang

878
01:48:25,071 --> 01:48:29,124
is a hundred, a thousand, a million times stronger!

879
01:48:31,911 --> 01:48:34,622
More than Shin Mu Gwang's love for Ryu Su Ryeon,

880
01:48:34,622 --> 01:48:36,874
Ryu Su Ryeon's love for Shin Mu Gwang

881
01:48:36,874 --> 01:48:41,812
is a hundred, a thousand, a million times stronger!

882
01:48:47,885 --> 01:48:53,432
My dear man, I am hungry.

883
01:48:53,432 --> 01:48:55,092
My dear wife,

884
01:48:56,185 --> 01:48:58,937
I shall prepare food for you.

885
01:49:00,481 --> 01:49:05,361
My good man, I'm thirsty.

886
01:49:06,404 --> 01:49:08,322
My good wife,

887
01:49:09,073 --> 01:49:11,600
I shall bring you water.

888
01:49:12,451 --> 01:49:15,295
I'm a bit cold.

889
01:49:21,878 --> 01:49:23,962
Wear more clothes.

890
01:49:24,755 --> 01:49:28,426
No. I don't want to.

891
01:49:28,426 --> 01:49:30,752
Then what now?

892
01:50:37,286 --> 01:50:40,331
I came to pick fresh vegetables to make food for you,

893
01:50:40,331 --> 01:50:42,416
but I got distracted.

894
01:50:42,416 --> 01:50:45,069
I'll take any punishment you give me.

895
01:50:46,754 --> 01:50:49,398
It's so bright.

896
01:50:49,398 --> 01:50:52,160
It's a full moon.

897
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:55,788
How many days have we been sleeping?

898
01:50:55,788 --> 01:50:59,100
Mu Gwang, do you miss home?

899
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:02,378
What soldier thinks of home?

900
01:51:02,378 --> 01:51:05,922
Don't you miss your wife and son?

901
01:51:07,191 --> 01:51:10,268
Is there something that worries you?

902
01:51:10,803 --> 01:51:13,680
I think I'm pregnant.

903
01:51:20,037 --> 01:51:21,455
What did you just say?

904
01:51:21,455 --> 01:51:22,999
I didn't say anything.

905
01:51:22,999 --> 01:51:25,251
You said you think you're pregnant.

906
01:51:25,251 --> 01:51:28,713
Yes, I said I could be pregnant,

907
01:51:28,713 --> 01:51:31,640
but I may not be.

908
01:51:32,675 --> 01:51:34,010
What?

909
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:38,264
I have my period around this time every month.

910
01:51:38,264 --> 01:51:42,268
But I didn't get it this month.

911
01:51:42,268 --> 01:51:47,356
Because we rolled around like crazy in bed,

912
01:51:47,356 --> 01:51:52,811
my menstrual cycle could be pushed back a few days.

913
01:51:55,072 --> 01:51:56,657
Mu Gwang...

914
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:02,647
The commander's meeting ended earlier than expected.

915
01:52:02,647 --> 01:52:05,224
He'll return tomorrow.

916
01:52:05,224 --> 01:52:06,934
Tomorrow?

917
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,821
Did he call you?

918
01:52:10,821 --> 01:52:13,482
Didn't you hear the ring?

919
01:52:16,093 --> 01:52:18,036
My lady.

920
01:52:21,515 --> 01:52:24,526
I want to go back home.

921
01:52:30,191 --> 01:52:31,859
Are you afraid?

922
01:52:31,859 --> 01:52:34,462
Don't be afraid of anything.

923
01:52:34,462 --> 01:52:40,268
I'll see to it that it appears like nothing ever happened.

924
01:52:40,268 --> 01:52:43,371
And I'll give you a long vacation.

925
01:52:43,371 --> 01:52:49,101
Go home and stay with your wife and son.

926
01:52:49,101 --> 01:52:54,614
Don't return here until you get a letter or a call from the base.

927
01:53:06,936 --> 01:53:10,648
You can do whatever you want tonight.

928
01:53:10,648 --> 01:53:14,677
Think of me as your wife back home.

929
01:53:14,677 --> 01:53:19,490
I want to do my best for you on our last night.

930
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:22,768
So you won't ever forget me,

931
01:53:22,768 --> 01:53:26,488
or my body for the rest of your life.

932
01:53:32,253 --> 01:53:36,732
Buy your wife some clothes on your way home.

933
01:53:36,732 --> 01:53:40,718
Buy your son some toys and food as well.

934
01:53:50,604 --> 01:53:54,322
Noonim. Will I ever see you again?

935
01:53:58,362 --> 01:54:02,123
Go. The truck is waiting outside.

936
01:54:35,742 --> 01:54:38,870
- Keep it safe with you.
- Yes, Sir.

937
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:42,364
Take it with you even to the bathroom.

938
01:54:44,851 --> 01:54:46,577
Stop the car!

939
01:55:05,663 --> 01:55:07,223
Go.

940
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:31,921
All clear on duty, Sir!

941
01:55:58,607 --> 01:56:01,150
- Leave it there and go.
- I beg your pardon, Sir?

942
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:03,612
Leave it there and scram!

943
01:56:03,612 --> 01:56:05,730
Yes, Sir!

944
01:56:53,037 --> 01:56:55,372
Is something wrong?

945
01:56:57,958 --> 01:57:00,477
What do you mean?

946
01:57:01,879 --> 01:57:05,607
It's weird that you don't want to do it.

947
01:57:06,467 --> 01:57:11,588
Is it because there wasn't much progress in the last six months?

948
01:57:13,849 --> 01:57:18,803
I wrote a pledge to you in blood.

949
01:57:19,396 --> 01:57:22,483
If I am not promoted to an officer,

950
01:57:22,483 --> 01:57:26,836
I won't touch you even if I should return home.

951
01:57:27,821 --> 01:57:31,841
After five years, I'm still not an officer.

952
01:57:35,496 --> 01:57:39,792
What are you doing? Give it to me.

953
01:57:39,792 --> 01:57:42,044
Why get your hands wet!

954
01:57:42,044 --> 01:57:44,613
Get out. Go on.

955
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,065
Just go.

956
01:57:59,061 --> 01:58:01,063
What are you doing!

957
01:58:01,063 --> 01:58:03,573
A man shouldn't do this!

958
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:17,821
It's 3:00 a.m. What are you doing?

959
01:58:21,208 --> 01:58:24,712
I was just thinking of my base.

960
01:58:24,712 --> 01:58:29,891
Staying home does not feel comfortable as being on the base.

961
01:58:32,678 --> 01:58:34,720
Hurry and come down.

962
01:58:54,283 --> 01:58:55,984
Kids!

963
01:58:57,327 --> 01:58:58,912
Wait.

964
01:59:33,447 --> 01:59:34,864
Wait!

965
01:59:34,865 --> 01:59:37,367
Is there a letter for me?

966
01:59:37,367 --> 01:59:39,077
No, there isn't!

967
01:59:39,077 --> 01:59:41,288
How about a telegram?

968
01:59:41,288 --> 01:59:45,530
I told you if anything comes, I'll get it to you even if it's in the middle of the night!

969
01:59:45,530 --> 01:59:48,010
Jeez.

970
02:00:13,028 --> 02:00:16,073
- Wait!
- Go away!

971
02:00:23,747 --> 02:00:27,125
Are you sure there is no letter or telegram for me?

972
02:00:27,125 --> 02:00:30,170
Damn it! Have you gone mad?

973
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:34,800
Why didn't you get it treated for free on the base?

974
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:38,578
My hat! Damn it!

It's okay.

It's okay, son.

I don't understand it at all.

02:02:36,922 --> 02:02:40,507
Mu Gwang! Your vacation is over.

987
02:02:40,507 --> 02:02:43,845
Why haven't you returned to base?

988
02:02:45,931 --> 02:02:52,870
Did you cause a problem and get kicked out?

989
02:02:53,814 --> 02:02:58,734
If not, then go back now.

990
02:02:58,735 --> 02:03:00,487

991
02:03:02,698 --> 02:03:04,349
Why you!

992
02:03:05,575 --> 02:03:08,787
I must've been crazy!

993
02:03:08,787 --> 02:03:15,084
Why did I give my daughter to a fool like you!

994
02:03:15,084 --> 02:03:16,795
I don't believe this!

995
02:03:17,963 --> 02:03:19,131

996

Fuck!

1012
02:04:49,721 --> 02:04:51,348
Hey! Communication Soldier!

1013
02:04:51,348 --> 02:04:54,184
What is going on here?

1014
02:04:54,184 --> 02:04:57,320
Hey! Hey, punk!

1015
02:04:59,773 --> 02:05:00,982
Shin Mu Gwang!

1016
02:05:00,982 --> 02:05:03,926
We didn't call you back. Why did you come?

1017
02:05:07,948 --> 02:05:11,910
During the commander's military talks,

1018
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:16,339
some of our soldiers killed two U.S. soldiers with pickaxes.

1019
02:05:17,582 --> 02:05:19,151
What?

1020
02:05:19,151 --> 02:05:23,296
The commander who ordered it volunteered to take responsibility.

1021
02:05:23,296 --> 02:05:25,882
What does that mean?

1022
02:05:27,092 --> 02:05:30,137
Our division will disappear

1023
02:05:30,137 --> 02:05:32,973
like smoke from the Central Military Commission.

1024
02:05:32,973 --> 02:05:34,725
Why? When heroes killed the Americans?

1025
02:05:34,725 --> 02:05:38,186
We almost went to war with the U.S.

1026
02:05:38,186 --> 02:05:42,381
So when the entire division left, it wasn't for training?

1027
02:05:44,943 --> 02:05:48,238
Then what will happen to me?

1028
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:50,257
In the end,

1029
02:05:50,257 --> 02:05:55,127
the officer position you so wanted, has gone down the drain.

1030
02:06:00,083 --> 02:06:02,218
Damn bastards!

1031
02:06:02,878 --> 02:06:06,562
- Then I'm...
- You will no longer work at the commander's residence.

1032
02:06:06,562 --> 02:06:10,067
Wait here for further instructions. Understood?

1033
02:06:11,219 --> 02:06:15,131
Don't go near the commander's residence.

1034
02:06:26,943 --> 02:06:31,798
How can he dissolve the division and the soldiers to save himself?

1035
02:06:31,798 --> 02:06:34,017
Can you call that a commander?

1036
02:06:34,017 --> 02:06:36,853
He's no commander!

1037
02:06:36,853 --> 02:06:39,080
Someone could hear you, Sir.

1038
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:41,590

1041
02:06:53,053 --> 02:06:55,187
Because we're soldiers, Sir.

- The fate of soldiers...
- Shut up, you fool!

1043
02:07:14,991 --> 02:07:16,884
Do you want to die?

1044
02:07:17,786 --> 02:07:19,595
Come inside!

Shin Mu Gwang!

1046
02:07:23,333 --> 02:07:27,295
Have you forgotten that you're the son of a peasant?

1047
02:07:27,295 --> 02:07:31,615
Did you forget you're dealing with the commander's wife?

1048
02:07:34,511 --> 02:07:37,305
Not only did the commander spare you punishment...

<i>Oh, Shin Mu Gwang!</i>

1050
02:07:39,683 --> 02:07:43,728
Don't worry and go home. The others don't know.

Here you are!

1052
02:07:45,922 --> 02:07:49,401
You owe me a drink.

02:07:49,401 --> 02:07:54,872
The Party has approved of your new job and will move your family to the city.

1054
02:07:55,573 --> 02:07:56,908
Really, Sir?

1055
02:07:56,908 --> 02:07:57,826
Yes.

02:07:57,826 --> 02:07:59,869
Upon Madam's recommendation,

1057
02:07:59,869 --> 02:08:05,525
your family will work at the largest electricity plant in the city.

Do you know what's even more surprising?

1059
02:08:07,335 --> 02:08:11,697
You'll be the new manager of the plant.

1060
02:08:12,882 --> 02:08:15,109
Do you still not believe me?

1061
02:08:15,885 --> 02:08:22,024
A plant manager is general-level with more pay than a corps commander!

1062
02:08:24,144 --> 02:08:25,603
Go and pack.

1063
02:08:25,603 --> 02:08:28,773
You must report to your post in two days.

1064
02:08:28,773 --> 02:08:32,193
You'll have to take the night train to arrive there on time.

02:09:47,227 --> 02:09:50,111
- Congratulations, Sir.
- Congratulations, Sir.

1080
02:09:50,111 --> 02:09:51,872
Congratulations, Sir.

1081
02:09:58,613 --> 02:10:00,731
Let go of his hand.

1082
02:10:29,853 --> 02:10:31,804
Please stop the car!

1083
02:10:33,097 --> 02:10:35,108
- Why?
- Shin Mu Gwang!

1084
02:10:35,108 --> 02:10:37,184
Stop right there!

1085
02:10:39,529 --> 02:10:42,323
If you set foot in the residence, I'll punish you!

1086
02:10:42,323 --> 02:10:43,908
Don't forget you're still a soldier!

1087
02:10:43,908 --> 02:10:46,619
Your new register will be sent out tomorrow!

1088
02:10:46,619 --> 02:10:49,164
The commander will still be in his office.

1089
02:10:49,164 --> 02:10:53,568
Let's allow Mu Gwang to go and say goodbye.

1090
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:56,362
It's the right thing to do.

1091
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:12,587
I've always told tales or said conventional things to people.

1092
02:11:12,587 --> 02:11:17,692
But since you're leaving today, I'll be honest with you.

1093
02:11:17,692 --> 02:11:23,865
No matter what people say, the ultimate goal is to live well.

1094
02:11:23,865 --> 02:11:28,286
Those from working peasant families want to rise in rank to officers.

1095
02:11:28,286 --> 02:11:34,016
Those born to ordinary officer families want to reach higher ranks.

1096
02:11:38,004 --> 02:11:39,948
Mu Gwang.

1097
02:11:39,948 --> 02:11:43,968
There is one last favor I want to ask you.

1098
02:11:43,968 --> 02:11:48,932
I knew there was something between you and Madam a long time ago.

1099
02:11:48,932 --> 02:11:52,310
But I didn't tell anyone for your sake.

1100
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:53,353
Not only that,

1101
02:11:53,353 --> 02:11:57,690
I even stopped your senior from reporting you.

1102
02:11:57,690 --> 02:11:59,692
If he did, we'd all be dead.

1103
02:11:59,692 --> 02:12:01,277
So when you go inside,

1104
02:12:01,277 --> 02:12:03,863
tell her that I've made no mistakes

1105
02:12:03,863 --> 02:12:06,699
and was recognized as a model warden every year.

1106
02:12:06,699 --> 02:12:11,062
Please tell her that I'm a man of outstanding political ideals.

1107
02:12:11,062 --> 02:12:18,253
I heard today that they've decided to discharge me.

1108
02:12:18,253 --> 02:12:19,879
Really, Sir?

1109
02:12:19,879 --> 02:12:24,467
Next year will be my twenty-fifth year, so I can be a battalion warden.

1110
02:12:24,467 --> 02:12:26,052
I can't be discharged.

1111
02:12:27,178 --> 02:12:32,917
If I become a battalion warden, my wife can live in a residence too.

1112
02:12:34,435 --> 02:12:37,304
I can't be discharged now...

1113
02:12:40,108 --> 02:12:42,059
Let's go in.

1114
02:12:45,947 --> 02:12:48,449
I'll be honest.

1115
02:12:48,449 --> 02:12:52,495
I made a pledge as I married my wife

1116
02:12:52,495 --> 02:12:56,440
that I'll have her live in a residence no matter what.

1117
02:13:00,336 --> 02:13:02,839
I know it's not the right time,

1118
02:13:02,839 --> 02:13:07,176
but mention me to Madam?

1119
02:13:07,176 --> 02:13:08,936
Please?

1120
02:13:18,313 --> 02:13:20,180
I report!

1121
02:13:21,065 --> 02:13:23,192
I report!

1122
02:13:23,192 --> 02:13:24,901
<i>Who is there?</i>

1123
02:13:24,902 --> 02:13:26,487
It's me.

1124
02:13:26,487 --> 02:13:29,340
The warden, Ma'am.

1125
02:13:30,617 --> 02:13:36,247
Ma'am, as a warden, I am careful and sensible.

1126
02:13:36,247 --> 02:13:40,168
When I work, like the rain moistening the ground,

1127
02:13:40,168 --> 02:13:44,121
I handle things accordingly to the situation and time.

1128
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:54,131
Go in.

1129
02:13:57,518 --> 02:13:58,978
Go.

1130
02:15:06,337 --> 02:15:09,406
Go inside and mention me.

1131
02:15:43,207 --> 02:15:44,500
What is it?

1132
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:46,760
It's what you want.

1133
02:15:59,432 --> 02:16:03,816
Noonim. Can I ask you a favor?

1134
02:16:05,730 --> 02:16:08,733
Seeing how the warden escorted you here,

1135
02:16:08,733 --> 02:16:12,803
he must want you to ask me to help him stay in the army, right?

1136
02:16:14,530 --> 02:16:19,167
I'm sorry, but I can't help him with that.

1137
02:16:20,745 --> 02:16:23,623
Tell your captain and the warden

1138
02:16:23,623 --> 02:16:28,069
to come to me for help once discharged.

1139
02:16:28,069 --> 02:16:32,197
The commander will return from his office soon.

1140
02:16:53,736 --> 02:16:55,604
Now, go.

1141
02:16:58,574 --> 02:17:00,535
Warden.

1142
02:17:00,535 --> 02:17:04,071
Go and make sure he doesn't miss the train.

1143
02:18:57,540 --> 02:19:00,110
<i>[Fifteen Years Later]</i>

1144
02:19:00,112 --> 02:19:01,730
To the right.

1145
02:19:02,949 --> 02:19:04,824
More to the right.

1146
02:19:04,825 --> 02:19:06,752
That's it.

1147
02:19:18,089 --> 02:19:20,582
Are you all right, Manager?

1148
02:19:24,095 --> 02:19:26,180
Are you all right, Sir?

1149
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:28,265
Are you sure you're okay?

1150
02:19:28,265 --> 02:19:30,676
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry, Sir.

1151
02:19:31,519 --> 02:19:33,429
Please go to the hospital.

1152
02:21:15,039 --> 02:21:17,316
May I help you, Sir?

1153
02:21:17,316 --> 02:21:20,294
I've come to see the lady of the house.

1154
02:21:20,294 --> 02:21:23,631
When the general was a commander fifteen years ago,

1155
02:21:23,631 --> 02:21:26,291
I was a cook in his residence.

1156
02:21:28,052 --> 02:21:29,712
Do you have an appointment?

1157
02:21:29,712 --> 02:21:33,766
If I didn't, how would I have passed the gates?

1158
02:21:33,766 --> 02:21:38,712
Please tell Madam that Shin Mu Gwang is standing outside the door.

1159
02:22:00,376 --> 02:22:04,088
She says she's getting her hair done and can't come out.

1160
02:22:04,088 --> 02:22:08,050
She said you can't come inside either, and asked to read her letter.

1161
02:22:08,050 --> 02:22:11,645
She said if you need anything, she'll take care of it.

1162
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:24,199
Please give this to Noonim Su Ryeon.

1163
02:22:24,942 --> 02:22:27,577
What? Noonim?

1164
02:22:44,562 --> 02:22:48,975
<i>If you need my help, write it on this paper.</i>

1165
02:22:48,975 --> 02:22:55,113
<i>If you need money, write the exact amount and the address to send it to.</i>

1166
02:24:35,739 --> 02:24:38,191
Then I'll go here.

1167
02:24:42,788 --> 02:24:44,940
I'll take this.

1168
02:24:46,583 --> 02:24:49,177
I'm going to visit my hometown.

1169
02:24:50,254 --> 02:24:54,691
Though my parents are gone, I want to visit my siblings.

1170
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:18,160
<i>[That's how Su Ryeon disappeared.]</i>

1171
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:22,340
<i>[No one knows where she went.]</i>

1172
02:25:32,530 --> 02:25:40,000
Thank you our Chief Segmenter "bjohnsonwong"

1173
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:45,120
Thank you to our Chief Editor and her English team

1174
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:50,010

1175

Thank you for watching this movie with us.
