7
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:38,870
I'm only here because your house was the closest.

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,880
Yi Jung would give me grief because of the fight we had in Macau.

9
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:46,152
And at Woo Bin's place, the girls are too loud.

10
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,599
What about the punch I took?

11
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,410
What are you going to do about that?

12
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,010
Uh, fine.

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,450
Hit me. It'll be settled if I let you hit me once.

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,257
Hurry. Hit me.

15
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,720
What's going on with the engagement?

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,530
I don't know.

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,550
How can I know all the machinations of the Old Witch?

18
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:11,980
Engagement, my foot.

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,690
And of all the girls, where did she come up with one like her?

20
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,060
Did everyone,

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,440
get back safely?

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,950
If you're wondering about Jan Di,

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,540
then yes, she made it back safely.

24
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:28,719
Did anyone say I was curious?

25
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:36,516
Hey, it's your friend's birthday and you haven't even given me a present!

26
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:38,702
Hurry up and hand it over.

27
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:46,020
What is this?

28
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:14,530
Goo Joon Pyo, happy birthday.

29
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:21,390
I'll be praying that this birthday is not a lonely one, but one filled with happiness.

30
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,497
Geum Jan Di.

What I said to Joon Pyo in Macau...

32
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,160
I know.

33
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:04,700
You only said it because you were mad at Goo Joon Pyo.

Hey, you, Beef Jerky!

40
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:59,480
I was right. I'm right. The beef jerky girl in Macau, right?

41
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:04,104
Hello. How is it that you're here?

42
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:08,954
Hey. I'm your life saver but you don't seem all that happy to see me.

43
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:11,331
I'm really happy to see you.

44
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:16,972
I'm happy to see you too, but why are you here?

45
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:19,142
I came to look for someone.

46
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:24,660
Goo Joon Pyo?

47
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,210
Oh, how do you know that?

48
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:28,318
Do you know that jerk?

49
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:32,510
Oh right. Your name is...

50
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,891
Jan Di. Geum Jan Di.

51
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:38,160
Oh, Geum Jan Di.

52
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,320
Do you remember my name?

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,399
Ha Jae Kyung.

54
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:47,603
Seeing that you're in a uniform, I take it that you're still in high school.

55
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:49,430
Junior? Senior?

56
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,000
Senior.

57
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,730
I'm going to start attending Shinhwa University. That's great.

58
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,970
Shall we be big sister and little sister?

59
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,151
Oh! You're cute!

60
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:05,391
From the first time I saw you, you really appealed to me, little sister, Jan Di.

61
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:08,124
Little sister Jan Di?

62
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,194
Where is that jerk hiding?

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,780
Why is that girl here?

64
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,803
Oh, I found him!

65
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,120
You found what?

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,278
What do you mean, "What"? My fiancé, of course!

67
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:33,015
You'd better let go!

68
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,952
Why? You don't like my greeting?

69
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:39,054
Then would you rather I bite your ear, like last time?

70
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:48,330
What is this crazy monkey saying? Why don't you just buzz off?!

71
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:53,256
I'm only going to say this once, so don't forget it. My name is Ha Jae Kyung.

72
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:57,238
From today on, I am your fiancée. You got it?

73
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:58,741
And keep in mind.

74
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:00,077
Keep what in mind?

75
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:04,267
From here on, I'm going to tame you.

76
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:29,872
From today on, Joon Pyo is going to be attending Shinhwa University with us.

77
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:36,246
So you're okay, then?

78
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:37,350
About what?

79
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,940
That girl.

80
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,753
That fiancée girl. Doesn't that fiancée bother you when she goes running after Joon Pyo sunbae?

81
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:47,200
What does that have to do with me?

82
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,050
And that unnie...

83
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,690
Unnie?

84
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,397
She seems like a cool person.

85
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:59,020
No, she's a cool person.

86
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,004
Who? Who's a cool person?

87
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:07,142
Why are you here?

88
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:11,314
Hi! I'm Ha Jae Kyung. Are you Jan Di's friend?

89
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:14,983
I'm also a friend of Jan Di. It's nice to meet you.

90
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,040
Oh, so you work part time here? It must be fun.

91
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,650
I've always wanted to do something like that.

92
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,994
Then do it!

93
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:27,663
Since you are such a universally beautiful woman, you are welcome any time.

94
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:32,768
For now, I'll just borrow my two friends today.

95
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:34,136
Sorry?

96
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:38,540
Chen, don't think of following me and take care of the things here.

97
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,145
Jan Di, Ga Eul, you guys are going to go somewhere without me again, right?

98
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,951
Don't worry about the porridge restaurant and go.

00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:43,273
Gossip with my girlfriends and bad-mouth my boyfriend and get advice about dating.

No, I don't have any friends.

120
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:36,490
Since I was young, I traveled so much to places like India, Europe, Africa.

121
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,927
I didn't have time to make friends.

122
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:48,537
So, what kind of style does Joon Pyo like?

123
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,801
Ah, it's pretty.

124
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,940
Look at that.

125
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,620
Over there, let's take a look.

126
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,780
They look pretty.

127
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,430
Jan Di.

128
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:34,316
Girly style or boyish style?

129
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:38,038
Or does he prefer a cute style?

130
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:43,926
He's too busy worrying about his own style from head to toe.

131
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:47,329
He probably won't remember what you were wearing.

132
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,433
The more I learn about him, the more I like him.

133
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,569
I like the serious type.

134
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,405
Tell me more about him, Jan Di.

135
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:10,517
He is second to none when it comes to disdaining others and being arrogant.

136
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:15,163
He acts like a total know-it-all, but in reality, he's ignorant.

137
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,920
And...

138
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,950
If he likes something,

139
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,136
he ignores others' opinions and pushes his own,

140
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,007
just like a bulldozer.

141
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:41,701
He's really scary when he's angry, but, when he's being nice,

142
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,542
he's really sweet.

143
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,350
Ah, in any case, if you put childish, spoiled, whiny brat all together,

144
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,466
that about sums him up.

145
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:04,727
Jan Di, you really know Joon Pyo well.

146
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,666
I'm impressed. I have a favor to ask you.

147
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,200
What is it?

148
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,116
I really want to make a go of things with him.

149
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:18,441
Jan Di, from today on, can you be my dating coach?

150
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,398
I'm begging you.

151
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,831
That girl is an interesting character, isn't she?

152
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:49,207
That's true. She's second only to Geum Jan Di.

153
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,716
What's so funny?

154
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:54,981
Your fiancée. She's really funny.

155
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:56,647
Fiancée, who says she's my fiancée?

156
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:59,871
Why not? I'm in favor of it.

157
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:03,020
Compared to all the other rich and snobby girls, she's not so bad.

158
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,440
But, when did you guys get so intimate? I distinctly remember her saying she bit your ear.

159
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,195
Joon Pyo, isn't that your weak spot?

160
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:16,302
To be more exact, it's his sensitive spot.

161
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:18,902
Do you guys think this is funny?

162
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:20,704
Well?

163
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,617
And you call yourselves my friends.

164
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,211
Move aside.

165
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,990
Seriously, how will he handle it?

166
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,458
It sounds like Joon Pyo's stuck in a corner and can't do anything.

167
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,847
It's one thing that the engagement is a business deal, but if she actually has feelings for him...

168
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:47,934
And on top of that, it's the JK Group.

169
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:52,378
If we don't do something fast, it'll only be a matter of time before Joon Pyo walks down the aisle.

170
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,071
You guys can take care of it.

171
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,956
What?

172
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,006
F4's Don Juan and Casanova.

173
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,714
Use some of your legendary skills.

174
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,887
We can just go on by ourselves now.

175
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,320
I had a lot of fun today.

176
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,370
And from now on, you two are Ha Jae Kyung's best friends. Okay?

177
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,105
Huh?

178
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:31,100
Oh, and this.

179
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,728
This is Jan Di's.

180
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:36,145
And this is Ga Eul's.

181
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:37,809
What is this?

182
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,904
They're gifts to thank you for being my friends.

183
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:42,586
Good night!

184
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,231
That unnie seems a little strange.

185
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,101
A bit, eh?

186
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,177
In any case, she's not someone you can dislike easily.

187
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,421
Ah, it's cold.

188
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,258
You're back?

189
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,263
What's with everyone?

190
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:27,932
Is something wrong?

191
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:31,901
Is it true that Master Goo Joon Pyo got engaged?

192
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:34,804
How did you find that out?

193
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,010
[A joint marriage between Shinhwa Group and global investments group JK]

194
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,963
It's true.

195
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,225
Ah, what can we do about this?

196
00:15:55,225 --> 00:16:00,330
All this time we waited thinking "no news is good news", but...

197
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,360
What can we do for Jan Di?

198
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,930
What do you mean by "What can we do for Jan Di"?

199
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,074
As if I have anything to do with him.

200
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,509
Did someone die?

201
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,260
Why shouldn't you be concerned?

202
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,912
Until just last year, you were slated to be the daughter-in-law of the Shinhwa Group.

203
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:17,500
What do you mean this doesn't concern you?

204
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:21,817
Wait just a second.
We're really ruined.

205
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:24,955
I mean, where did this girl even come from?

206
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,892
This is just like the saying that the wheel that rolls in displaces the wheel that's in place.

207
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:30,740
Wait a second.

208
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,030
We should find out what her name is and what her family does.

209
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,453
Hello.

210
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,056
Hi.

211
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,680
There are all sorts of things in here.

212
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,010
Wow, these are nice!

213
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,965
My name is Ha Jae Kyung.

214
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,731
Jan Di and I decided to be friends.

215
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,405
Oh no, I'm her unnie.

216
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:16,980
Please, take good care of me.

217
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,009
Ha Jae Kyung.

218
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,498
Wow, even your name is pretty.

219
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:24,197
Your face is pretty too.

220
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:30,147
If you and Jan Di decided to become sisters, then we should just make you a part of the family. Shouldn't we, honey?

221
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:33,357
From now on, think of this as your home and come visit often.

222
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:35,592
Thank you!

223
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:40,663
Then, can I sleep over tonight?

224
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,039
Sorry?

225
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,248
Don't you get a feeling of a déjà vu from this situation?

226
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:02,386
Yeah, I kept thinking that too.

227
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:05,588
Jan Di, where's your room?

228
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,368
It seems just like a pajama party.

229
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:14,430
I always wanted to do something like this.

230
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,834
This room is really cozy.

231
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,771
Is it?

232
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,810
It's really fascinating.

233
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,476
It's really fascinating.
What is?

234
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:31,546
It feels like I was fated to meet Goo Joon Pyo and you in Macau.

235
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:36,953
You've known Joon Pyo since Macau?

236
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,658
I guess I must have liked him since the first time I saw him.

237
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,260
Engagement.

238
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,560
If it had been anybody else, I would've made a scene.

239
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:53,569
But from the moment I saw him, my heart started racing.

240
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,773
Jan Di, have you ever felt like that?

241
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,510
I mean, do you have anybody you like?

242
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,578
Like a first love?

243
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,820
So you do have one.

244
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,910
What kind of person is he?

245
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:24,040
He was a rather dull person.

246
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,769
A dull person?

247
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:35,811
The kind of person that made me feel dull by comparison.

248
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:38,714
He was that kind of person.

249
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:42,785
Oh, I get it. He must be someone you feel comfortable with, a really sweet person.

250
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,957
Goo Joon Pyo is just like wine.

251
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:49,493
Wine?

252
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:54,698
Wine has a great aroma. As soon as you drink it, your whole body just turns upside down.

253
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,433
That kind of exhilarating feeling.

254
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,607
Wait! You don't think he has a girl that he likes, does he?

255
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,413
It doesn't matter. I just need to make him like me.

256
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,380
It's been a really long time

257
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,420
since there's something that I really wanted to get with my own efforts.

258
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:06,102
What?

259
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:08,538
Do you have something to say?

260
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:10,640
Why aren't you swimming?

261
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,142
I quit.

262
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:13,944
Why would a swimmer quit swimming?

263
00:21:13,944 --> 00:21:15,812
None of your business.

264
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:18,081
Did you follow me just to ask that?

265
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:22,316
It's not in my nature to just let things go, since I have to uncover what needs to be uncovered.

266
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:23,854
What?

267
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:29,125
That engagement or whatever. It doesn't concern me.

268
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,495
It doesn't concern me either.

269
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:36,063
Goo Joon Pyo... You've gotten really friendly

270
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:40,236
explaining things like this to the stain you want to erase.

271
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:50,320
Over there.

272
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
Your fiancée is headed that way.

273
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:01,872
Why is that monkey showing up again?

274
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:18,150
Sunbae.

275
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,240
Could you give me a ride?

276
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:32,871
What a coincidence to see you both together like this!

277
00:22:32,871 --> 00:22:36,094
Jan Di and Joon Pyo, I guess you two are really close.

278
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,130
Oh. Who's this person?

279
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,660
This is Ji Hoo sunbae.

280
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,211
Why are you introducing my friend?

281
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:50,807
Hey, monkey! This is my friend, Yoon Ji Hoo.

282
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:56,650
Do you like him?

283
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,810
Looks like you know what good-looking is.

284
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,177
I get it.

285
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:04,820
What?

286
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,043
This person's the one, right?

287
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:08,540
What?

288
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,520
The guy Jan Di likes.

289
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,468
Oh, unni, no that's not... this person and I...

290
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:22,547
That's great, let's go hang out, the four of us. What do you think? It's a good idea, eh?

291
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:24,480
- No.
- We can't.

292
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,998
Eh? Why not?

293
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:31,615
Uh, I have to go someplace urgently, right now.

294
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:36,352
Unni, you two just go off and have fun.

295
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:40,556
Sunbae, let's hurry up and go.

296
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:57,574
What shall we do now?

297
00:23:57,574 --> 00:23:59,443
Do? Do what?

298
00:24:03,714 --> 00:24:05,782
Let's go together!

299
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:27,737
Are you working part-time here, too?

300
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:30,840
It's not a part-time job. I'm here to volunteer.

301
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:35,445
I just clean and help out here and there.

302
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:39,581
But when I'm here, I feel relaxed and I'm able to study.

303
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:41,284
It's fascinating.

304
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:42,416
What is?

305
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:45,621
How you can do everything so diligently.

306
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:51,025
I guess I'll go inside then. Bye.

307
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:56,700
Geum Jan Di!

308
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:00,803
I can clean pretty well, too.

309
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,675
Hello.

310
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:07,110
Hello!

311
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,483
Hi!

312
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:11,180
- Pretty girl, why are you only coming now?
- I had to go to school.

313
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,340
Hello.

314
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,217
- Just a minute.
- You must eat

315
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:17,788
- before.
- Hello!

316
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:20,510
Thank you.

317
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,190
Yes. On Sunday, be sure to come and eat here. Got that?

318
00:25:23,193 --> 00:25:24,528
Grandma, let me check your temperature.

319
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:27,430
Go. Be careful.

320
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,070
- Shall I put this here?
- Yes.

321
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,060
Here.

322
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,210
You wore something thin, right?

323
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,412
Ji Hoo! Ji Hoo!

324
00:25:57,794 --> 00:26:00,700
What? That old man's, I mean,

325
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,733
that doctor's grandson is Ji Hoo sunbae?

326
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:09,550
So, Ji Hoo sunbae is the grandson of former President Yoon?

327
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,900
So that grandpa is... former President Yoon Suk Young?

328
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,814
No way! How is it they've gone on this long without seeing each other?

329
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:20,784
Going on this long without seeing each other wasn't a choice. They couldn't see each other.

330
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:24,687
What's that supposed to mean? Come on, what's your relationship with that grandpa?

331
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:28,691
Jan Di, those two people, you have to help them.

332
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:30,893
Huh?

333
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:33,296
Welc...

334
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:35,098
Hello.

335
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:38,850
Ga Eul, some water.

336
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,570
Me too.

337
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:44,774
What's going on with you guys?

338
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:27,360
Queen Elizabeth liked this piece.

339
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,050
Do you like it too?

340
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,160
You're giving this to me?

341
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:47,136
Whether it be man or dish, we're always waiting for a woman to properly appreciate us.

342
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:52,541
Thank you. If i give this to my Leon as his water dish, he'll love it.

343
00:27:53,176 --> 00:27:54,043
Leon?

344
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:56,879
It's my pet lion's name.

345
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:01,050
Lion?

346
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:15,732
Hey, miss.

347
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:18,201
You've got a killer style.

348
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:21,770
Why don't you have a cup of tea with us? It's cold, don't you think?

349
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:29,085
Laughing? This lady has no fear.

350
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:30,747
Kids.

351
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:35,184
Stop it right now.

352
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:38,854
Who are you?

353
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:43,259
You shouldn't bother a pretty lady.

354
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,895
Stop fooling around and get lost. We had dibs on her first.

355
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:50,833
It's time for children to go home.

356
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:53,701
Go home. You'll get hurt.

357
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:57,806
It's gotten a little noisy. Sorry.

358
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,730
What's this?

359
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,240
What?

360
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,624
Miss, are you alright?

361
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:51,327
Thanks for helping me.

362
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,733
Those idiots!

363
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:02,639
If that had been all, it would have been all right.

364
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:04,174
There's still more?

365
00:30:04,174 --> 00:30:08,410
Don't even go there. That girl is a real monster!

366
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:19,680
♫ I want nobody nobody but you ♫

367
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,320
♫ I want nobody nobody but you ♫

368
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,290
♫ I don't want anyone else if it's not you ♫

369
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:32,390
♫ I want nobody nobody, nobody nobody ♫

370
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,880
♫ Run the horse, run the horse ♫

371
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,320
♫ Run the horse ♫

372
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,830
♫ Run the horse ♫

373
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:51,780
♫ Run the horse ♫

374
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:33,897
I've seen plenty of girls in my day, but that's the first time I've ever experienced that kind.

375
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:35,898
Then what are we going to do now?

376
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:38,535
That unnie, she's close with us too.

377
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:42,338
We have no other choice, but to resort to our last emergency measure.

378
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:44,573
Emergency measure?

379
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:49,278
We'll give up on the monkey girl, and worry about getting the two idiots back together.

380
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,281
The two idiots?

381
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,552
So that's why I'm saying.

382
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,458
Ga Eul, you're going to have to help us.

383
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,693
I was the one that killed them.

384
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:57,690
I was the one who turned him into an orphan.

385
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:03,249
It's all my fault.

386
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,040
Hello.

387
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,390
What?!

388
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,190
You and Yi Jung sunbae are doing what?

389
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:38,353
Date.

390
00:33:38,353 --> 00:33:40,090
No, you can't.

391
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,339
You can't, Ga Eul.

392
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:46,742
Why? Yi Jung sunbae's not a bad person.

393
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:48,230
Uh, that is...

394
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,159
He's not bad.

395
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,788
He's not a bad person, but,

396
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:58,144
that person is F4's biggest...

397
00:33:58,144 --> 00:33:59,747
Biggest?

398
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,928
In any case, Ga Eul!

399
00:34:01,928 --> 00:34:06,604
It would be a good idea to really think this over.

400
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:10,000
I don't know. He said he's picking me up early tomorrow.

401
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,597
So I'm going to bed early, though I don't know if I'll be able to sleep.

402
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:18,041
Good night, Jan Di. Bye.

403
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,344
Err... Ga Eul..

404
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:31,421
So Yi Jung??

405
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:34,090
So Yi Jung.

406
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,780
So Yi Jung?!?

407
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:59,340
Ji Hoo sunbae, answer your phone! Please!

408
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:04,835
The number you have called cannot answer...

409
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:21,300
Ga Eul, how are you?

410
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,330
No way, no way.

411
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,510
No way!

412

413
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,424
Yo! Geum Jan Di, what's up?

414
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:38,321
Sunbae, Goo Joon Pyo, where is Goo Joon Pyo?

415
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:46,204
Goo Joon Pyo!

416
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:59,592
- Ah, Sunbae!
- You asked where he was,
you didn't ask what he was doing.

417
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,610
What the hell's with you?

418
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:09,090
Goo Joon Pyo,

419
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,022
help me. There's big trouble!

420
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:14,536
- Big trouble?
- It's out of my control.

421
00:36:14,536 --> 00:36:17,202
I don't have any money or a car.

422
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:19,037
What if something happens?

423
00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:21,962
Something happens? What will happen?

424
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:26,303
What happens if they end up at a hotel?

425
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:27,990
Hotel?

426
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:33,176
Geum Jan Di, I know you've gotten a shock because of that Monkey, but...

427
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:35,411
Why are you doing things you don't usually do?

428
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:39,282
Yi Jung sunbae says he's going on a date with Ga Eul.

429
00:36:42,264 --> 00:36:47,200
Now that I think about it, Yi Jung did mention a girl he was stuck on.

430
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,293
I wonder how long Ga Eul will last?

431
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,940
Two days?

432
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,560
No, it may only take him one day to finish her off.

433
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,968
O... One day?

434
00:36:56,968 --> 00:37:01,790
Geum Jan Di, don't you know what Yi Jung's nickname is? "5 second Kill."

435
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,407
"5 second Kill?"

436
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:07,245
One. .

437
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:10,715
Two.

438
00:37:11,382 --> 00:37:12,883
Three.

439
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:16,953
Four.

440
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,425
Five

441
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:47,216
Ga Eul..

442
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,460
No way...

443
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,630
No way!!!

444
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:05,936
Has Yi Jung taken drugs??

445
00:38:05,936 --> 00:38:08,038
To date Ga Eul.

446
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:11,241
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Honestly speaking,

447
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:14,410
Ga Eul isn't Yi Jung's type.

448
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:20,316
Yi Jung never dates anyone unless their body is better than Lee Hyori and their face is better than Kim Tae Hee.

449
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:22,640
With Ga Eul?

450
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,722
Leave them in an empty room together for 3 nights and 4 days. See if anything happens.

451
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,492
No, he actually said

452
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:32,896
that something about Ga Eul was really cute.

453
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:35,700
See!

454
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,368
Now what are we going to do? What are we going to do?

455
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:40,804
So, what do you want me to do?

456
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:43,173
Come here.

457
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:45,808
Give me your ear.

458
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:51,660
I don't know.

459
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,510
Why?

460
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,740
Here's what...

461
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:03,593
Oh. He's here.

462
00:39:22,212 --> 00:39:24,981
Are you ready?

463
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,670
Yes.

464
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,380
You and I are both suffering because of our idiot friends.

465
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:36,826
Do you think we can pull it off without getting caught?

466
00:39:37,394 --> 00:39:41,831
Don't worry. Just follow my lead.

467
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:45,435
We've already done this acting thing together once before.

468
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,450
Get down!

469
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:04,153
Don't be nervous.

470
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:13,931
Start the car. Fast, fast! Start.

471
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:20,635

00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:16,519
I tried to live as though I didn't need anyone, but,

488
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,327
I keep wanting to hold on to everyone.

489
00:42:25,762 --> 00:42:27,564
What should I do?

490
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,830
Are you okay?

491
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,336
It's been hard, hasn't it?

492
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:50,222
No, it's been fun.

493
00:44:05,036 --> 00:44:07,984
Who wouldn't mistake him for a player?

494
00:44:07,984 --> 00:44:12,300
Yi Jung Sunbae is ridiculous.

495
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:18,323
So would you rather he didn't care whether she froze to death or not?

496
00:44:19,127 --> 00:44:22,348
Well, no, it's not that.

497
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:26,048
Look at your lips turning blue.

498
00:44:26,048 --> 00:44:29,339
You'd probably freeze before your friend.

499
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:34,278
Come here.

500
00:44:36,063 --> 00:44:39,158
- Hey, what are you doi...?
- Just stay still.

501
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:58,119
I'm o-okay.

502
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:11,393
Look. I told you this would work.

503
00:45:11,393 --> 00:45:13,617
Yeah.

504
00:45:13,617 --> 00:45:17,027
Then, should we slowly lead up to the climax?

505
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:37,477
Are you ready?

506
00:45:50,366 --> 00:45:57,521
How is it that you guys can make a fireworks display look as simple as setting off a kid's firecracker?

507
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:02,132
That rascal, he sure is cool.

508
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,504
Was it that cool when I did that?

509
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:14,211
But...

510
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:19,364
What was the last thing Yi Jung said?

511
00:46:21,493 --> 00:46:26,156
What do you mean? There's only one thing he could have said in that situation.

512
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:28,191
What's that?

513
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,608
Should we go up?

514
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:35,681
Go up where?

515
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:45,930
No way.

516
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,940
No way!

517
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:52,882
Though he's my friend, he sure is a real player.

518
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:55,813
How could he bring her to a hotel?

519
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,100
I was wondering why he took her skating.

520
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,629
Wow. I didn't know there was a deeper meaning behind it.

521
00:47:00,629 --> 00:47:03,792
Be quiet! I can't hear anything.

522
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:06,597
Do you know how many stars this hotel has? Do you really think you'll be able to hear anything?

523
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:07,661
Then what should I do?

524
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:10,814
Why don't you go outside and stand guard?!

525
00:47:10,814 --> 00:47:13,206
Oh, that's right.

526
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:25,516
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo!

527
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:27,150
What's wrong?

528
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,820
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

529
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,370
What-

530
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:42,098
Oh my god! Yi Jung Sunbae must have prepared that.

531
00:47:42,098 --> 00:47:44,683
Hey, do something!

532
00:47:44,683 --> 00:47:45,669
What?

533
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:48,380
That's the mark of a player,

534
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,454
we can't let that go in that room.

535
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:55,311
- Let's go bring that here.
- What?

536
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:58,250
Hurry! Hurry!

537
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,951
Ah, really!

538
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:11,361
Hurry! Go! I said go!

539
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:33,682
Thank you.

540
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:49,666
It's a complete success.

541
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:52,369
Will everything be all right?

542
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,639
I'm not sure. As a couple, they have so much going against them.

543
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,742
We've done all we could, so we'll just have to wait and see.

544
00:48:59,742 --> 00:49:02,579
You did great today, Ga Eul.

545
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:10,253
Oh, Woo Bin.

546
00:49:10,253 --> 00:49:13,390
We're about to finish up here.

547
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,059
Okay.

548
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:49,192
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

549
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:55,999
Though it's late, happy birthday.

550
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:58,590
Though it's late,

551
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,430
thanks for the present.

552
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:04,775
You got my gift?

553
00:50:04,775 --> 00:50:08,812
That was the first time I've ever received such a crappy gift.

554
00:50:08,812 --> 00:50:11,648
But I'll accept it because it's the thought that counts.

555
00:50:19,324 --> 00:50:21,659
Though it's late...

556
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:26,063
Congratulations on your engagement.

557
00:50:26,063 --> 00:50:28,431
I told you to stop thinking about that!

558
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,735
Jae Kyung Unnie is a good person.

559
00:50:31,735 --> 00:50:33,303
Unnie?

560
00:50:34,571 --> 00:50:37,708
She really,

561
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:42,812
really likes you a lot.

562
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:51,154
You're still as nosy as ever!

563
00:50:52,189 --> 00:50:54,057
That's right.

564
00:50:54,057 --> 00:50:57,527
If you didn't drive me crazy, then you wouldn't be Geum Jan Di.

565
00:51:00,296 --> 00:51:01,831
So...

566
00:51:03,032 --> 00:51:06,803
Would you be happy if I just gave up and got married tomorrow?

567
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:09,205
Would that make you feel better?

568
00:51:17,444 --> 00:51:20,717
What is that girl doing?

569
00:51:21,638 --> 00:51:24,621
I'm going to go out for a little bit.

570
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:27,624
This girl...

571
00:51:48,011 --> 00:51:49,112
Everything is going well, right?

572
00:51:49,112 --> 00:51:51,581
Yes, everything is going just fine.

573
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:55,518
By the way, Joon Pyo is currently in a hotel room.

574
00:51:56,919 --> 00:52:00,924
Joon Pyo's in the hotel right now?

575
00:52:00,924 --> 00:52:02,458
Yes.

576
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:13,737
What is this?

577
00:52:13,737 --> 00:52:16,439
Why can't I hear anything?

578
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,476
They can't be...

579
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:25,448
You there!

580
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,056
What are you doing here?

581
00:52:34,056 --> 00:52:36,759
H-Hello.

582
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:41,698
You really are a girl I can't let slide.

583
00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:46,703
Or are you finally showing your true colors?

584
00:52:50,606 --> 00:52:56,947
This is why I was careful from the start in preventing him from hanging around with kids from trashy families.

585
00:52:58,182 --> 00:53:01,785
Your words are a little harsh.

586
00:53:01,785 --> 00:53:06,289
My family is not trashy.

587
00:53:07,424 --> 00:53:12,963
If a still wet-behind-the-ears girl who follows a boy into a hotel, isn't trashy, then...

588
00:53:12,963 --> 00:53:14,864
Hey, Geum Jan Di! You!

589
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:28,909
Why? Did Joon Pyo's engagement make you nervous?

590
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:31,848
Is that why you thought you'd try to throw yourself at him?

591
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:35,420
- You rude, awful girl!
- Stop it!

592
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:44,124
Please. Stop.

593
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,750

661
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:12,149
Yeah, mom?

662
01:01:13,181 --> 01:01:14,849
What's wrong?

663
01:01:16,795 --> 01:01:18,788
Mom!

664
01:01:18,788 --> 01:01:21,375
Was there some kind of accident?

665
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:24,647
Mom! Mom!

666
01:01:27,861 --> 01:01:29,829
What's happening?

667
01:02:00,727 --> 01:02:02,863
Honey.

668
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:07,969
Look at that.

669
01:02:07,969 --> 01:02:11,247
If you have any eyes, just look.

670
01:02:11,247 --> 01:02:14,676
What are we going to do from now on?

671
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:18,913
It's hard enough paying the interest with what we're making now.

672
01:02:18,913 --> 01:02:23,054
How could you think about vouching for someone's debt?

673
01:02:23,054 --> 01:02:28,835
That is... Long before our situation became like this, a friend asked to just borrow my name.

674
01:02:28,835 --> 01:02:30,225
Just your name?

675
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:34,063
With just your name, how could these red tags...
 (Repossessions)

676
01:02:34,063 --> 01:02:35,963
Oh honey!

677
01:02:35,963 --> 01:02:39,432
Oh, headache! Headache!

678
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:44,171
Hello?

679
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:51,620
Yes, this is Mr. Geum Il Bong and Mrs. Na Gong Ju's residence.

680
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,962
The Art Center?

681
01:03:01,355 --> 01:03:07,427
I'm sorry, but my parents have been ill lately.

682
01:03:08,996 --> 01:03:13,133
Could I do it in their place?

683
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:18,539
What I'm saying is that it puts me in a tight spot if they don't come back to work soon.

684
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:20,340
I'm sorry.

685
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:24,044
I'll do everything that has been delayed so far.

686
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:29,650
Can you please give them some time until they recover?

687
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:33,489
I'm letting this go because even though you're young, you're so earnest.

688
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:37,819
Then, I'm entrusting this with you.

689
01:03:37,819 --> 01:03:40,219
Thank you.

690
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:44,063
Thank you!
