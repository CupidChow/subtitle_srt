♫ Warmer even than the sun ♫

♫ The way you look at me ♫

[Boys Over Flowers]

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,774
I was thinking about how I could lure Goo Joon Pyo.

7
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,952
I saw this as an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.

8
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:31,303
Who put you up to this?

9
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:32,666
Why?

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,356
It's kind of funny, isn't it?

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,510
Joon Pyo is all fussy after losing his girl,

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,855
and imagine his shock finding out it was his mother who paid for the whole thing.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,830
His mom?

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,041
You mean, the person who put you up to this is Goo Joon Pyo's mother?

15
00:00:55,041 --> 00:01:01,135
If Sunbae had just gone along with it, I would have given you half of the money.

16
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:03,685
You should've been wiser.

17
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:04,989
What do you mean?

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,332
The moment you rejected my proposal,

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,381
the goal of the game became just one thing: Goo Joon Pyo.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,355
Why are you doing this to Goo Joon Pyo?

21
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:16,952
Why?

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,327
Everyone here,

23
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:24,623
must have at least a few reasons for wanting revenge on Goo Joon Pyo.

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,402
You want to hear them all?

25
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,386
Tell me the truth.

26
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:31,351
Why you are doing this to Goo Joon Pyo,

27
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,641
and what wrong has Goo Joon Pyo ever done to you?

28
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:35,773
Tell me.

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,621
To be exact,

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,540
he wronged my older brother.

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,549
Your brother?

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,340
Do you remember?

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,073
To my sweet brother

34
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:02,849
who was warmer to his despised half-brother than his own father.

35
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,404
Jan Di Sunbae.

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,387
Look at me closely.

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,627
Don't I...

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,934
remind you of someone?

39
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,542
This is not a school.

40
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,197
It's hell.

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,430
No!!

42
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,981
No.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,930
Do you mean

44
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,674
the person from the rooftop?

45
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:45,412
Bingo.

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,364
I will say hello to my brother for you.

47
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,410
He almost died.

48
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,150
But he always smiles when he talks about you.

49
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,399
You!

50
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,370
That's right.

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,180
I wanted revenge.

52
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,973
But...

53
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,310
As I got closer to you,

54
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,358
if you chose to be with me, revenge wouldn't matter anymore.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,850
I thought that.

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,176
I truly thought that, but...

57
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,593
Hurry and go in!

58
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:37,706
Jan Di! Geum Jan Di, are you okay?

59
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:39,774
Quiet!

60
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,476
Goo Joon Pyo!

61
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,586
Geum Jan Di! Are you okay?

62
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:54,088
You're not hurt, right?

63
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:56,556
Goo Joon Pyo! Why did you come?

64
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:58,427
What is it that you thought you could accomplish?

65
00:03:58,427 --> 00:03:59,594
Did you make sure?

66
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,329
Yeah, he definitely came alone.

67
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,366
Stupid bastard. Today's your unlucky day.

68
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:06,868
Let the girl go first.

69
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:10,437
It seems you plan on acting cool to the very end.

70
00:04:10,437 --> 00:04:12,573
That won't do.

71
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:15,977
I'll make sure you're beaten to a bloody pulp. You won't be able to move even a finger.

72
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:20,615
We must make sure your princess sees you in such a sorry state.

73
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,383
Don't you think so?

74
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,819
You guys can begin.

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,500
Ouch!

76
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,961
Goo Joon Pyo!

77
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,763
Goo Joon Pyo...

78
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,133
Goo Joon Pyo!

79
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,470
Stop!

80
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,381
Stop it!

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,608
Ah! Goo Joon Pyo!

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,446
Don't do this! Stop!

83
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:54,649
Please save him! Please save him!

84
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:58,353
Goo Joon Pyo!

85
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:00,154
Stop.

86
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,001
Does it hurt?

87
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,407
Now, beg me to save your life.

88
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,177
Get on your knees and beg.

89
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:25,780
Then I'll let the girl go.

90
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,855
No! Goo Joon Pyo!

91
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:37,890
Don't! Don't do it!

92
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,480
Goo Joon Pyo.

93
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,950
Stop!!!

94
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,136
Now say you'll give up Jan Di.

95
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,940
Hurry up and say it!

96
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,112
I don't think I can do that.

97
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,881
What?

98
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:36,216
Are you deaf?

99
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,820
I said I can't do that.

100
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,721
Do you want to die?

101
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:43,780
I don't want to die,

102
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,450
but if you're going to kill me, I have no choice.

103
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,964
Say it!

104
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,535
Hurry up and say it!

105
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,751
Geum Jan Di.

106
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,050
Wake up.

107
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,990
Jan Di.

108
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,196
Geum Jan Di.

109
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,066
- Jan Di!
- Goo Joon Pyo!

110
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:28,067
- Geum Jan Di!
- Goo Joon Pyo!

111
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,838
Go check outside.

112
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,110
Are you guys okay?

113
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,740
Geum Jan Di.

114
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,720
Geum Jan Di.

115
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,136
Geum Jan Di.

116
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:37,971
Are you conscious?

117
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,681
Goo Joon Pyo...

118
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:48,383
Hey, stupid.

119
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,784
I thought I was going to die of shock because of you!

120
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:52,754
Isn't that what I should be saying?

121
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:54,789
Aren't you the stupid one?

122
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:56,850
Why did you just let them hit you like that?

123
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,928
Didn't you say you could beat up anyone even if it was 10 to one?

124
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:03,830
You are a complete braggart.

125
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,703
You stupid, idiot, with an IQ of two digits. You're so slow witted.

126
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:09,804
What?

127
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:12,373
They had you tied up, what was I supposed to do?

128
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,981
I'd rather get the crap kicked out of me than watch them hurt even a finger on your body.

129
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,251
But...

130
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,100
Because of that I was getting beaten to death on purpose,

131
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,820
so why did you interfere?

132
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:31,359
What if something really bad happened?

133
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,929
It doesn't matter what the situation is, you always act so nosy.

134
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,704
You stupid, idiot, with an IQ of two digits. You're so slow witted.

135
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,539
- What?
- Hey!

136
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,044
Do you always hit patients?

137
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:53,047
Do you always hit women?

138
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:56,150
- I'm really hurt.
- I'm really hurt too.

139
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,953
How can you say that with that look on your face?

140
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:01,656
You always...

141
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:04,558
Who do you think you're hitting?!

142
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,961
I'm home.

143
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,090
My god, what should we do?

144
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,977
What is it?

145
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,482
What happened?

146
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:30,384
What is all of this?

147
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:35,522
Hey, Kang San, don't cry and tell me. What happened?

148
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:40,327
Father has been taken by the loan shark.

149
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,373
What?

150
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:46,137
Jan Di. What should we do?

151
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:48,495
What will happen if they kill your father?

152
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:54,519
They say if we can't pay them back, they'll sell everything whether it's a liver or a kidney.

153
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,050
What are we going to do if they kill your father?

154
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,450
What should your father do?

155
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,965
Oh, how are we supposed to survive.

156
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,275
For what did you come?

157
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:21,779
Ah, yes. I came to see the President.

158
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,016
Please come this way.

159
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,997
President.

160
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,474
Is there something wrong?

161
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,543
Help me.

162
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,412
What are you talking about?

163
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,214
The offer you presented us with last time.

164
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,610
Wait, no, even half of half of your previous offer is good.

165
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,120
Please, save my family.

166
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,361
No matter how much I think this through, the only person I can think of who can help us is you.

167
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,563
So even though it may be considered inappropriate and difficult, I came to see you.

168
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,566
Well it doesn't seem like it is too difficult for me.

169
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,938
But there is an order to everything.

170
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,406
Order?

171
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:24,012
If you commit a wrong, an apology should be first.

172
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:27,996
Whatever needs to be repaid should be repaid. Whoever needs help then should be helped.

173
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,787
Because I am a business woman, I hate anything that is calculated incorrectly or out of order.

174
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,992
Ah, yes of course that is how it should be.

175
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,180
Last time I committed a deadly sin.

176
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,970
Not knowing my station in life I dared to insult you. I sincerely apologize.

177
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,540
Please forgive me.

178
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,002
You shouldn't do that.

179
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:28,906
Please, forgive me.

180
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,160
I was the one who did wrong, please forgive me.

181
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,150
Please forgive me.

182
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,788
Save my family, please forgive me.

183
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,966
Thank you.

184
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,368
Thank you.

185
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,313
I'm home.

186
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,449
Dad!!!

187
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:47,986
Oh, my Jan Di.

188
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:50,355
Are you okay? Nothing's wrong right?

189
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,158
Of course! I'm okay.

190
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,380
That's good.

191
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,960
Do you know how much I was worried about you?

192
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,730
What's wrong with everyone?

193
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,970
Dad came home... Did something happen?

194
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,390
That... could that be...

195
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,726
It's not "could that be," it's definitely it.

196
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,860
- Mom!
- What did you want me to do?

197
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,180
Did you want me to let your father die?

198
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,760
All this money here, where else would it be from?

199
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,138
That money, go return it!

200
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,339
- What..?
- Go Return it now!

201
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,608
No, I can't!

202
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,850
Do you know what I did to get this?

203
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,180
And if I return it, how are you gonna face the music?

204
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:54,119
I'll do it. It's what I did so I will face the music.

205
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,355
I'll use whatever means possible to repay them.

206
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,227
Jan Di, take the money, and return it.

207
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:00,993
What are you going to do? How?!

208
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,362
Just take it back!

209
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,120
If you don't, then... you better watch out!

210
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,560
Do whatever you want!

211
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,540
It's cold.

212
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,564
You didn't even wear a jacket.

213
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,933
Here.

214
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,069
Hurry.

215
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,978
Jan Di...

216
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:55,446
Yes?

217
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:57,200
You...

218
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,618
really like Joon Pyo right?

219
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,194
Answer me.

220
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,600
To me, you're more important.

221
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,573
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,670
To my daughter's beautiful love,

223
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:33,350
I'm only a burden.

224
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,960
Love, who said I loved him?

225
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,990
Dad...

226
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,092
It is love.

227
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,596
That's love, Jan Di.

228
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:55,539
He means to you as much as you compare with your dad.

229
00:17:55,539 --> 00:18:00,177
I'm not even sure, so how would you know?

230
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,216
I've been your father for 19 years and you think I wouldn't know that?

231
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,850
Dad!

232
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,238
President.

233
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,574
Geum Jan Di is here to see you.

234
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,378
Really?

235
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,689
Come in, what's your business here?

236
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,028
I came here to return the money.

237
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:05,320
I heard that your family is going through a tough time.

238
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,740
Wouldn't it be wiser that you pocket your useless pride?

239
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,570
It's not pride, but the conclusion my family came to.

240
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,456
Please excuse me for everything that happened.

241
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,295
If it wasn't enough, I can give you more.

242
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:27,932
I've been watching you and I think you're pretty good at making deals.

243
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:30,868
Fine, let's make a deal.

244
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,450
Please do not insult me and my family anymore.

245
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,710
I beg you.

246
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,114
What?

247
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:47,019
So, are you really thinking of going out with my Joon Pyo?

248
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:53,390
That's a problem between me and Joon Pyo.

249
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,400
Fine,

250
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,470
but let's be serious now.

251
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:12,944
I admit that I made things tough for your family.

252
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:20,351
Please accept the fact that you and Joon Pyo are not meant to be together.

253
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,287
Okay.

254
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,420
Joon Pyo and I are very different.

255
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,760
I understand that.

256
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,432
But, you know,

257
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,806
we're surrounded by the same things and standing in the same place.

258
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,960
I made a promise with Goo Joon Pyo.

259
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,350
That we wouldn't use you as an excuse to break up.

260
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:06,250
This money was given to your family because your mother kneeled before me and begged.

261
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:12,000
Are you going to throw it all away just because of your childish pride?

262
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,997
Pride aside, this is an amazing offer.

263
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:20,190
Are you sure you won't regret this?

264
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,016
I didn't know you could put a price on pride.

265
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:30,412
Then, how much is your pride?

266
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:33,083
You are too spunky.

267
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:37,600
It'd be great if you could change your opinion on the notion

268
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,910
that a commoner's pride can be sold.

269
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:44,930
And, a person's heart is not something you can buy with money.

270
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:48,830
You didn't know that, did you?

271
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:51,550
But,

272
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,337
now Goo Joon Pyo knows it.

273
00:21:58,473 --> 00:22:00,108
I have to go.

274
00:22:37,744 --> 00:22:39,715
It's kind of funny, isn't it?

275
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:44,210
Goo Joon Pyo is all fussy after losing his girl and imagine his shock finding out

276
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,600
it was his mother who paid for the whole thing.

277
00:22:55,697 --> 00:22:57,899
You called 119 didn't you?

278
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:05,707
I came to put out the fire.

279
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,180
♫ Because I'm stupid ♫

280
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,480
♫ I know no one but you ♫

281
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,700
♫ But you are looking at someone else ♫

282
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,050
♫ You wouldn't know how I feel ♫

283
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,830
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

284
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,710
It's a pancake.

285
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:43,850
You need to mix flour, milk, and, of course, baking powder.

286
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,040
Just like bindaedduk.

287
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,880
♫ My tears keep rolling ♫

288
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,960
♫ Your backside ♫

289
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,130
♫ Looking at that is also a happiness ♫

290
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,070
♫ If you still don't know... ♫

291
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,380
This is the best cure when you're on the verge of crying.

292
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,040
♫ If I stop this and go too ♫

293
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,350
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

294
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,570
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

295
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,900
♫ "I love you" plays on my mouth ♫

296
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,500
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

297
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,401
Thank you. It was delicious.

298
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:41,370
Then, should we get going?

299
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,540
To where?

300
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,410
♫ Yes yes yo ♫

301
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,030
♫ Yes yes yo ♫

302
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,980
♫ My heart goes bang bang boom when I see you ♫

303
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,600
♫ I stay up all night because of the excitement ♫

304
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,630
♫ I style myself up moderately oh yeah ♫

305
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,100
♫ My scooter which is shinier ♫

306
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,350
♫ This road also welcomes you, way ♫

307
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,990
♫ The sun shines over us ♫

308
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,920
♫ I want to confess now ♫

309
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,160
♫ I gather up my courage and say ♫

310
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,682
Hey, straighten your legs.

311
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:30,351
Yeah, like that.

312
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:33,353
Hey! You idiot!

313
00:25:33,353 --> 00:25:35,180
Buzz off!

314
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,870
♫ I want to have only you ♫

315
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,580
♫ Get up, stand up, my heart goes bang bang boom when I see you ♫

316
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,500
♫ Oh, let it be, excuse me my baby ♫

317
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,850
♫ Lady who captivates me in a second ♫

318
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,660
♫ My heart's like a dynamite that'll burst ♫

319
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,100
♫ Yes yes yo oh ♫

320
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,310
Ah, you idiot!

321
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:59,720
F4 ! It is F4!

322
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,820
Isn't that Geum Jan Di?

323
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:08,810
Let's... hurry and tell Ginger!

324
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:16,230
What is that?

325
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:18,600
Nothing, it's nothing.

326
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,250
What do you mean nothing?

327
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:26,808
Just looking at this, it feels like a proposal is coming.

328
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:28,230
What proposal?

329
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,410
She keeps getting into trouble, so I thought I'd give her a leash.

330
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,583
Is Geum Jan Di your pet?

331
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:39,317
With your personality, giving this to Jan Di worries me.

332
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:43,160
Geum Jan Di's not the type to quietly accept something like a leash.

333
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,601
I think you'll get beat up again.

334
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:49,420
Jan Di's lethal spin kick?

335
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,360
I think I might want to see that.

336
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,905
Why are you guys making such a fuss? So annoying.

337
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,203
Pay up.

338
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:08,943
I came to turn pages in your music book... but you don't have one.

339
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:12,847
Instead, would you like to run an errand for me?

340
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:24,525
Hey, Yoon Ji Hoo. How can you call me out here just to leave me out in the cold?

341
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:28,196
Goo Joon Pyo?

342
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:30,130
Geum Jan Di.

343
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,281
Here.

344
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:07,860
It's cold. Wear this.

345
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,348
You, put your hands deep in here and stay still.

346
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,487
There's something in here.

347
00:29:30,325 --> 00:29:32,310
What is this?

348
00:29:32,995 --> 00:29:36,430
Can't you tell just by looking at it? It's a necklace.

349
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,280
Hey, this can't be right.

350
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,020
I know your style is a bit strange, but this is a girl's necklace!

351
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,043
Idiot.

352
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,381
It's for you.

353
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:54,990
What?

354
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,060
I said it's for you.

355
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,080
There's only one of these in the entire world,

356
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,960
so if you lose it this time, you're really dead.

357
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:09,331
Only one?

358
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,799
Yes.

359
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,769
There's really only one?

360
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,674
I designed it myself and had it made.

361
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,143
Look here.

362
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,549
This is me, and the one inside is you.

363
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,852
How?

364
00:30:31,852 --> 00:30:35,723
How is it that you're the star and I'm the moon?

365
00:30:35,723 --> 00:30:38,000
Because the moon, Geum Jan Di,

366
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,520
can never leave the star, Goo Joon Pyo.

367
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,560
No matter what happens,

368
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,410
I'll never let go of this moon.

369
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:59,700
♫ Love U, if I could fill your two eyes ♫

370
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:05,720
♫ Love U, if you show me your smile ♫

371
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,540
♫ Even the starlight there ♫

372
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:15,740
See, you catch colds when you do things you don't usually do.

373
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,966
I didn't catch a cold, I just coughed, okay?

374
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,500
♫ Love U, if you teach me how that feels ♫

375
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,730
♫ I'll follow all of that ♫

376
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,770
♫ Love U Love U Love U ♫

377
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,200
It's cold. Come here.

378
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,410
Look over there.

379
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,000
That star is so bright.

380
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,707
Are you sure? Isn't that a satellite?

381
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,900
It's pretty. It really is the only one of its kind.

382
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,530
Don't you think it's romantic?

383
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,690
What do you mean romantic?

384
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,100
Whenever I hear that, I feel so burdensome.

385
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,120
I'm already afraid of what will happen if I lose it.

386
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,730
You seem pretty happy to me.

387
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,260
What?

388
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,210
I think it'd be so nice if someone made and gave me a one-of-a-kind keepsake,

389
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,960
even if it is just a piece of glass.

390
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,856
- Let's go!
- Where?

391
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:51,825
Where else? Skiing.

392
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:53,338
Let's go.

393
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,048
Oh... My... God...

394
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:02,050
What did she just say?

395
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,470
A one-of-a-kind necklace?

396
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,208
She got it from Joon Pyo!

397
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:10,475
Stay calm. I just can't stay calm for something like this!

398
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:15,551
You guys... do you think she has the right to get something like that?

399
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:17,318
No!

400
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:20,154
It's not because it wasn't me that I'm saying this.

401
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:22,524
Geum Jan Di is just so unacceptable, isn't she?

402
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:24,391
Yes!

403
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:27,963
You guys, let's go.

404
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:35,569
Geum Jan Di, you're dead.

405
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:38,306
Ouch! My belly hurts.

406
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,950
♫ Almost paradise ♫

407
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,800
♫ Warmer even than the sun ♫

408
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,560
♫ The way you look at me ♫

409
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,650
♫ Feels like I have the whole world ♫

410
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:04,300
♫ In my life, in my tiring life, you came to me like a light ♫

411
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:11,650
♫ If I could treasure your love forever ♫

412
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,730
♫ You are all of my love ♫

413
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,612
Jan Di, are you okay?

414
00:34:17,612 --> 00:34:19,320
You go on ahead!

415
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,710
♫ I bet my everything and love you ♫

416
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:33,920
♫ If I could love you forever ♫

417
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,129
Oh... Geum Jan Di.

418
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:40,001
I didn't know it was you.

419
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,170
Sorry!

420
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,830
It's ok.

421
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,904
Are you okay?

422
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,980
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- You should be careful.

423
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,460
Oh.

424
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,610
Are you alright?

425
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,640
- You should be more careful.
- Uh, oh.

426
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:58,153
Be careful!

427
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:01,456
Are you okay? You should be careful.

428
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:04,240
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Okay, get up.

429
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,060
Jan Di, get up.

430
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,034
- Are you ok?
- Huh, I'm fine.

431
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,420
It's ok, go.

432
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,940
See you!

433
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,512
Jan Di! Are you ok?

434
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,747
Yeah, I'm fine!

435
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,882
And you, are you ok?

436
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,842
Ga Eul! Ga Eul be careful!

437
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,648
Ga Eul, are you ok?

438
00:36:00,648 --> 00:36:03,584
Wake up! Can you hear me?

439
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,455
Ga Eul!

440
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,223
Ga Eul.

441
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,693
Are you ok?

442
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,135
Yeah, honey, about that...

443
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,639
Okay, I'll take responsibility.

444
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,908
So you shouldn't say anything.

445
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:31,110
The important thing right now is neither you nor me.

446
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,449
How can you just throw away Shinhwa like that?

447
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:36,410
You know how your father...

448
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,820
Honey! Honey?

449
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,262
President.

450
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,266
Our condition isn't good.

451
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,780
Joon Pyo...

452
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,870
Find Joon Pyo first.

453
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:00,508
I need him so we can hurry and leave.

454
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:02,143
I understand.

455
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,221
Here, try this chocolate.

456
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,729
Jan Di, where's your necklace?

457
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:24,031
Necklace? It's here...

458
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,435
My necklace!

459
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,774
But, where is it?

460
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,185
What do you guys want?

461
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:48,590
Did you by any chance give Jan Di a necklace?

462
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,924
How did you guys know that?

463
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:53,370
Doesn't it have a moon inside a star?

464
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,990
I'm asking you how you know that!

465
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,770
You should ask Jan Di if she still has it.

466
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,630
What?

467
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:05,639
Whether she dropped it or threw it away, she may have lost it on the mountain.

468
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:11,611
How could she lose something so important so easily?

469
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:17,560
One thing about a person can say a lot about the rest of her. She thinks nothing of Sunbae...

470
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,591
Yes! You're dead now.

471
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,028
Did you lose something?

472
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,205
I was just cleaning the room.

473
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:15,680
The necklace, why aren't you wearing it?

474
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,745
The necklace, it's...

475
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,816
Goo Joon Pyo, I did something wrong!

476
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:26,510
I was wearing your necklace, but I don't know when it disappeared.

477
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,520
I really don't know.

478
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,027
It's not because you wanted to lose it?

479
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,496
Huh?

480
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,200
You're always like this.

481
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:45,070
If you truly knew my heart, you wouldn't step all over it.

482
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,043
Am I really that insignificant to you?

483
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,315
Goo Joon Pyo, don't misunderstand.

484
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:56,860
It's really not like that.

485
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:02,250
You really make it difficult for a person.

486
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:01,110
Blockhead!

487
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:04,090
Idiot!

488
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:08,050
Fool!

489
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:18,160
Hey, Geum Jan Di, do you even know how much that necklace is worth?

490
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,460
I told you there's only one.

491
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:23,860
What is this?

492
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,640
The president asked us to come get you.

493
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:28,530
Please hurry.

494
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,245
I don't want to.

495
00:41:31,245 --> 00:41:32,952
Young master, the President said...

496
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:36,250
Like I said, I don't care what that witch said. I'm still not going.

497
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,110
Tell her that.

498
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:44,130
Let go.

499
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,190
- Aren't you going to let go?
- We're sorry.

500
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:56,520
- Young master, the President...
- I said, I'm not going!

501
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:04,745
I'm not going.

502
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:15,540
Let's go...

503
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,190
Let go!

504
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:30,000
Due to a fierce blizzard in Kangwon Province, all traffic has come to a halt.

505
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,040
Due to a fierce blizzard in Kangwon Province, all traffic has come to a halt.

506
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:42,550
There's a big problem...

507
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,860
Ga Eul, what's wrong?

508
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,480
Jan Di... Jan Di, at the mountain...

509
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,477
I'm going to find the necklace. I'll be right back.

510
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:56,812
Necklace?

511
00:42:56,812 --> 00:42:58,914
Where's Joon Pyo now?

512
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,400
I'm cramped.

513
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,170
Yeah?

514
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:18,501
Yeah, something annoying came up.

515
00:43:20,677 --> 00:43:22,170
What?

516
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:30,240
Find a bathroom.

517
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:55,337
Geum Jan Di!

518
00:43:55,337 --> 00:43:58,908
Did you by any chance lose your star necklace?

519
00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:00,180
How did you know?

520
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:05,280
So... it was yours.

521
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,450
Should we tell you where you can find it?

522
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,472
Someone posted a memo that they found a necklace at the top of the mountain,

523
00:44:12,472 --> 00:44:15,250
and left it at the hilltop cafe for safe keeping. Go see...

524
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,487
Go see...

525
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,026
Really?

526
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:21,700
Where do I need to go? This way?

527
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,970
Thanks!

The weather outside keeps getting worse.

538
00:45:23,879 --> 00:45:28,160
Something bad won't really happen to her, right?

539
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,260
What do you mean? Nothing's going to happen.

540
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,760
She brought that on herself.

541
00:45:34,662 --> 00:45:36,810
She's a humble commoner.

542
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,730
How dare she take Joon Pyo Sunbae's one-of-a-kind token?

543
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,030
You're right.

544
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:47,462
If that commoner knew her place, we wouldn't have to go to such lengths.

545
00:45:47,462 --> 00:45:49,620
Such lengths? For what?

546
00:45:50,317 --> 00:45:52,754
Ji Hoo sunbae!

547
00:45:59,504 --> 00:46:02,620
What did you guys do to Jan Di?

[Male toilet]

549
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,647
Are you going to follow me into the bathroom?

550
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:44,670
He's taking too long, don't you think?

551
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:04,259
Jan Di said she wanted to find the necklace and went up the mountain alone.

552
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:06,130
Goo Joon Pyo, can you hear me?

553
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:09,650
I think Geum Jan Di may have been duped.

554
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:25,400

♫ The breeze that brushed off you ♫

557

♫ Is passing by me now ♫

♫ In my heart ♫

559

♫ Perhaps there's only the sunlight that shines you ♫

560
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:01,070
There's only one of these in the world, so if you lose it this time, you're really dead.

561
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:03,830
Only one?

562
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,780
This is me and the one in the middle is you.

563
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:11,125
How?

564
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:14,962
How is it that you're the star and I'm the moon?

565
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:17,170
Because Geum Jan Di,

566
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:22,990
the moon, can never leave Goo Joon Pyo, the star.

That's right, it's me, Goo Joon Pyo.

Are you okay now?

587
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:06,200
I came to find your heart.

588
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,440
I didn't lose it on purpose.

589
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,660
Hey, idiot. Who told you to do that?

590
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,985
Do you think you can get up?

591
00:50:19,588 --> 00:50:21,223
Get on my back.

592
00:50:31,399 --> 00:50:35,103
Jan Di, can you hear me?

593
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:37,638
Hey, you can't let yourself fade out!

594
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,541
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

595
00:50:56,257 --> 00:50:59,394
Because of the blizzard, they said it'd be hard to find her.

596
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:07,390
Ji Hoo, where are you going?

597
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,930
I can't just leave her out there like this.

598
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,838
- Are you going to cause even more trouble?
- They can't even send out a search party.

599
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:13,675
Geum Jan Di...

600
00:51:15,044 --> 00:51:17,178
Jan Di is out there.

601
00:51:17,178 --> 00:51:19,714
She's out there in the snow by herself.

602
00:51:19,714 --> 00:51:21,782
- Let me go.
- Ji Hoo...

603
00:51:21,782 --> 00:51:23,685
Calm down.

604
00:51:46,408 --> 00:51:49,977
Jan Di, are you ok?

605
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:51,947
Geum Jan Di?

606
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,262
Jan Di, are you okay?

607
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:11,032
Geum Jan Di? Geum Jan Di?

608
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:27,860
What are you doing?

609
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,410
You need to take these off.

610
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,487
Is it dirty?

611
00:52:31,487 --> 00:52:33,240
Take it all off.

612
00:52:33,788 --> 00:52:36,491
- Joon Pyo.
- Otherwise, you'll die.

613
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:39,260
Do you really want to freeze to death out of sheer stubborness?

614
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:42,340
It won't matter even if you resist.

615
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,790
I'm not going to let you just die like this.

616
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,620
Don't worry. It's ok.

617
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,600
It's going to be ok.

618
00:52:54,407 --> 00:52:56,541
I'll protect you.

619
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:33,619
Hurry.

620
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:52,320
I'm sorry.

621
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,790
If you know you're sorry, that's enough.

622
00:53:55,753 --> 00:54:00,040
Don't forget that I saved your life this time.

623
00:54:03,025 --> 00:54:05,820
How can I pay you back?

624
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,500
Lunch box.

625
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,448
You know, that stuff you eat every day.

626
00:54:14,562 --> 00:54:16,921
Fried egg? (Rolled up like an omelette log)

627
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,680
Yeah, that.

628
00:54:22,702 --> 00:54:24,620
To be honest...

629
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,600
I wanted to try it the first time I saw you eating it.

630
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:36,140
Why are you laughing?

631
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:42,213
I'm wondering if this is the same Goo Joon Pyo that I know.

632
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:45,349
Are you making fun of me right now?

633
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,758
I'll make it for you.

634
00:54:57,528 --> 00:55:01,360
Let's pack a lunch and go on a picnic.

635
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,360
Just the two of us.

638
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,090
Are you guys okay?

639

♫ Permit me now (Permit me now) ♫

659
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:23,470
♫ For me to gather my courage and confess to you ♫

660
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:28,620
♫ If you feel the same as me ♫

661
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:33,660
♫ If you want this too ♫

662
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,460
♫ Come to me ♫

[Shinhwa Group Chairman Gu Bon Hyung in Critical Condition]

666
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:09,390
The attorney general's office has opened an investigation on Shinhwa-gate,

667
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:13,810
and word has it that Beijing-based Chairman Goo is in serious condition.

668
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:17,761
According to an official spokesperson from Shinhwa Group,

669
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:23,812
Chairman Goo collapsed from shock and was taken to a hospital in Beijing.

670
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:30,233
Hello?

671
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:37,450
Sunbae!

672
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,645
- Hurry and get on!
- Why? What's going on?

673
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:42,390
It's urgent.

674
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:46,650
- What?
- We have to hurry if you want to see Joon Pyo.

675
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:51,188
Sunbae.

676
01:00:08,217 --> 01:00:10,324
Everything is ready.

677
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:14,130
President...

678
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,200
Joon Pyo's dad... collapsed.

679
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,240
What?

680
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,934
The plane is leaving in 30 minutes.

681
01:01:25,614 --> 01:01:30,420
I... didn't even get to say thank you or goodbye.

682
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:35,692
I didn't even get to tell him how I felt about him.

683
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:16,260
I'll return no matter what.

684
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,530
Just stay there and wait for me.

685
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:23,850
I love you, Geum Jan Di.

686
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:58,730
♫ I am walking, following you ♫

687
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:03,090
♫ I hide behind the moonlight there ♫

688
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:11,770
♫ What to do if you are so tactless? ♫

689
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:14,480
♫ For the rain to at least fall ♫

690
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,030
How could you eat that?!

691
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:19,910
Two knives.

692
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,820
Calm down! Do it slowly...

693
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,190
Calm down!

694
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:29,900
We didn't do anything.

695
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,980
Why are you making such sounds?

696
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,980
Oh, sorry.

697
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:45,260
Why are you laughing?

698
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,440
You did it on purpose, right?

699
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,520
I can't get a grip... Sorry.

700
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,910
I can't get a grip... This is driving my crazy.

701
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:57,000
Stay still. Please just stay still.

702
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,400
♫ Love U, if I could convey these feelings of mine ♫

703
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,360
♫ Love U, if you teach me how that feels ♫
