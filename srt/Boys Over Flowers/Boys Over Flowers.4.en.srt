Who do you think you are?

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,910
Who are you to say those things?

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,154
Who asked you to make that kind of request?

9
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:41,491
No, not a request... to beg?

10
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:44,920
Don't you have any pride?

11
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,765
It's not because I don't have any pride.

12
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:53,150
It's because you're in such agony.

13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,073
Because you looked like you would die of sadness.

14

What's it to you?

15

Can I ask you something?

33
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,091
If I said no, would you keep it to yourself?

34
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:26,529
Just act like you usually do. This doesn't suit you.

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,360
When you like someone...

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,140
because you like them too much, considering their feelings,

37
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,300
holding back your own feelings without expressing them.

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,710
Is that good?

39
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,090
What's good about that?!

40
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,170
What's with that?

41
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,280
That's the same thing as ignoring them. What is there as to "liking" them?

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,130
If the world were to fall to pieces tomorrow, then you'd probably die of regret.

You might not be completely stupid.

46
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,240
You're just figuring that out now?

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,000
It's better to regret after you act, instead of regretting after having done nothing. That's my philosophy.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,978
It looks as if Ji Hoo isn't going to show up after all.

49
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,359
Everyone, be well. Stay out of trouble.

50
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:37,100
Have a good trip. I'll come to visit.

51
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,869
Not just to visit but to hold an exhibition.

52
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,643
Take care of your health.

53
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,690
Oh, the kindness disease.

56
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:07,597
I just don't understand you women.

57
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:11,301
Do you know it's been ten years since you've sincerely called me Noona?

58
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:15,138
It seems you've become cool, so I decided to acknowledge you as my noona.

59
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:17,073
Are you complaining?

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,380
Jan Di,

61
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:30,100
please remember my request.

62
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,690
Please take care of yourself.

63
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,190
Take care, everyone.

64
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,930
I'm leaving.

65
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,299
Go. Take care of yourself.

66
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:06,256
Stubborn bastard. How could he not come to see her off?

67
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:07,660
What did I tell you?

68
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,490
Say what you want about me, but Ji Hoo is the real cruel one among us.

69
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,200
He looks so serene, but once he turns his back, he's the scariest.

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,736
Isn't talking behind my back a little too harsh?

71
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:28,979
You—

72
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,213
- What is this?
- When did you get here?

73
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:32,382
Three hours ago.

74
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:33,883
What?

75
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:38,254
Then you got here before us

76
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,360
What are you going to do now?

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,497
Are you just going to stand around here?

78
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,732
Go after her!

79
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:54,070
If she can't stay here, you should go to her.

80
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,206
Didn't you say you loved her?

81
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,244
Hiding behind posts, is that how you show your love?

82
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:04,314
How can you say you love her behaving like that?

83
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:17,127
I'm on the next flight. All my luggage has already been checked in.

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,263
Yoon Ji Hoo!

85
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:23,600
Rascal. He has a knack for surprising people.

86
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,735
When did you get the guts to do something like this?

87
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,410
Thanks to

88
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,340
this little lady.

89
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,074
- What?
- What?

90
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,077
Rascal.

91
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:38,614
- Get over here!
- Cute rascal!

92
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:41,310
Cute!

93
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:48,380
I'm proud of you.

94
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,100
Thank you.

95
00:06:55,698 --> 00:07:00,136
You were the one who made me realize that I have to face reality and be honest with myself.

96
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:06,809
You were the one who taught me that we need the courage to keep going at times.

97
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:13,249
I'm glad to have met a girl like you.

98
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm leaving now.

99
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,720
Geum Jan Di...

100
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,785
What? What do you want?

101
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,990
Listen to what I have to say.

102
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:28,691
I'm only going to say this once, so listen very carefully.

103
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,960
Geum Jan Di... You and I...

104
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,630
(should start dating).

105
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,721
What did he say?

106
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,556
You're not getting in?

107
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,540
Saturday at 4 o'clock. In front of the Nam San Tower.

108
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:32,730
If you're late by even one minute, you're dead.

109
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,200
We need to get it, no matter what.

110
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,904
Come quickly!

111
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,779
Hurry!

112
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:02,652
As soon as it opens at 4 o'clock, run for this.

113
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:06,156
And if you find something that you think will fit, just stuff it in the cart.

114
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:08,457
Wouldn't it be better if we just go together?

115
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,660
Mom needs to go to the cabbage blowout sale.

116
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,263
If the clothes shop were the civil war, this cabbage shop is

117
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,765
- World War II.
- Right.

118
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:20,270
You know, last time the lady standing next to me got her teeth knocked out.

119
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,004
Really?

120
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:26,590
Three months' worth of our shop profits is in our hands. Got it?

121
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,410
- Do your best!
- Do your best!

122
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,316
Oh, it's snowing.

123
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:31,153
We should get going. Dad must be waiting.

124
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:41,220
Saturday. 4 o'clock. In front of the Namsan Tower.

125
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,320
It can't be!

126
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,930
No, no, no way!

127
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:50,073
Why are you mumbling like a crazy girl?

128
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:52,174
- Mom.
- Yes?

129
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:57,313
One wouldn't wait outside for four hours in this snow on a promise that wasn't really made, would he?

130
00:11:57,313 --> 00:12:01,120
No way, unless that person is crazy. Let's go.

131
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:04,652
- Let's go!
- Hang on.

132
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:05,987
That crazy jerk.

133
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,190
Mom, hold this.

134
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,710
What?

135
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,061
Mom, go home first!

136
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:14,297
Yah, Jan Di! Where are you going?

137
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:16,265
I need to go somewhere!

138
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:19,000
Ahh, that girl!

139
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,260
♫ Come to me now ♫

140
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,680

147
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,688
What time is it?

148
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:13,889
Shouldn't I be the one asking that?

149
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,393
Don't you know what time it is right now? Are you that jobless?

150
00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:19,696
Didn't I tell you that you'd be dead if you were late?

151
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:22,190
Did I ever promise that I would come?

152
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,000
You came.

153
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,830
Well, that is...

154
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:31,741
I came to check if you were here.

155
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:34,110
What would've happened if I hadn't come?!

156
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,478
You showed up anyway, didn't you?

157
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:39,890
Also, whose fault is it that I'm in this state?

158
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,350
So stop getting angry like you have any reason to be.

159
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,990
Ah, it's cold.

160
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:52,862
Get up.

161
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:58,367
I'll buy you a nice hot drink.

162
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,603
Or you'll get sick.

163

Here.

168
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,125
This is 30,000 won coffee (about $30).

169
00:14:56,125 --> 00:15:00,429
What a thug. Are you trying to scam me?

170

I don't drink this kind of stuff anyway.

How is it? I was right, wasn't I?

176
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:46,490
It's the same as drinking coffee in the sky-lounge.

177
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,082
Tsk tsk. You'd never be able to run a business, not even a small store.

You need to include tax and service tips.

Wow, so even the rich know how to calculate those kinds of things!

I just pretend not to know.

There's no way you could become rich without knowing those things, could you?

But why did a rich boy like you do something like this?

The number one group in Korea, of course!

467
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:20,004
Things like "Don't even look at a tree that you can't climb"?

00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:24,442
Or "You are a toy to pass the time of Young Masters of the Chaebol. So when you are thrown away, just accept it."

642
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,350
Or... when it's lesser than 33...

643
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:14,250
When it is so, f(x) is greater than 0.

644
00:56:20,415 --> 00:56:23,420
[Everyone is invited to the Tomato party for the commoner Geum Jan Di]

645
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,150
Thank you, Sir.

646
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,680
Going first?

647
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,852
Jan Di, Jan Di.

648
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,350
I...

649
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,160
have something important to take care of, so I'm going to go first, okay?

650
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,570
Jan Di!

651
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,880
Oh, nothing.

652
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,250
Later.

653
00:57:48,235 --> 00:57:49,970
(one, two, three)

654
00:59:58,531 --> 01:00:00,770
There's no need to be in such pain.

655
01:00:04,038 --> 01:00:07,808
Why are you acting like this over a lowly commoner like her?

656
01:00:10,077 --> 01:00:12,080
It doesn't make sense.

657
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:20,387
Please come to your senses! This isn't right.

658
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:23,060
How could Goo Joon Pyo be this way?

659
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,050
This is so unfair!

660
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,710
You...

661
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,498
Weren't you her friend?

662
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:38,630
If you're her friend, why would you say those things?

663
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,548
Because she stole you from me.

664
01:00:58,224 --> 01:01:00,250
Don't go, please.

665
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,710
Take your hands off me.

666
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:12,072
Why Geum Jan Di and not me?

667
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:18,270
What is the reason that it has to be Jan Di?!

668
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,020
No, Goo Joon Pyo! This isn't true.

669
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,000
There's something wrong with this.

670
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,739
How and where did things go wrong that you are in a photo like this?

671
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:46,590
I don't know.

672
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,740
I think someone's trying to set me up.

673
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:00,340
Let's go!

674
01:02:16,268 --> 01:02:18,605
This is it?

675
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:21,375
C'mon. Go for it!

676
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,750
Attack!!

677
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,610
♫ I know I shouldn't feel this way ♫

678
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:57,110
♫ A lie... If I said it was a lie ♫

679
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,280
♫ Will my heart come back to me? ♫

680
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,300
♫ Tears are falling ♫

681
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,050
♫ I can't look at you because I feel sorry ♫

682
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,170
♫ My heart aches ♫

683
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:12,740
♫ What should my first words be? I can't think ♫

684
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:16,120
- F4!
- What's that?

685
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,440
- Shinhwa Group's successor Goo Joon Pyo!
- What?

686
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,890
Ah, so noisy!

687
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,330
♫ You make me have bad feelings ♫

688
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,270
What are you doing?

689
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:29,880
Except for your uniform and shoes, everything that you used

690
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,170
has been replaced overnight.

691
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:36,800
As of today, I announce officially that 2nd year, B class' Geum Jan Di

692
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,400
is Goo Joon Pyo's girlfriend.

693
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,110
I object to that decision!

694
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,930
Ji Hoo!

695
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,650
Where is this again?

696
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:54,810
New Caledonia. It's an island where just our resort is there. It's Shinhwa Group's.

697
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:59,150
♫ It's a very bad feeling, it's a very bad feeling ♫

698
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:01,980
Lo-love?

699
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:22,370
♫ Say something and hold me back, please ♫

700
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:25,380
♫ Don't try to make me feel better ♫

701
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,540
♫ Be like before, ♫

702
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:33,360
♫ Affectionately, just look at me well ♫

703
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:38,130
♫ Warmly, if you say a word ♫

704
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:42,100
♫ I have no other wish ♫

705
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,180
♫ You keep making me ♫

706
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:54,040
♫ Have bad feelings ♫

707
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,130
♫ Isn't a good feeling for me ♫

708
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:59,560
♫ Forgetting you ♫

709
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,340
♫ Isn't a good feeling for me ♫

710
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:07,870
♫ It's a bad feeling, it's a bad feeling ♫

711
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:11,760
♫ Our love won't disappear forever ♫
