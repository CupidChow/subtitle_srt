00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,939
It's too loud! Be quiet!

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,917
- It's really delicious!
- We are...

10
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:34,518
- Don't eat that. Just put it anywhere.
- Hey, be quiet!

11
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:38,156
Butler Lee, it's so noisy.

12
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:39,256
It's almost time for him to wake up.

13
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,291
Should we sit him at the head of the table? Or...

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,767
No, the middle of the table. There, there...

15
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,262
Butler Lee!

16
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,595
- Ah, dad!
- You sit here. Got it? And...

17
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:48,399

It isn't much, but please eat up, Goo Seo Bang.
(T/N : SeoBang = hubby/daughter's husband)

Right, right, right.

26

This jjim was done really well since I cooked it for a long time.

27

Here.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,798
It's really good. Just try it.

We don't get to eat pancakes even on national holidays.

34

This is the first time we've had a breakfast like this ever!

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,090
Eat this.

00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:54,080
Did Joon Pyo go somewhere?

37
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,610
He is still sleeping.

38
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:00,600
Tell him to come down.

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,660
Just let him be.

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,690
He was up late last night with the F4 young masters.

41
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,676
At his age, he still hangs around with those kids.

42
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,077
What about those kids?

43
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:19,016
Don't you know how glad I am that Joon Pyo has such friends?

44
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:23,670
The heir of Shinhwa can't have any, and he doesn't need friends.

Mom.

46
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:27,321
In his position, he can't afford to let anyone be on par with him.

47
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:31,330
He has to be cold-hearted. That way, if needed, he can even cut off his family.

48
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,900
Don't you understand anything?

49
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:37,370
I would rather die than understand that way of thinking.

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,573
Do you know how many times we have breakfast together each year?

51
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,243
And whose fault is that?

52
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,170
Bring him.

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,090
Forget about it. I'll go myself.

59
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,070
You don't eat only kimchi everyday...

60
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,450
No, hyung. We do. We only eat kimchi.

61
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,895

- Honey, is this the aekjeot?
- Yes.

Let me mix them for you.

83
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,559
No, that's not how you do it. You have to spread it out like this.

84
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,027
You have to learn how to make this before getting married.

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,070
Try it!

87
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,370
- Right. That's it.
- Right.

88
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,990
- How's it?
- Is it tasty?

89
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,540
It's good.

90
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,950
- Here.
- Honey.

91
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,190
Come here, come here. Let me wipe it off.

You guys, have you ever made kimjang?

You haven't eaten a fishcake at a cart bar, right?

I liked him better when he was messing up proverbs.

it feels like a burden being dragged around in Joon Pyo's world.

166
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,567
There's no such thing as Joon Pyo's world or Jan Di's world.

167
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,610
Just like you and I are of the same world,

168
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:43,410
If it is a burden, you can drag him into your world.

169
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,570
Isn't that your specialty?

170
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:56,380
I'll take your advice.

171
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,270
Thank you, Sunbae! See you again.

172
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,373
Don't keep doing that. Just call her first.

173
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,250
Stop and think about it.

174
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,940
If you call her first, you become a slave.

175
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,650
I won't call.

176
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,850
I won't move a finger until she calls me first.

177
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,330
That's right! You are doing well.

178
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,090
That is a basic principle right out of the playboy's rule book. It's called "Pushing and Pulling".

179
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,740
How can you say that as you're watching him do that?

180
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,260
Withdrawal symptoms of Geum Jan Di... It should be a mental disease.

181
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,970
It's her.

182
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:15,070
Cool it. Relax.

183
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,383
Hello?

184
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:27,954
Geum Jan Di?

185
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:31,924
Who is Geum Jan Di?

186
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:34,140
That is a little overboard.

187
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,180
A little?! It's too much.

188
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,135
That's right, I remember now. What's up?

189
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:46,038
Am I free right now?

190
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:50,310
I am so busy that I didn't even remember that you haven't called me in three days and thirteen hours.

191
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,410
Hey man, whoa, whoa.

192
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,820
I'm embarrassed to call him my friend.

193
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,490
What?

194
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,200
What do you take me for?

195
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,223
Why would I go there with a stranger?

196
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:07,460
I'm not going! I'm hanging up.

197
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,230
Did you see?

198
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,460
Did you see?

199
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,790
Did you hear me raise my voice? Huh?

200
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:21,907
It was me who hung up the phone.

201
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,310
Why did you get angry?

202
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,270
She said we should have a double date thing.

203
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,782
Double date? With whom?

204
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:33,118
Could it be, Miss Ga Eul?

205
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,955
That girl, she's pretty interesting.

206
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:37,290
Joon Pyo, aren't you going?

207
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,890
Dates are for two people.

208
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,360
And, what the hell, how lame... it's in front of a burger place.

209
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,699
Then I'll go in your place.

210
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:49,236
What? Why would you go?

211
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:51,830
I want to know what commoners do on dates.

212
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,170
It could be interesting, I think.

213
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:57,809
Shut it! Meet at the shooting range by ten tomorrow!

214
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,512
Got it?

215
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,856
He won't come. He didn't like the idea.

216
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:12,158
Then why are you waiting?

217
00:19:12,158 --> 00:19:14,570
Who is waiting?

218
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:21,010
I'm just waiting to meet your new boyfriend.

219
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:27,906
Who's that?

220
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:31,309
Could it be Geum Jan Di?

221
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,345
Goo Joon Pyo?

222
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,750
What a coincidence!

223
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,020
Coincidence?

224
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:52,998
It's just that I was passing by and a country bumpkin like you was standing there shivering.

225
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:55,001
I came over just in case...

226
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:59,305
Really? Then just go on with your business.

227
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:02,208
I was just waiting for Ga Eul's boyfriend.

228
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,177
Why are you waiting for someone else's boyfriend?

229
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:07,213
Just leave.

230
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:09,048
Don't test me!

231
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:14,887
I'm done with my business. Do you want me to stay with you?

232
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:18,024
What?

233
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:22,128
Do you think it would be alright to stick to them like a booger while they're on a date?

234
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,530
Booger?

235
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,900
Fine, I'll be nice. I'll stay with you.

236
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,080
This is great, Jan Di!

237
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:34,840
I have a bad feeling about this.

238
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,444
But why isn't he here yet? He's already 30 minutes late.

239
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:40,346
What manners!

240
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,716
Sorry, I'll try calling him.

241
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,252
Hurry up.

242
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:53,580
I lost money and got stood up.

243
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,610
That Goo Joon Pyo is seriously no help.

244
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:03,840
It's cold. If I knew it was going to be like this, I would have just played a game of squash.

245
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,841
How did you know that Goo Joon Pyo wasn't going to come?

246
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:13,012
I'll treat you with the money I won on the bet.

247
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,489
Why are you so late?

248
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:27,159
Hi! It's nice to meet you. I'm Hong Soo Pyo!

249
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,580
Hello!

250
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,290
I'm Geum Jan Di, a friend of Ga Eul's.

251
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,440
And, this is...

252
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,630
Goo Joon Pyo...

253
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,790
Whoa! Your hairstyle rocks.

254
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,830
Where did you have it done? It looks like a sea shell.

255
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:53,932
If I put this on my blog, it'll be a huge hit!

256
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:56,401
- What?
- Oppa!

257
00:21:56,401 --> 00:22:00,530
Now that I think about it, Soo Pyo and Joon Pyo, just like brothers.

258
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,120
Call me hyung (older brother).

259
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,180
Let's get along.

260
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,230
What?

261
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:15,160
Who the hell does he think he is?

262
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,280
He didn't even apologize when he was the one who was late.

263
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,690
What? Sea shell bread?
(T/N: a croissant is called "sea shell bread" in Korean)

264
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:23,650
Goo Joon Pyo,

265
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,390
I'm sorry.

266
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:29,550
Should we just leave?

267
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,600
We can just leave. Let's do that.

268
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,990
No,

269
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,070
let's go on a commoner's date just this once.

00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,569
What the hell is this place?

286
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:14,172
Dongsaeng, is this your first time coming to a place like this?
(Dongsaeng = Younger sibling)

287
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:16,408
Have you never eaten small intestines?

288
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:19,911
- Small intestines?
- The inner parts of cows and pigs.

289
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:21,546
Intestines?

290
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:24,983
You don't know the small intestines and the large intestines?

291
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:31,088
What the hell, Dongsaeng. Are you choking?

292
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:34,150
Jan Di, maybe you should rethink your choice.

293
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,620
How can you trust your life to a guy that can't eat small intestines?

294
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:40,640
What did you say?

295
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,869
Ah, it looks delicious!

296
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,704
I'm going to eat as much as I can!

297
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:51,609
Please try some. Chew slowly. It's savory and quite good.

298
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:54,846
Hey, just look at him. He doesn't seem like he can eat it.

299
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:57,810
Don't overdo it, just give up.

300
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,510
Since there is not enough for us...

301
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:01,650
Who says I can't eat it?

302
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,408
- Are you okay?
- Of course I'm okay!

303
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:25,750
Are you really okay?

304
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,380
I don't think so!

305
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:36,100
I'm warning you, be careful.

306
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,991
I'm being nice and you don't even realize it. Idiots rush in where tigers fear to tread.

307
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,660
What?

308
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,390
Dongsaeng, by any chance did you mean to say fools rush in where angels fear to tread?

309
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,268
Dongsaeng, you're really funny!

310

Don't you guys go to Shinhwa High?

311

That really is a school that you just pay money to attend!

It's my first time coming somewhere like this.

What are you? A little match girl?

Why are you going around without your gloves?

I'm at the skating rink.

00:29:03,395 --> 00:29:07,696
I'm sorry about Soo Pyo oppa.

359
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:12,202
It's fine. He doesn't seem like a bad person.

360
00:29:12,202 --> 00:29:17,050
It may have been a bit uneasy, but I think we've achieved our objective, right?

361
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,140
Objective?

362
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:22,620
Look how hard Joon Pyo Sunbae tries to meet you at your level.

363
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,980
I'm honestly impressed.

364
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,420
He does seem like he's trying in his own little way.

365
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,710
Yeah, I think you can trust him now.

366
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,995
But why are they taking so long? Should we go see?

367
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:47,020
Goo Joon Pyo!

368
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,980
Oppa!

369
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:53,343
What are you doing?

370
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,482
Why did you hit him? What's wrong with you?

371
00:29:57,482 --> 00:30:00,320
- Do I need a reason to beat this bastard?
- Hey!

You.

If you're going to date a guy, at least pick a good one.

374
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:12,997
You'd better stop right there!

375
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:19,104
Apologize!

376

Hey! Goo Joon Pyo! Hey!

380
00:30:41,426 --> 00:30:42,900
How did this happen?

381
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,490
I don't know.

382
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:49,499
I wanted to become friends with him, but he started hitting me for no reason.

383
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,770
He could have just said it if he didn't like me.

384
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,738
Ouch! My teeth are aching.

385
00:30:54,738 --> 00:30:56,774
It's going to take eight weeks to fully recover from this.

No, don't say anything. Joon Pyo wouldn't have done something like that without a reason.

What are you saying?

401
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,480
That day, Oppa kept making mistakes,

402
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,230
and Joon Pyo sunbae was being patient.

403
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,097
There must be a reason.

404
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:27,340
Reason? What reason?

405
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,690
Have his actions ever made any sense before?

406
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,590
Every time, he does as he likes.

407
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,832
That bastard still has a lot to learn. Just wait and see.

00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:39,967
What are you going to do?

On Geum Jan Di's honor, I'll get an apology.

410
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,382
Geum Jan Di, what's up?

411
00:32:56,382 --> 00:33:00,553
I came because I have something to tell Goo Joon Pyo, so please pass on this message.

412
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,622
He's right next to you.

413
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,862
She said she wants to talk to you.

414
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:14,000
I have nothing to say, so tell her to do whatever she wants.

415
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,336
He said to pass it on.

416
00:33:15,336 --> 00:33:21,474
Ask him what country's courtesy is hitting someone without a reason and not apologizing?

417
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:23,543
Hey, you got in trouble again?

418
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,079
She asked what country's courtesy is that.

419
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,382
Pass it on that my fist is a waste for that bastard.

420
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,820
He said it was a waste. Hey!

421
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,130
How long do I have to do this for?

422
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,090
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

423
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:43,330
Please tell him to listen good because this is my last warning.

424
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:47,868
Because of what he did, my friend is really upset.

425
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:51,138
If he doesn't apologize, it's really the end between us.

426
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:56,420
A "thank you" wouldn't even be enough for getting rid of trash like that.

427
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,915
Tell her I won't do it, even if I die. She can do whatever she wants.

428
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,210
Joon Pyo!

I got it, Goo Joon Pyo.

00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,289
Hey, of course. This is just like you.

431
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:11,480
From the beginning, it was impossible for you to force yourself

432
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,920
to match someone else's level and get along with others.

433
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,910
But, what I don't understand is why Ga Eul, who is at no fault,

434
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,890
has to be punished for that.

435
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:26,860
Goo Joon Pyo I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore.

437
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,760
What's wrong with you guys? Really?

00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,449
Please excuse me. Goodbye.

How did you know I was here?

443
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:32,880
You swim when you're frustrated.

444
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,170
You're frustrated over something now,

445
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:39,445
so you're here at the swimming pool. Is it that difficult?

446
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:42,215
If it's about Goo Joon Pyo, I'm not going to talk about it.

447
00:35:42,215 --> 00:35:43,984
When did I say it was about Joon Pyo?

448
00:35:43,984 --> 00:35:47,240
If he did something wrong to me, I would just be angry with him,

449
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,020
but this is about Ga Eul, so I can't.

450
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,659
They were only trying to help us.

451
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:56,740
You're talking about Joon Pyo now, right?

452
00:35:57,898 --> 00:35:59,366
Am I allowed to answer?

453
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:04,370
Anyway, I will never forgive him this time.

00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,960
If Ga Eul breaks up with her boyfriend because of this,

455
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,670
how will I be able to face Goo Joon Pyo again?

456
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:13,080
You said you're not going to talk about him, but you are.

457
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:19,386
I was hoping you wouldn't need this. This won't do.

a guy is with a girl he likes,

00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,265
Plutocrat? You should introduce me to him!

483
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:14,630
Give it up.

484
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,830
That fool seemed like he had a ton of money, but really bad taste.

485
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,650
That high schooler had an elementary kid's body.

486
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,670
Do you know how poor they look?

487
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,915
- They're both mush.
- Mush? From which club?

488
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:30,852
No, they work at a porridge shop.

489
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:34,754
- What? But her boyfriend is a plutocrat?
- Right.

490
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:37,820
- She's that pretty?
- Pretty?

491
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,520
I told him I would introduce him to a fine girl like you,

492
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,010
and he starts throwing punches for no reason!

493
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:53,375
Yeah, okay.

494
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:57,310
Me? I'm at the skating rink.

495
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,390
What do you mean why?

496
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm playing with some kids. Oppa's working hard.

497
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:08,054
What? Really?

498
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,124
I got it! Wait for me!

499
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,034
Joon Pyo dongsaeng, why don't we talk as men?

500
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:26,539
That Jan Di(grass) or Japcho(weeds), isn't she nothing?

501
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,409
Does she have something on you?

502
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,777
What did you say?

503
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:33,740
Does she have money?

504
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,440
You could do better.

505
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:39,051
What're you trying to say?

506
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:42,670
Don't you want to just get this over with, and go to a club with me?

507
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:48,520
If we go, there are girls that you can't even compare to the ones over there.

508
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,430
What's wrong with you?

509
00:39:57,669 --> 00:40:00,350
If you keep on talking crap about my girlfriend,

510
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,970
I'm not gonna let you eat with that mouth anymore!

511
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,878
Understand?!

512
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:14,555
Was what you just said true? Hong Soo Pyo?

513
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:16,060
You guys...

514
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,750
I'm asking you if it's true.

515
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,543
What're you going to do if it's true?

516
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,429
Oppa, who are they?

517
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:24,264
Do you know them?

518
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:27,100
Does it look like I would know them?

519
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,940
Oppa.

520
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,070
What's your reason for not calling Ga Eul?

521
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,910
My reason?

522
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,750
Fine.

523
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:42,570
Do you always have to be told harshly to know if something is sh*t or Korean bean paste?

524
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,540
Good that we met.

525
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,530
Hey you, ugly girl! Why don't you try to send less texts?

526
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,420
Are you a stalker?

527
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,130
My inbox is full. It's a complete nuisance!

528
00:41:12,244 --> 00:41:13,850
You!

529
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,670
One is for my friend Ga Eul and the other is for my boyfriend.

530
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:23,892
If you ever appear in front of Ga Eul, I'm going to kill you!

531
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:25,780
Understood?

532
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:29,396
Who are you? Go home!

533
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,640
What kind of guy is that?

534
00:41:39,572 --> 00:41:42,070
Even so, I'm glad.

535
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:45,178
What?

536
00:41:45,178 --> 00:41:50,216
Joon Pyo Sunbae isn't a bad guy after all.

537
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:53,286
Ga Eul...

538
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:57,423
I'm fine, really!

539
00:41:57,423 --> 00:42:00,593
Jan Di. Hurry up and go.

540
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:05,264
- Where?
- You should apologize to Joon Pyo Sunbae.

541
00:42:05,264 --> 00:42:08,201
That...

542
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:11,036
Hurry up and tell him you're sorry.

543
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:14,306
Then I'll feel better.

544
00:42:14,306 --> 00:42:17,176
Will you be all right if you're alone?

545
00:42:17,176 --> 00:42:21,080
Of course! Don't worry.

546
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,383
Hurry up and go.

547
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:25,384
I'll call you.

548
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,081
It's enough now, just give up, please!

549
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,580
Is it now my turn after father's to be threatened by you taking medicine?

550
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:47,264
[Potter]
[Professor So Hyun Sub]

551
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:58,042
Your lips are like pottery of Jon Comed.

552
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,330
[Potter]
[Professor So Hyun Sub]

553
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:33,670
Lips...

554
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,140
What?

555
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,255
You've got lipstick there.

556
00:44:45,255 --> 00:44:47,491
Thank you.

557
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,064
- You are the fourth.
- Huh?

558
00:44:55,064 --> 00:44:58,700
You're his fourth girlfriend this year.

559
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,940
For being that, you are much too beautiful.

560
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,390
♫ No way ♫

561
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:36,450
♫ I didn't know that we would break up ♫

562
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,020
♫ I didn't know back then ♫

563
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,020
♫ I just followed you ♫

564
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,860
♫ I just looked at you ♫

565
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:54,390
♫ So I couldn't see the break up that was approaching us ♫

566
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,100
♫ Something like love ♫

567
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,630
♫ Something like break up ♫

568
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:08,550
♫ I don't want to do any of that again ♫

569
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,190
♫ I only get hurt ♫

570
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:19,170
♫ My heart is only damaged and hurting ♫

571
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:24,870
♫ Because of love (I don't want to do it) ♫

572
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,440
♫ (I don't want to do it) Something like break up ♫

573
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,061
♫ If it hurts this much ♫

574
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:32,829
Stop the car.

575
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,950
♫ If it's such sort of a pain ♫

576
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,000
♫ Even if I die... ♫

577
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,472
Aren't you past the age of crying in the middle of the street?

578
00:46:46,843 --> 00:46:52,382
Girls, you know, sometimes think it's pretty to cry.

579
00:46:52,382 --> 00:46:55,551
But that's not true.

580
00:47:03,392 --> 00:47:05,395
Miss Ga Eul!

581
00:47:09,832 --> 00:47:11,568
Miss Ga Eul!

582
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:20,377
It wasn't me.

583
00:47:22,445 --> 00:47:24,447
It wasn't me!

584
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:26,182
Miss Ga Eul!

585
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:31,800
Miss Ga Eul! Please!

586
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,620
Miss Ga Eul!

587
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:41,087
Two pair. You win? What do you have?

588
00:47:41,087 --> 00:47:43,077
- Yay!
- What?

589
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:45,402
There's nothing that goes right.

590
00:47:49,472 --> 00:47:50,974
You guys haven't gotten back together yet?

591
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:52,640
What do you mean get back together?

592
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,370
Even if she were to get on her knees and beg, I wouldn't even blink an eye.

593
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,440
Well, let's hear the whole story.

594
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,980
I have a feeling you're not completely in the right either.

595
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:02,210
Why wouldn't I be in the right?

596
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,250
I went on some double or triple date with her.

597
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,250
I ate some intestines or cow intestines for her.

598
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:10,720
I got rid of some asshole too. I did all the right things.

599
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,263
Then you're not gonna see her even if she comes herself?

600
00:48:13,263 --> 00:48:16,833
I'm telling you, I'm not letting this go.

601
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:20,703
It won't work Geum Jan Di, you're just going to have to leave.

602
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:30,120
Hey, when did you come?

603
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:34,240
I didn't know you were so mad.

604
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,880
I must have been thinking about myself the whole time.

605
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:41,550
Sorry. I'll just go.

606
00:48:42,903 --> 00:48:45,000
Just go? Go where?

607
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,831
Since you came, you have to tell me why.

608
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,270
Do you think this is the sort of place you can just walk in and out of?

609
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,960
Goo Joon Pyo.

610
00:49:05,146 --> 00:49:07,817
Please accept my apology!
(T/N: In Korean, "apology" and "apple" are spelled the same)

611
00:49:19,228 --> 00:49:22,160
If an apology could solve everything, there wouldn't be a need for laws—

612
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,860
And police?

613
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,903
It seems you already know.

614
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:29,973
What am I supposed to do?

615
00:49:29,973 --> 00:49:31,975
Three wishes.

616
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,776
Three wishes?

617
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:35,612
Then I will accept your apology.

618
00:49:35,612 --> 00:49:37,460
What do you mean three—?

619
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:42,306
That many?

620
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:46,250
Guys, going against Goo Joon Pyo when he is right,

621
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,950
is it a big sin or not?

622
00:49:48,959 --> 00:49:50,780
It's big.

623
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:56,066
All right, all right. I'll do it.

624
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:59,604
But you have to say that all in one minute.
Start!

625
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:01,432
Start!

626
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:02,905
Hey! You can't do that!

627
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:04,670
What do you mean I can't do that, I'm doing it.

628
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,970
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

629
00:50:07,978 --> 00:50:10,490
Hey, wait. Stop that!

630
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:12,280
Sit down for now.

631
00:50:12,282 --> 00:50:15,400
Hey stop!

632
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,920
- Stand up.
- There's only one left, 50!

633
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,710
51, 52, 53. 54.

634
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,370
Stop!

635
00:50:25,061 --> 00:50:28,210
"Oppa,

636
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,620
I was wrong." Say it.

637
00:50:36,063 --> 00:50:37,874
Didn't you hear?

638
00:50:37,874 --> 00:50:39,810
"Oppa,

639
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,430
I was wrong", say that once.

640
00:50:48,152 --> 00:50:50,086
Goo Joon Pyo.

641
00:50:50,086 --> 00:50:52,860
Didn't you see how Ga Eul did it?

642
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,690
Say it after me. Let's do it!

643
00:50:56,461 --> 00:51:00,360
"Oppa, I was wrong!"

644
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,130
O—

645
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,641
Ah, I can't do it! I won't do it!

646
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:14,710
Whether you accept it or not, just do whatever you want.

647
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,100
I can't. I can't!

648
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,784
Hey Geum Jan Di! Where are you going?

649
00:51:20,784 --> 00:51:23,820
That's why when she apologized, you should have accepted it.

650
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,455
Are you going to give that back?

651
00:51:30,393 --> 00:51:32,595
Hey! How can you eat that!

652
00:51:32,595 --> 00:51:35,198
I was given this for an apology.

653
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,650
Jerk.

654
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:58,880
This thing... looks pretty fragile, right?

655
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:24,690
It's stronger than it looks.

656
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,186
Do you know how long it took to make it that strong?

657
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:36,410
Sorted, stepped on, cut,

658
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,350
then heated at 1300 degrees.

659
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,332
That's not the end.

660
00:52:42,332 --> 00:52:47,704
If after all that it's still not right, it has to be thrown out.

661
00:52:47,704 --> 00:52:49,405
Like this.

662
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,150
To become strong,

663
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:32,280
this is what you have to go through.

664
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:35,585
Just like what you went through today.

665
00:53:39,523 --> 00:53:44,770
I think I understand what you're saying.

666
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,910
Thank you.

667
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:51,000
Then shall we go out now?

668
00:53:52,112 --> 00:53:54,003
Where?

669
00:53:54,003 --> 00:53:56,439
I'm having a bad day too.

670
00:53:56,439 --> 00:53:59,809
At times like this, you've just gotta let it go.

671
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:02,279
Let's go! Hurry.

672
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:12,940
♫ Stand by me, look at me ♫

673
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:17,390
♫ I might not know love yet ♫

674
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,550
♫ Stand by me, watch over me ♫

675
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,480

677
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,030

678

♫ I want to buy a rose ♫

♫ Such a side of myself surprises me ♫

680
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,980
♫ I feel like my heart is going to you ♫

681
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,370
♫ This world is beautiful ♫

682

00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:39,900
♫ Now hold my hand, my hand ♫

690
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,721
Who is that guy?

691
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:39,590
So Yi Jung, isn't it?

692
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:42,705
F4 don't come to places like here. What's going on?

693
00:56:42,705 --> 00:56:46,163
Now that I see him, he shines, he shines!

694
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:49,025
F4? What is that?

695
00:56:49,025 --> 00:56:53,076
Handsome heirs. Haven't you heard of F4?

696
00:57:01,345 --> 00:57:02,550
Excuse me...

697
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,860
Me, me?

698
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,073
Yes, please tell me!

699
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:09,250
Could I play a song?

700
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,660
Play? Sure! Go up there, please.

701
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,680
You can play all night.

702
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,580
Thank you.

703
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:06,280
There is someone here who has completely stolen my heart.

704
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:16,921
I am going to play my heart for her.

705
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,320
Gosh! I already said I was sorry!

706
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:53,010
Why is he calling me to meet him all the way out here?

707
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:57,460
Goo Joon Pyo.

708
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:02,120
Do you really think I'd say, "Oppa, I was wrong"?

709
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,260
I would rather—

710
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:23,930
- You—
- There you go again.

711
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:26,710
Again, you're so easily impressed.

712
01:00:39,563 --> 01:00:41,430
Goo Joon Pyo.

713
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,273
How did you do all this?

714
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:53,644
I tried to make this place look like the Champs-Élysées.

715
01:00:54,922 --> 01:00:56,976
Do you like it?

716
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:58,750
Do you like it?
Yes, It's pretty.

717
01:01:00,818 --> 01:01:02,990
It's really pretty.

718
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,789
It's like Christmas.

719
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:08,550
What's so good about Christmas?

720
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,430
You don't like it?

721
01:01:11,495 --> 01:01:14,670
Just think about it and you'll feel happy.

722
01:01:15,398 --> 01:01:17,380
Not once,

723
01:01:18,035 --> 01:01:20,770
do I remember being happy about it.

724
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,474

Hey, Geum JanDi,

739
01:02:17,861 --> 01:02:20,197
has the kimchi I made fermented?

740
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,502
If someone hears, they'll think you made all that kimchi by yourself.

741
01:02:27,261 --> 01:02:29,473
I want to eat it.

742
01:02:29,473 --> 01:02:30,796
Really?

743
01:02:30,796 --> 01:02:32,820
Yes.

744
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:37,740
I wanna eat the fish your mother de-boned too.

745
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:43,755
The fishcakes your father bought for me were also delicious.

746
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:50,420
I, uh...

747
01:02:51,695 --> 01:02:56,550
I never knew what a family was like.

748
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:00,570
But after I saw your family,

749
01:03:01,338 --> 01:03:03,541
I think, I get it a little.

750
01:03:06,911 --> 01:03:09,246
Can I come over again?

751
01:03:09,246 --> 01:03:11,715
Have you ever needed permission before?

752
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,418
This isn't a joke.

753
01:03:30,267 --> 01:03:32,102
I want to come over again.

754
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,273

01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:40,130
