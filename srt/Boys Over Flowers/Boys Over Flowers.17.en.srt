00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,627
No, I don't want to ride this.

166
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,372
If you want to ride it, ride it yourself woman.

167
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,200
It's a date, why would I ride it by myself?

168
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,675
I know. Are you scared of heights? Is that why?

169
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:02,837
It really doesn't suit you.

170
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:04,767
Who's scared of heights?

171
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:07,722
If you own up, you don't need to go on it.

172
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:11,102
As soon as you get on the cable car, "Save me!"

173
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:12,991
You're not going to be like that, are you?

174
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,298
Why does this monkey make me look like some idiot?

175
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:18,772
Fine! Let's ride it. I'll just ride it.

176
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,750
♫ I am walking, following you ♫

177
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:34,200
♫ I hide behind the moonlight there ♫

[Goo Joon Pyo ♥ Geum Jan Di]

179
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,800
♫ For the rain to at least fall ♫

180
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,120
♫ Shall I request the clouds again? ♫

181
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,490
♫ So that I can hug your drenched heart ♫

182
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:04,140
♫ Love you, recalling you now ♫

183
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,770
♫ I close my eyes again ♫

184

♫ I love you, if I could fill your two eyes ♫

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,750

♫ My dear ♫

193
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:08,817
Is the studying going well?

194
00:25:08,817 --> 00:25:14,104
If I get into medical school with all this studying, then that would be a real miracle.

195
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,638
You're really good at miracles.

196
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,977
Don't you remember?

197
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:24,260
Wondergirl, Geum Jan Di.

198
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:33,181
Even if I don't get into medical school, I still want to help out at that grandpa's clinic.

199
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:59,360
Can't you make up with your grandpa?

200
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:03,195
We've never fought.

201
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,400
Because I'm the one who was thrown away.

202
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,058
It's not like that.

203
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,116
Your grandpa's also living with a lot of regret.

204
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:17,310
- And...
- And?

205
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:22,250
Sunbae,

206
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,820
he also misses you.

207
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,256
Why?

208
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:37,080
I always feel like you understand things better than I do.

209
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,324
That person (Min Seo Hyun)

210
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:42,113
and grandpa as well.

211
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:46,663
I... just...

212
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:55,428
Are you really going to be like this?

213
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:58,382
It's always me asking.

214
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:01,687
And even when we're together, you never agree.

215
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:04,030
You really are being annoying.

216
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,343
If you're really that unsatisfied, you can stop chasing me around.

217
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:10,260
It's because I feel anxious.

218
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,007
What?

219
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:20,561
I keep feeling anxious.

220
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:30,559
If you make me believe, if you make me certain,

221
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,978
I'll stop chasing after you.

222
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:36,487
I'll wait patiently.

223
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,738
What do you want me to do?

224
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,430
Kiss me.

225
00:28:58,107 --> 00:29:01,010
Hey, Joon. Let's go together.

226
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:44,918
Hey, Joon, I said let's go together.

227
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,995
Hey, what is this again?

228
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,985
It's annoying, so go over there.

229
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:53,649
But there are 99 things I've alyways wanted to do once I got a boyfriend.

230
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:55,033
You're not already annoyed, are you?

231
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:57,087
99 things?

232
00:29:57,784 --> 00:30:01,900
I don't want to, so get another guy to do them with. I'm busy.

233
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,746
Okay, then let's do just one a day.

234
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:09,674
Then, when we do all the 99 things, we'll reach our 100th day and become real lovers.

235
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,847
What 100th day?

236
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:14,449
You really plan on being together that long?

237
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:21,355
Then since today's our first day, can't we make it special and do two things?

238
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,010
Can you...

239
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,760
take me somewhere?

240
00:31:48,104 --> 00:31:51,272
You probably were an otter during your last life.

241
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:53,506
Me?

242
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:55,831
You're similar.

243
00:31:55,831 --> 00:32:00,398
You both are diligent, off-the-wall, cute,

244
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,030
and can't live without water.

245
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,127
Couldn't you just say something like the Little Mermaid or something?

246
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:13,476
The Little Mermaid won't do.

247
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:19,619
Turning into bubbles because you can't forget your love...

248
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:21,780
is too sad, isn't it?

249
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,971
It seems like the otter is hungry.

250
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:42,840
Let's go! I'll buy dinner.

251
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:58,047
Monkey, why should I go to a place like this? Go by yourself.

252
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:01,608
Just give the food a try, it's really good.

253
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:03,370
Joon Pyo.

254
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,850
Oh... it's Jan Di!

255
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:11,777
Jan Di, it's like we have telepathy, right?

256
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:34,210
[Cha Eun Jae]

257
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:38,930
Hello, my name is Cha Eun Jae.

258
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,860
Hello.

259
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,807
One moment...

260
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,112
Please come in.

261
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:57,080
Welcome! I welcome you to the world of pottery.

262
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,980
Use this.

263
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,530
Press it this way.

264
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,404
Ah, thank you.

265
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:49,589
The one who is grateful is me.

266
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,010
What?

267
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,683
Usually, older women like to come.

268
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:59,062
I'm happy because someone young like you came.

269
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,237
How did you get interested in pottery?

270
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,710
Someone I know does pottery.

271
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,652
Is that someone a person you like?

272
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,356
Huh?

273
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:15,301
Because you want to get to know him,

274
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:19,820
you want to learn so you can do it together.

275
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,860
I know that feeling well.

276
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,229
Teacher, did you also...

277
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:27,497
We were childhood friends.

278
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:33,160
While other kids were playing house, we learned to make pottery together.

279
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,670
Did your boyfriend also become a potter?

280
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,352
He's a potter.

281
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:47,220
But he didn't become my boyfriend.

282
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,404
I don't need sympathy.

283
00:35:51,404 --> 00:35:55,020
Thanks to it, I became even stronger.

284
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,630
This piece here.

285
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:06,110
Even though it looks weak on the outside, on the inside it's actually very strong.

286
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,003
Turned upside down,and stepped on.

287
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:13,881
After it's cut endlessly over and over again on the potter wheel, then...

288
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,594
1300 graus.

289
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:20,043
That's right! After heating it in a kiln at 1300 degrees,

290
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:23,768
you can make something with as a strong soul as this one.

291
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:27,110
But, Ga Eul, how did you know that?

292
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,760
Ah, it's because I've heard it before.

293
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,802
To me, that friend was,

294
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:40,830
was my kiln and my potter's wheel.

295
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,041
Have you forgotten that person now?

296
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:52,848
Ga Eul, please bring your friend here sometime.

297
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:54,750
I'm curious.

298
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:45,336
This is my studio.

299
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:48,790
Do your "job" somewhere else.

300
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:51,970
Son,

301
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,390
don't you do the same thing?

302
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,330
Why don't the two of us try to get along, okay?

303
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,497
If you're going to be this way, I'll move to another studio.

304
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:09,150
You can not do that.

305
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,278
I'm the one that should leave.

306
00:38:13,278 --> 00:38:15,660
But you can't.

307
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:18,150
Did you forget

308
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,380
that the person to take on the "So" name

309
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:24,877
is not me, but Yi Jung.

310
00:38:24,877 --> 00:38:27,302
You.

311
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:29,370
I've never said I wanted to do that.

312
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,187
You've never said you didn't want it either.

313
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,011
Am I not correct?

314
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,850
Why must you live like this?

315
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:49,058
Because I'm bored.

316
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,288
Living is so boring, son.

317
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:57,844
Have you ever lived properly,

318
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,870
for even one second?

319
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:06,760
The woman who makes me want to live right

320
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:11,266
came only once in my entire life.

321
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:16,820
If you lose a woman like that

322
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:22,459
every other woman is the same.

323
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,637
It's just all meaningless repetition.

324
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,300
Mom...

325
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,440
Don't you think that you're being too cruel to Mom?

326
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,084

01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:07,184
Because of that...

493
01:01:08,591 --> 01:01:10,502
you're quitting?

494
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,531
So you're leaving me alone like this?

495
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:25,295
You're running away!

496
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:27,260
You're leaving me alone in this house.

497
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:32,540
Leaving me all the responsibilities and running away!

498
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:52,249
Are you alright?

499
01:01:54,457 --> 01:01:59,560
I keep forgetting that I'm not supposed to swim.

500
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,070
I'm supposed to be your fireman.

501
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,890
And now your lifeguard too?

502
01:02:09,237 --> 01:02:13,750
I forgot something at the spa. I'll fetch it and be right back.

503
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,720
Don't worry.

504
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,920
I won't get into trouble again.

505
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:30,530
♫ It's so hard. From a step back ♫

506
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:37,560
♫ Watching you like this ♫

507
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:46,750
♫ Because of my tears, because I'm missing you ♫

508
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:52,410
♫ You are fading ♫

509
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:57,638
♫ Can we go back to how things were before ♫

510
01:02:57,638 --> 01:03:00,940
I'll take her from here.

511
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:09,200
♫  When I didn't even know your name ♫

512
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:17,640
♫ I'll just watch you for a little longer ♫

513
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:24,830
♫ I don't see anything else but you ♫

514
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:33,830
♫ I'll just watch you for today ♫

515
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:38,790
♫ I promise I'll forget you tomorrow ♫

516
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:42,580
What?

517
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:10,360
♫ On the days that I think of you too much ♫

518
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,690
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

519
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:18,950
♫ "I miss you" plays on my mouth ♫

520
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:20,800
♫ Alone again... ♫
