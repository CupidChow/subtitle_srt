00:21:58,043 --> 00:21:59,428
What?

167
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:03,090
Because I have money, status, and looks.

168
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,390
I have all that.

169
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,575
I don't need anything.

170
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:11,936
Geum Jan Di, all you need to be is Geum Jan Di.

171
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,610
It's really pretty.

172
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:25,899
Do you see the brightest star right there?

173
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:27,439
Yes.

174
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:32,922
It's a star called Sirius in the Orion Constellation.

175
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:36,308
It's the brightest star in the winter sky.

176
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:39,966
You could say its existence looks like Goo Joon Pyo.

177
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:42,326
How?

178
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:44,864
Then I'm that one.

179
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,405
That one, that one, that one!

180
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,237
I want to be that one.

181
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:51,189
You sure do have taste.

182
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:55,312
That's the second brightest star, Procyon.

183
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,248
I'll allow it.

184
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:01,821
You're always so outgoing and obnoxious.

185
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:04,453
- It suits you perfectly.
- What?

186
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,691
But... How did you get to like stars?

187
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:24,352
When I was little,

188
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:28,300
my Dad sent me a telescope for my birthday.

189
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:31,290
He wrote in the card,

190
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:37,930
"Study the stars well and we'll go look at them together."

191
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,088
So you went around looking at stars with your dad.

192
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,660
No.

193
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:47,229
I never went, not even once.

194
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:49,266
Why not?

195
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:52,150
Believing in that promise,

196
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:56,020
I studied enough to major in Astronomy, but

197
00:23:57,001 --> 00:24:00,340
do you know what I got for Christmas a few years later?

198
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,681
A telescope.

199
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:14,550
It was then that I realized

200
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,560
it wasn't my Father sending those gifts, but his secretary.

201
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,271
Do you know what my dream is?

202
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:33,259
In the future, going to see the stars with your son.

203
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,383
How lame!

204
00:24:36,746 --> 00:24:41,517
My dream is to not make promises that I cannot keep.

205
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,260
Jan Di.

206
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:52,228
I'm sorry for hurting you.

208
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,501

How can you just leave like this?

Sorry!

244

I'm really weak when it comes to saying goodbye.

245
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,649
Even the fierce Ha Jae Kyung has a weak point?

That's right.

00:37:08,797 --> 00:37:14,202
Who said you two, all grown up boy and girl, could be in the same room together with the door closed?

330
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,875
Grandfather, I'm sorry and I'm grateful.

331
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:22,011
I'll spend the night here today.

332
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:24,513
Don't think about running away,

333
00:37:24,513 --> 00:37:26,182
and there's nothing to be grateful for.

334
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:30,766
You're the person that forced me into this house with that kid.

335
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:33,589
I brought you here to punish you.

336
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:34,390
What?

337
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:41,130
Do you know how hard it is for me to walk on eggshells around that grandson of mine?

338
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,334
Grandfather and Sunbae are... and I'm...

339
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:49,538
If you have caused trouble, then you should take the blame for it and accept your punishment.

340
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,510
No, Grandpa...

341
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,021
Jan Di might feel uncomfortable here.

342
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:42,124
It's not you who's uncomfortable?

343
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:50,599
I don't know anything about young people and their feelings being such and such.

344
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,168
I suppose things will happen as fate wills it to.

345
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:56,839
But that child

346
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:00,042
has no place under heaven to go.

347
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:03,512
I want to become a guardian for that child.

348
00:39:05,214 --> 00:39:08,684
There's nothing to like or be uncomfortable about.

349
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:11,620
But for a child like Jan Di

350
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,590
to be paired with someone as stoic as you,

351
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,326
I'm against it, my boy.

352
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,885
When I think about it,

353
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:46,388
that was the first time Eun Jae asked for a favor.

354
00:39:46,388 --> 00:39:50,559
That day, do you know what I was doing?

355
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:55,696
I have a favor to ask.

356
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:57,432
Favor?

Tomorrow morning, at 7 a.m., come here to this place.

358

Don't ask me for a reason.

What is it now?

366
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,051
A farewell trip?

367
00:41:23,886 --> 00:41:26,088
And if I get him for you?

368
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:28,823
What's the use?

369

Mom. Can't you just let him go now?

370
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:39,835
Please.

371
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,637

Please get in.

373
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:53,250
To be honest, I have a favor to ask of you,

374
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,178
Miss Jan Di.

375
00:42:56,178 --> 00:42:58,513
A favor?

376
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:14,296
Whenever you have spare time, as a part-time job,

377
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:18,300
can you come visit this person?

378
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,202
Me?

379
00:43:21,837 --> 00:43:24,539
You can tell him stories

380
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:27,475
or you can just show your face once in a while.

381
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:31,560
Who is this person?

382
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,320
To me, he's like an older brother.

383
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,740
He's the same as family.

384
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:43,826
But why did you ask me to do this?

385
00:43:43,826 --> 00:43:48,626
Because what this person needs the most... is warmth.

386
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:56,493
If I tell you that among the people I've met, you, Jan Di, seem to be the warmest person,

387
00:43:57,273 --> 00:43:59,523
would that be an answer?

388
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:05,280
Of course, you will be adequately compensated.

389
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,248
Oh, no!

390
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:10,512
If it is something I can help with, then of course, I'll do it.

391
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:14,930
This is a personal favor,

Okay. Okay.

Hello. It's nice to meet you. My name is Geum Jan Di.

Though I'm lacking in much, I'll be a good friend to you.

396

401
00:45:41,383 --> 00:45:42,516
Is she okay?

402
00:45:42,516 --> 00:45:45,414
Dr. Yoon took her to his house.

To Ji Hoo's house?

404

Right now, that is the safest place she can be.

419
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:02,997
It's so stressful. Look!

Even my skin is a mess.

421

Don't worry too much. It's nothing big.

422

He's just not allowed to go out.

423
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,198
He destroyed a wedding in front of that important figure.

424

It'd be even weirder if nothing happened.

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:45,180
♫ Can't you love me? ♫

491
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,940
[23 November, 3pm]

492
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,937
I wanted to tell you

493
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:04,137
that

494
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,376
I love you.

495
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,064
I wanted to say it out loud like that.

496
00:55:21,064 --> 00:55:23,053
That is all.

497
00:56:04,763 --> 00:56:07,061
Are you quitting?

498
00:56:07,061 --> 00:56:09,934
Are you really going to run away like this?

499
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:12,064
Do you think that this is what she wants?

500
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:13,358
It doesn't matter anymore.

501
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:15,905
It matters to me.

502
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:19,174
In order to make your heart strong so that it isn't easily broken,

503
00:56:19,174 --> 00:56:25,709
you said it needed to be molded and shaped and burned in a fiery oven to endure that.

504
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:28,404
So that you don't have any regrets. You said that.

505
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:30,763
It was all nonsense.

506
00:56:33,781 --> 00:56:35,822
It's not over yet.

507
00:56:35,822 --> 00:56:37,834
You haven't done everything yet.

508
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:40,123
I can't give up like this.

509
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:43,955
I'm going to make this hand move again.

510
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,610
Please move aside.

511
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:02,185
- I just need to get in.
- Go over there.

512
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,477
Thank you.

513
00:58:03,037 --> 00:58:05,291
Take care.

514
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:10,198
Hey, Ga Eul.

515
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:13,985
What's wrong? Are you okay?

516
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,401
Hey! What are you doing these days?

517
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:22,284
You haven't been sleeping and you've been coming out before the crack of dawn.

518
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:25,571
Tell me. What's wrong?

519
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:30,416
Is it something I can help you with?

520
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:33,091
Don't worry.

521
00:58:33,091 --> 00:58:37,490
I only have a little more to do before it's over.

522
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,550
Gosh.

523
00:58:41,246 --> 00:58:43,060
Are you ready?

524
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,522
- Yeah.
- Okay.

525
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,679
Let's move out.

526
00:58:49,683 --> 00:58:52,956
One. Two. Three.

527
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,337
I'm going out with my friend.

528
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:02,239
Whether you decide to follow or not, do whatever you want.

529
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,977
Then we shall go as well.

530
00:59:16,716 --> 00:59:19,853
Manager Lee, you're ready, right?

531
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:37,530
Catch them! Hey! You almost caused an accident.

532
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,420
Move your cars!

533
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,960
What are you trying to do here?

534
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,880
Just stop here.

535
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,172
Don't worry and do whatever you need. I'll take good care of him.

536
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:49,587
Mom will be right back. Have fun with Noona.

537
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:50,614
Please take care of him.

538
00:59:50,614 --> 00:59:53,290
Say "Bye, Mom." Bye, Mom.

539
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,424
Take care.

540
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:58,295
Let's have fun.

541
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,360
Wait a minute.

542
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,934
Goo Joon Pyo! Are you okay?

543
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:09,673
Right now?

544
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,877
I'm tired.

545
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,807
What is it?

546
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,710
This isn't an 'it', it's a kid.

547
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:50,421
We haven't seen each other in forever, why on earth would you bring a little leech with you?

548
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:53,182
Did you adopt him from somewhere?

549
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,806
Noona, let's go here.

550
01:00:55,806 --> 01:00:58,878
Okay, let's go.

551
01:00:58,878 --> 01:01:01,858
I was wondering why you asked to meet at a zoo.

552
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,961
Is that little leech more important than I am?

553
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:08,292
If you don't want to be a leech yourself, then stop whining and follow me.

554
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:09,933
Let's go.

555
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,405
Let's go together.

556
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:22,650
♫ Shout to the world, "I love you..." ♫

557
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:26,700
♫ "...I love you, be my woman" ♫

558
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,340

562
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:45,510
♫ You are the only one who makes me smile ♫

563
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:49,740
♫ Towards the end of my exhausting life ♫

564
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:53,610
♫ You are the only one who welcomes me ♫

565
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,280
♫ I start another day ♫

566
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,610
♫ I recall your pretty smile ♫

♫ I will be happier than anyone ♫

568
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:07,350
♫ If you are by my side ♫

569
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:11,840
♫ On the sky I promise you ♫

570
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,960
♫ I'll bet my everything to protect you ♫

571
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:21,290
♫ Shout to the world, "I love you..." ♫

572
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:25,210
♫ "...I love you, be my woman" ♫

573
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:28,960
♫ You are blinding. Always you're my star ♫

01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,610
♫ I'll protect you ♫

575
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:37,190
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

576
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,700
♫ Why did you come only now? ♫

577
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:44,110
♫ Feels like I have the whole world ♫

578
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:45,960
♫ Thank you my angel ♫

579
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,140
- It's weird.
- What is?

580
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,520
These days,

581
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:56,030
I feel like I'm right in the middle of the scenes that used to only appear in my dreams.

582
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,160
Are the preparations going well?

583
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,580
What are you planning to do?

584
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,750
We need to take this chance to pull out the roots.

585
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:07,670
It's a good thing that there are things more important than money to that foolish child.

586
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:12,610
I did not raise you to become such a pathetic man.

587
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,840
Thank you.

588
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:20,950
I might be cool, but I'm not a good man.

589
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:26,210
Throw away the prejudice that good girls only look for good men.

590
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:30,620
Is it true? They forced Ga Eul's father to retire all of a sudden?

591
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:34,450
This is all... to get back at Geum Jan Di.

592
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:37,160
♫ Oh my love ♫

593
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,610
♫ I pray for you to give me permission ♫

594
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,540
♫ For you to accept me as your man ♫

595
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,310
♫ I promise you, till the day I die ♫

596
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:51,940
♫ My feelings won't ever change. ♫

597
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,740
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

598
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,560
♫ Baby I will forever with you ♫

599
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:04,780
♫ I will love only you forever ♫
