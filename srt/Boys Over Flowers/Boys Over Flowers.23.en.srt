We worked really hard through the Foundation,

168
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,605
and the hard efforts of a lot of people went into this.

169
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:00,747
Jan Di, take a walk around.

170
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:02,448
Okay.

171
00:17:07,082 --> 00:17:08,624
It's quite something, isn't it?

172
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:10,490
It's so spacious.

173
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,732
Oh! What's that grandpa?

174
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,553
Over there are all meeting rooms.

175
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:17,574
Hold on a second.

176
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,709
Yes, it's me.

177
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:24,070
Hey, is that true?

178
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:27,213
Who would have the nerve?

179
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:31,110
How on earth did this situation come about?

180
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:33,971
No!

181
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:38,150
Whatever happens, we must take care of the Foundation!

182
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,887
No!

183
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,160
Grandpa! Grandpa!

184
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,126
Grandpa!

185
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:48,728
Grandpa! Grandpa!

186
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:51,830
Grandpa, your medicine! The medicine!

187
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,650
Grandpa.

188
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,872
Grandpa...

189
00:17:57,872 --> 00:18:02,141
Sunbae! The hospital, the hospital!

190
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:56,735
He did not want you to know.

191
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:01,632
He said he'd be fine as long as he was careful.

192
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:09,408
Let's go and get Grandfather's things.

193
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:36,039
The preparations are going well, I presume.

194
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,704
Chairwoman,

195
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:43,406
apart from anything else, could you reconsider regarding the Sooam Foundation?

196
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:46,479
You know better than anyone that

197
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:49,284
I'm not doing this out of greed for the silly Foundation.

198
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:54,220
What are you intending to do?

199
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,518
With this chance, I'm going to pull out the roots.

200
00:19:57,518 --> 00:20:02,895
It's so fortunate that that little upstart child values something more than money.

201
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,436
I have a proposition.

202
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:16,408
A proposition?

203
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:18,777
The fact that the marriage didn't happen,

204
00:20:18,777 --> 00:20:21,413
I'm sorry about that.

205
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:23,549
But,

206
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:27,653
it's not like the ties are completely cut with JK Group.

207
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:30,623
I will do my utmost to save it.

208
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:32,291
Trust in me.

209
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:35,294
And so what?

210
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:40,299
Whether you put spies on me or keep me locked up,

211
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,301
I'll take whatever you dish out.

212
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,937
Except.

213
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:45,771
Except...

214
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:47,607
Leave Jan Di

215
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:50,609
alone.

216
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:56,782
If I don't do anything to Geum Jan Di, then is that enough?

217
00:20:57,683 --> 00:20:59,451
Yes.

218
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,920
I'll make that promise.

219
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,825
I won't lift a finger against Geum Jan Di.

220
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:11,227
In return, don't forget what you've said just now.

221
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:13,099
Don't worry.

222
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:55,641
This isn't the time to be moping around.

223
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,911
Granny?

224
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:09,354
Do you still not know your mother?

225
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:12,557
This is not the time for you to feel at ease.

226
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:15,995
When you can't even take care of your own girl,

227
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:20,532
how do you plan on taking care of Shinhwa Group in the future?

228
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:26,639
I did not raise you to be such a pathetic man.

229
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:31,443
Just because a person is born as a male, doesn't mean you're automatically a man.

230
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:35,481
Since you're furious at your defeat, you can't bear to step back,

231
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:38,618
and you're embarrassed about running away,

232
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:44,757
you overcome your weak character over time.

233
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:49,194
That's how you become a real man.

234
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:52,564
Do you understand?

235
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:00,706
Granny!

236
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,278
Thank you.

237
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:30,470
[Yoon Ji Hoo]

238
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:53,985
[Ji Hoo in Kindergarten]

239
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:57,958
[Ji Hoo in elementary school]

240
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:22,148
[Ji Hoo in college]

241
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,724
Ga Eul...

242
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:11,797
Didn't you say your father had tenure of 20 years at his company?

243
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:15,250
It hasn't even been that long since he was promoted to assistant manager.

244
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:24,206
Why did they suddenly force only your dad to resign?

245
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:29,831
Why did they do it?

246
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,883
Seriously?

247
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:51,956
Shinhwa's Group subcontracting company forced Ga Eul's dad to resign, all those things in just one morning?

248
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:54,607
It looks like it.

249
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:59,052
I was wondering why she didn't do anything after the wedding.

250
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:02,022
Then again it seems Ji Hoo has been put into a mess too.

251
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:03,956
Ji Hoo, why?

252
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,687
It seems Chairman Kang is going to take over Ji Hoo's foundation as well.

253
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:08,476
What?

254
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:12,445
The development of the new art center in Song-do has already been postponed.

255
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:14,954
Then...

256
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:16,860
this is all?

257
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,378
Her plan to destroy the one, Geum Jan Di.

258
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:42,883
Grandfather...

259
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:47,237
Jan Di, I'm glad you came.

260
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:48,756
Why?

261
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:51,033
Did you miss me in that short period of time?

262
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,994
You and your delusional thinking!

263
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:58,169
Jan Di, since you're here, why don't you take that boy out of here?

264
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:03,088
He's completely stuck on me and won't move an inch.

265
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:05,539
It's suffocating.

266
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,613
Why aren't you guys getting out of here?

267
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:15,692
On such a beautiful spring day!

268
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:19,906
You young, pathetic things,

269
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,388
get out of here now!

270
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:32,502
Let's go.

271
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:48,676
The development of the new art center has already been postponed.

272
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:50,544
So, this is...

273
00:29:50,544 --> 00:29:54,096
her plan to destroy the one, Geum Jan Di.

274
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:20,508
The desire to protect someone,

275
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:23,010
I never thought it would develop in me.

276
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:28,289
But since I met you,

277
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,951
I've started developing it.

278
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:36,256
Grandfather, the clinic,

279
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:38,633
the Foundation,

280
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,431
and...

281
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,771
you.

282
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:31,980
Now since Grandpa is with Sunbae, I'm really relieved.

283
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,090
Sunbae, you don't know that, right?

284
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,320
But Sunbae, you were always like sunshine to me.

285
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,559
Goodbye, my fireman.

286
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:10,159
A dandelion lives as a dandelion,

287
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,786
while a horseweed lives as a horseweed.

288
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:15,488
A plantain also lives as a plantain.

289
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:21,495
On the harsh grounds, though the plantain that lives on the side of the road can only grow angulated,

290
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:27,051
in the rich soil, it shows a different side and is dignified in its own way.

291
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:33,807
This way, and that way, it does not forget its shape and lives as a perfect plantain.

292
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,177
That's where I learned it.

293
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:41,113
That I too, must live as myself.

294
00:32:51,492 --> 00:32:53,494
Mister,

295
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:58,565
I don't think I can come here anymore.

296
00:33:00,033 --> 00:33:03,370
I wanted to see you get better.

297
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:07,941
There were a lot of books I wanted to read to you.

298
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:12,713
I apologize.

299
00:33:14,348 --> 00:33:16,550
I...

300
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:22,022
can endure hunger,

301
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:27,160
and even being cold, I can endure.

302
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,598
But there is one thing

303
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:35,469
that I can never endure.

304
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:41,475
It's seeing those that I love endure hardship because of me.

305
00:33:43,343 --> 00:33:49,649
It's not something that I can make better by trying harder.

306
00:33:53,153 --> 00:33:55,989
Don't you think it's a little unfair this time?

307
00:33:57,658 --> 00:34:02,362
Mister, I'm not running away.

308
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:04,898
Mister, you know that, right?

309
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:10,837
Even when I'm not here, you have to get better.

310
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:47,140
Chairwoman,

311
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:51,311
Geum Jan Di is here.

312
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,814
She came here quicker than I expected.

313
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:55,615
Let her in.

314
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:31,185
Hello, Miss.

315
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:32,953
- Oh, JanDi!
- Hi!

316
00:35:32,953 --> 00:35:34,688
Has everyone been doing well?

317
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:38,691
But what's going on? Is it okay for you to be here?

318
00:35:38,691 --> 00:35:41,962
It's ok. They won't kill me or bite me!

319
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:44,198
Geum Jan Di! Fighting!

320
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:47,167
We're all on your side!

321
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,406
Hello Sunbaenim.

322
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:59,245
Welcome, Miss Geum Jan Di.

323
00:36:00,013 --> 00:36:01,749
Why are you acting like that?

324
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:04,118
It's me, Geum Jan Di, your apprentice.

325
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:07,687
You're a guest when you come to this house now.

326
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:10,824
But, what brings you here?

327
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:13,526
Ah... Goo Joon Pyo...

328
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:15,562
I mean Master Joon Pyo...

329
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,332
I came to see Goo Joon Pyo.

330
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:22,169
Young Master is in his room.

331
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:23,670
Okay.

332
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,846
Joon Pyo, let's play!

333
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:36,484
Goo Joon Pyo, let's play!

334
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:41,319
Now I'm even hearing Geum Jan Di's voice.

335
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,060
Goo Joon Pyo, let's play!

336
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,730
Goo Joon Pyo, let's play!

337
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,599
Hey, what's going on?

338
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,010
Goo Joon Pyo, let's play.

339
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,260
Goo... Goo Joon Pyo...

340
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,409
Why are you here?

341
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,945
Did that Witch do something again? Is that it?

342
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:09,397
Let's play, Goo Joon Pyo!

343
00:37:09,397 --> 00:37:12,731
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

344
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,997
Goo Joon Pyo, let's go on a picnic.

345
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:16,631
What?

346
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:19,031
Picnic!

347
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,460
♫ In my heart ♫

348
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,860
♫ Perhaps there's only the sunlight that shines you ♫

349
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:40,150
♫ Even pain and wounds are embraced ♫

350
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:47,810
♫ Love you, I think of you now ♫

351
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,400
♫ I close my eyes again ♫

352
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,820
♫ I love you, if I could fill your two eyes ♫

353
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:01,800
♫ I love you, if you show me your smile ♫

354
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,490
♫ Even the starlight there ♫

355
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:11,770
♫ I will bring everything and give it to you ♫

356
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:17,160
♫ Love you, if I could convey these feelings of mine ♫

357
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,180
♫ Love you, if you teach me how that feels ♫

358
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,770
♫ I'll follow all of that ♫

359
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,810
♫ Love you Love you Love you ♫

360
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,320
♫ Forever ♫

361
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:55,154
Is today a special day?

362
00:38:55,154 --> 00:38:56,716
What?

363
00:38:57,422 --> 00:39:00,380
I don't know well, but isn't this what it feels like

364
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,120
to have a birthday party or to win the lottery?

365
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:07,883
Are you that happy?

366
00:39:07,883 --> 00:39:09,290
Yes.

367
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,784
I wish every day was like today.

368
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:16,564
Just think about it. You asked me out on a date.

369
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,319
And we haven't even fought once.

370
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:22,658
You're right.

371
00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:26,690
While we're on the subject, can I ask you for one more favor?

372
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:29,159
What is it?

373
00:39:33,214 --> 00:39:37,670
Why haven't you told me that you like me?

374
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:41,810
I've told you many times.

375
00:39:42,604 --> 00:39:45,730
Do I really need to say it in words?

376
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,575
I want to hear it.

377
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:53,067
What kind of person am I to you?

378
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:00,575
I like you.

379
00:40:02,323 --> 00:40:06,280
No matter how much I've tried not to like you,

380
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:10,180
even though I've tried to erase the feeling, I can't.

381
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,080
It's to the point where I'm just frustrated.

382
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:17,928
Didn't you come because you had something to say?

383
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,659
Leave them alone.

384
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:25,590
- What?
- My friend Ga Eul's family.

385
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,662
Also Ji Hoo Sunbae's Foundation.

386
00:41:28,662 --> 00:41:31,031
Just leave them alone.

387
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,967
What's your offer?

388
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:35,796
What are you going to give me in return?

389
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:39,640
If there's nothing as collateral, I don't have any desire to agree.

390
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,740
I'll leave.

391
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:49,040
I'll leave Goo Joon Pyo.

392
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,488
I'll transfer schools and move.

393
00:41:54,488 --> 00:41:57,592
I'll move to a place Goo Joon Pyo can never find me.

394
00:41:57,592 --> 00:41:59,545
Is that enough?

395
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:04,966
If only you keep that promise.

396
00:42:04,966 --> 00:42:07,116
I'll keep that promise.

397
00:42:08,846 --> 00:42:10,305
Fine.

398
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:13,074
I think we've come to an agreement.

399
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:14,928
I'm not losing to you.

400
00:42:14,928 --> 00:42:17,700
I'm not running away or stealing either.

401
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,390
You are...

402
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:26,120
The most evil person I've ever known.

403
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:32,693
The people that I love,

404
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:36,364
I don't want them entangled with you, so I'm leaving.

405
00:42:36,364 --> 00:42:38,499
From you,

406
00:42:41,303 --> 00:42:44,630
the person I love the most

407
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:49,844
I can't save, and it makes me feel so anxious.

408
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:08,500
Goo Joon Pyo.

409
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:14,034
Stop the car here.

410
00:43:14,034 --> 00:43:15,270
Here?

411
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,864
Why?

412
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:20,090
Just stop the car.

413
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,137
What's up with these bags?

414
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:53,710
Is this a surprise event?

415
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,860
Goo Joon Pyo,

416
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:03,853
I'm not going to see you anymore.

417
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:05,247
What?

418
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,720
Today was my last day with you.

419
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,405
Hey, Geum Jan Di. Are you bothered that we didn't fight once today?

420
00:44:12,405 --> 00:44:14,887
Even if you're going to joke around, what kind of a joke is this?

421
00:44:14,887 --> 00:44:16,906
I'm not joking.

422
00:44:18,718 --> 00:44:20,982
What's your reason?

423
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:22,941
Did the witch do something to you again?

424
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:25,150
No. It was my decision,

425
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,258
to take you out of my life.

426
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:30,452
Geum Jan Di.

427
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:32,441
Thank you for everything.

428
00:44:32,441 --> 00:44:33,996
Take care.

429
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:36,358
What's wrong with you?

430
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:38,370
You said you liked me.

431
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,070
Just a while ago you said yourself that you liked me, so why are you doing this?

432
00:44:45,468 --> 00:44:47,709
It's because of the witch, isn't it?

433
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:48,810
Right?

434
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,512
No.

435
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:52,381
It's because of me.

436
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:53,778
What?

437
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:56,764
This time, I realized

438
00:44:56,764 --> 00:45:00,331
that you and I live in two separate worlds.

439
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,964
Even though we met in a dream-like fate, but

440
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:08,028
now

441
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:11,199
it's time to return to our separate worlds.

442
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:13,100
That's a lie.

443
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,831
You're lying to me right now.

444
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:21,126
Tell me. I'll solve it.

445
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:23,360
I'll protect you!

446
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:39,340
Don't leave!!!

447
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,941
You said you liked me.

448
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,877
Your love is like this?

449
00:45:56,877 --> 00:46:00,416
You said that you liked me and you're going to end it so easily?

450
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:05,100
Maybe it was just this much.

451
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,350
No matter how much I liked you, maybe this is all I could put up with.

452
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:14,062
Just this much.

453
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,130
Maybe it was just that.

454
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,879
Say it.

455
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,580
Aside from Shinhwa and being a plutocrat,

456
00:46:23,326 --> 00:46:25,129
have you ever seen me

457
00:46:26,147 --> 00:46:29,125
as just a guy?

458
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:32,391
No.

459
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:38,259
No matter how much you struggle, you're still Shinhwa Group's Goo Joon Pyo.

460
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,792
I never forgot that, not even for a single moment.

461
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,193
Pull Over!

462
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,311
Jan Di!

463
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:12,721
Geum Jan Di!

464
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:14,523
Jan Di!

465
00:47:16,302 --> 00:47:18,560
I said pull over!

466
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,295
Jan Di!

467
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:29,640
♫ Because of my tears, because I long for you ♫

468
00:47:31,828 --> 00:47:34,440
Jan Di!

469
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,649
Ever since I've liked you, I've always wished

470
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:44,450
that you were a normal guy that had nothing to do

471
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:47,280
with Shinhwa or being a plutocrat.

472
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,710
I'm so sorry Goo Joon Pyo, I couldn't keep my promise.

473
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:55,697
I'm really sorry.

474
00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:00,610
♫ I'll only look at you ♫

475
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:07,950
♫ I can see no one but you ♫

476
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,800
♫ Just for today ♫

477
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,000
♫ I'll only look at you ♫

478
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,910
♫ Tomorrow, I'll forget you ♫

479
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:26,920
♫ I promise ♫

480
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,633
Jan Di!

481
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:07,503
Grandfather is here. Where is she?

482
00:49:07,503 --> 00:49:09,740
Jan Di?

483
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,650
This child!

484
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,622
I'm sorry that I have to leave this way.

485
00:49:26,622 --> 00:49:29,554
Thank you for everything.

486
00:49:29,554 --> 00:49:31,927
I'll never forget how grateful I am.

487
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,470
Both of you, please take care.

488
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:44,987
I'm telling the truth.

489
00:50:44,987 --> 00:50:47,103
Why won't you believe me?

490
00:50:47,103 --> 00:50:49,038
Oh, you're starting again!

491
00:50:49,038 --> 00:50:52,527
If your future son-in-law is some heir to great fortune, what are you doing here?

492
00:50:52,527 --> 00:50:55,944
And not just any heir, Shinhwa Group?!

493
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:59,815
Then my future daughter-in-law is Jun Sul Group's daughter!

494
00:50:59,815 --> 00:51:02,584
My daughter goes to Shinhwa High School.

495
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:05,988
I've even made dinner for Shinhwa Group's heir, Goo Joon Pyo.

496
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:08,701
Why won't you believe a word I say?

497
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:10,658
Fine, all right.

498
00:51:10,658 --> 00:51:15,464
Then why don't you go to your future son-in-law and have him take care of your debts?

499
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:19,763
If you don't, something might happen to you.

500
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,084
Oh, welcome. What can I get you?

501
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:27,940
Give me one of these.

502
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,282
Here you go.

503
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:45,060
Who is that?

504
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,964
He came here kind of in the same situation as you.

505
00:51:47,964 --> 00:51:50,666
He was the president of a startup company...

506
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:53,636
M... M...

507
00:51:53,636 --> 00:51:59,308
However, he lost everything because of some large corporations.

508
00:51:59,308 --> 00:52:04,246
He was divorced and lost his kids, too.

509
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,381
Oh, no. What to do?

510
00:52:05,381 --> 00:52:09,600
Seeing that he's been hanging around here for the past few months,

511
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,780
I think he's hiding from creditors.

512
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,790
That's really too bad.

513
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:19,093
You've got problems of your own. You're in no position to worry about others!

514
00:52:19,093 --> 00:52:20,930
Yes, that's right.

515
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,380
Isn't that Jan Di?

516
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:05,106
Oh, my. Oh, my! Jan Di!

517
00:53:05,106 --> 00:53:07,041
Mom!

518
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:13,882
- What brought you here?
- I wanted to see you.

519
00:53:13,882 --> 00:53:15,818
Is this the daughter that you've been talking about?

520
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,953
Yes, yes. This is her!

521
00:53:18,953 --> 00:53:21,123
Watch this. See this?

522
00:53:21,123 --> 00:53:25,294
See? This is Shinhwa High School uniform!

523
00:53:25,294 --> 00:53:28,250
Oh, my, you said she went to Shinhwa High. She really does go there!

524
00:53:28,863 --> 00:53:31,867
Jan Di, come on. Let's go talk!

525
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:33,836
Why don't you all watch over my little store?

526
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:37,100
Okay, okay, don't worry. Go!

527
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,442
Oh, what kind of luck is that!

528
00:53:40,442 --> 00:53:42,711
Watch it carefully!

529
00:53:42,711 --> 00:53:46,013
How and what brought you here, Jan Di?

530
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:48,983
She looks like she's grown well.

531
00:53:48,983 --> 00:53:50,385
What?

532
00:53:50,385 --> 00:53:52,354
Dad's on a boat?

533
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,156
What were we supposed to do?

534
00:53:54,156 --> 00:53:56,625
Our debt kept growing.

535
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,561
We have to send your brother Kang San, to school.

536
00:53:58,561 --> 00:54:00,763
It seems like we can't even support the three of us.

537
00:54:00,763 --> 00:54:02,365
Why didn't you tell me then?

538
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,466
What good would it have done except to make you worry?

539
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:08,204
I could have quit school, gotten a job. I could have done something.

540
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:10,372
And that's why I didn't say anything

541
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,642
You need to graduate from Shinhwa High and go to Shinhwa University.

542
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:19,248
Get married to Master Joon Pyo or someone so we can survive.

543
00:54:19,248 --> 00:54:21,283
That's our hope.

544
00:54:21,283 --> 00:54:23,418
Mom...

545
00:54:23,418 --> 00:54:25,121
that's rubbish.

546
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:30,492
Wait, you... why aren't you going to school and why'd you suddenly come here?

547
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,471
I came because I missed you guys.

548
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,280
Mom, dad, San.

549
00:54:40,772 --> 00:54:42,880
Honey!

550
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,000
Our daughter, Jan Di, came.

551
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,230
You're doing well right?

552
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,850
Daddy!

553
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:02,222
I came. You're healthy, right?

554
00:55:02,222 --> 00:55:06,000
Please look after your health!

555
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:08,930
Dad!

556
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,079
Dad!

557
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,930
Dad.

558
00:55:23,045 --> 00:55:26,303
Have you heard any news about Jan Di?

559
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:29,822
Well, I've searched just about everywhere.

560
00:55:29,822 --> 00:55:32,119
It's harder to find her than I thought.

561
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:34,362
I wonder where she's hidden herself so well.

562
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:38,424
That Joon Pyo, I don't think he's ever been so unreachable.

563
00:55:38,424 --> 00:55:39,935
He wasn't even this bad in Macao.

564
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:41,324
I know.

565
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:45,516
It's as if he's sitting on a time bomb. It's hard to watch from above or below.

566
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:47,636
The weird thing is, Ji Hoo is the same way.

567
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,805
He's doing well with his grandfather.

568
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:54,810
Do you think Yoon Ji Hoo going to work every day at the Foundation is normal?

569
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,847
For a guy who used to sleep all the time and mess around with his instruments to act like that is...

570
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:01,338
I think it is stranger than how Joon Pyo is acting, and it makes me quite worried.

571
00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:02,514
That is true.

572
00:56:02,514 --> 00:56:04,769
How impressive Geum Jan Di is!

573
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:08,764
To put the great F4 into this state and then disappear.

Yes, Grandfather. It's me.

00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,950
Yes. I'll come get you right now.

♫ Maybe you already know ♫

584
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:28,603
Oh, what should I do?! Our Jan Di has come to visit and the banchan (side dishes) are lacking.

585
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:30,671
What about the ban chan?

586
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:35,109
Just the fact that I'm having a meal with you makes me so happy I could die!

587
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:36,940
Noona, how many days will you be staying before you leave?

588
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,330
It would be nice if you could stay a long time.

589
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,025
I'll be staying a long time.

590
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:44,085
What do you mean you'll be staying a long time? You have to go to school.

591
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,921
Stop worrying about your family and accomplish what you need to do.

592
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:49,691
Kang San's mom.

593
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:51,640
I wonder who it is.

594
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,540
I mean...

595
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,634
We came.

596
00:57:58,634 --> 00:58:00,668
What are you guys doing here?

597
00:58:00,668 --> 00:58:06,741
Oh, she is definitely future daughter-in-law material for a filthy rich family.

598
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:09,440
Only the rich attend Shinhwa High,

599
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,620
so you must have lots of friends who are rich!

600
00:58:12,629 --> 00:58:17,385
Who cares about the friends? She's dating the heir to Shinhwa Group!

601
00:58:17,385 --> 00:58:23,825
Living in the country, I never dreamed that I'd come to know the in-laws of Shinhwa Group!

602
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:26,294
Oh, I know, I know.

603
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,730
Try this.

604
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:32,134
Oh, and the money that you borrowed, just take your time in paying that back.

605
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,554
Oh, really?

606
00:58:33,554 --> 00:58:36,069
Oh, yes. Of course.

607
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:37,829
Oh, and take this.

608
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:39,975
Take this too.

609
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:43,340
Take it. Take it.

My goodness.

611
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:51,830
What's the occasion, this late at night?

612
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:54,180
Take it, just take it.

613
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,490
Eat it.

614
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,000
Okay, we'll eat it well.

Can you really say you like me and end it this easily?

What do you mean send off?

657
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,220
Can you do it?

658
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:02,140
Stop joking around.

659
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,330
- Ji Hoo, give him a kiss.
- Go away!

660
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:08,000
I don't want it!

661
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,170
His face suddenly changed.

662
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,860
You hated it?

663
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,710
Don't stop me.

664
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,390
I'm having a leg cramp!

665
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:25,100
Do you think this makes sense?

666
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,030
- Asking her to be the bridesmaid...
- I'm sorry.

667
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:31,360
He's hitting me.

668
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:40,820
Let's go in.
