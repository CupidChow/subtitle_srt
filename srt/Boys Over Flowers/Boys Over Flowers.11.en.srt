[Episode 11]

7
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:35,120
Excuse me...

8
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:45,980
Excuse me...

9
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,910
Is nobody here?

10
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,685
What exactly is this?

11
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,850
It smells good, right?

12
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,123
It'll be great for her skin.

13
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:16,325
For Geum Jan Di's sake, the pool will become a scented river.

14
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,496
How long are you going to peel all that anyway?

15
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,998
Wouldn't it be better to just fill it with water from a hot spring?

16
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,934
Why didn't I think of that?

17
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:29,005
Should your face really be like that while arranging a touching gift?

18
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,908
It's only because...

19
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:36,112
It's only because this is all I can do for her.

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,416
It pisses me off.

21
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,550
Right!

22
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,210
Nice, nice.

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,010
Nice.

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,052
But, is it okay for you take photos with me dressed like this?

25
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,720
It's okay. It's okay. It's so good,

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,350
very good.

27
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,461
These days, sexy school uniforms like this are the trend.

28
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:30,667
Looking as pure as a high school girl and having a child-like image is so appealing!

29
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,202
What am I going to do?

30
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:36,205
Excuse me, I am a high school girl.

31
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:38,107
Oh, right. High school girl.

32
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:40,577
Ah, you said you go to Shinhwa High School, didn't you?

33
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,614
Isn't that the school the rich go to?

34
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,718
It's undergoing a financial crisis these days.

35
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,820
It's hard lately, isn't it?

36
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,624
Don't worry, financial crisis usually don't hit places like this.

37
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:58,097
Or maybe the more the economy falls into recession, the more this business is booming.

38
00:02:58,097 --> 00:02:59,582
That's true, boss.

39
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:01,144
I know, I know.

40
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:03,099
Yes.

41
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,603
Now, shall we move on to the next cut?

42
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,839
Next cut, ok!

43
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,309
Next cut?

44
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,759
Hey.

45
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,260
I can't wear these.

46
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:36,250
Don't be shy and come out.

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,660
I said they were good.

48
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:42,772
You people, are you sure you're making a leaflet for an institute?

49
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:45,241
What kind of clothes are these?

50
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:48,750
It's not going to work like that.

51
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,117
what are you doing?

52
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:59,021
You've got to finish what you started.

53
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,957
What are you doing?

54
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,052
Are you crazy?

55
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,930
Don't come any closer.

56
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,460
I'll kill you!

57
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,760
You're being a nag.

58
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:15,030
Go away!

59
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,770
I'm a scary person. If you come any closer you're dead.

60
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,590
Save me!

61
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,840
Save me!

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,930
What are you? Who are you?

63
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,720
Ouch!

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
Hurry and let's go.

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,878
Your name is?

66
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:58,948
Not today.

67
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,616
What?

68
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:04,187
You'll see me again soon.

69
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,255
Huh?

70
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:08,538
If we meet again, I'll tell you then.

71
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:11,227
Have a good night, Miss Geum Jan Di.

72
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,496
Good-bye!

73
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:15,665
"Miss Geum Jan Di"?

74
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:17,360
Ah! Excu—

75
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:23,306
"Miss Geum Jan Di"?

76
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,449
Really?

77
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,919
So he knows you, right?

78
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,887
That could be it.

79
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,289
In any event, it's pretty cool.

80
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,110
Hey. To rescue like that, isn't he like a Prince Charming?

81
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,031
Whoa, It's Ha Je! Wow! He's on TV, he's on TV!

82
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,266
Isn't he so cool?

83
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,603
Not long ago he was saying the Prince of Andromeda was the best.

84
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,240
He is not faithful at all.

85
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,408
Ha Je?

86
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,779
Jan Di, you don't know?

87
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,040
He's a new rising model.

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,083
His origin is unknown, his profile is unknown, his daily life is unknown.

89
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,653
He's the definition of a mysterious model.

90
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:15,020
If his face is on a product, it'll sell out the very next day!

91
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,063
Ta-da! Even getting ahold of this product was difficult.

92
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:22,150
Totally awesome isn't it?

93
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,050
So soft and moist!

94
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:36,011
Ah, I'm so hungry!

95
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:39,290
I seem to get hungrier these days without doing anything.

96
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,419
I should go take a nap at the pool.

97
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,297
This is all finished cooking...

98
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:31,730
You shouldn't let it sit here like this.

99
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,200
It'll overcook.

100
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,363
You! You!

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,337
Let me properly greet you, Geum Jan Di Sunbae.

102
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,105
Senior?

103
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,390
I'm Lee Je Ha, a freshman in Shinhwa High School.

104
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:52,447
And, honestly I've been your fan, Sunbae.

105
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:53,316
Fan?

106
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:58,070
You are Shinhwa's Joan of Arc, the commoner's heroine, resisting the forces of F4.

107
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,024
Heh, the commoner's heroine... is too much.

108
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:05,794
By the way, I couldn't recognize you like that.

109
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:07,929
- It's my concept.
- Concept?

110
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,761
Star Concept!

111
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,668
Star?

112
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:16,605
Truthfully, I don't like anybody here. I don't even want to make friends.

113
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:21,277
So I do my best not to be noticed until graduation, that's my goal.

114
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:24,550
Like, a-lonely-loser concept?

115
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,882
- Why are you laughing?
- Because you and I are similar.

116
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,455
Right? I thought so too.

117
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:37,493
I feel like only you and I are from the same world in this school.

118
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,660
The same world?

119
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:50,520
I ate your ramen.

120
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,080
Sunbae, hello!

121
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,948
Hello!

122
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,990
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

123
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,560
- Get lost.
- I'm sorry!

124
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,010
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,030
I'll set you up with a part-time job.

126
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,160
It's to run errands at a magazine and the pay's quite good.

127
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:10,027
It's been hard being able to meet with you.

128
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:12,180
Goo Joon Pyo!

129
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:21,536
- Get in!
- What do you mean by going to Hookkaido to eat crab?

130
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:23,776
Why do we have to go all the way to Japan to eat crab?

131
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:26,879
It's the weekend. We can go look at the snow as well.

132
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,648
If you don't want crab, we can go to Sapporo and have Udon or Ramen.

133
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,151
You want to go to Sapporo for Ramen?

134
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,221
Let's go. I will inform your parents on the way.

135
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:35,538
No, I can't.

136
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:37,289
Why are you always saying you can't?

137
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:39,140
You can. You definitely can.

138
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,290
Why can't you just say yes for once?

139
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,066
I have plans.

140
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,800
What plans do you have?

141
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,303
Today is Ga Eul's birthday.

142
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,438
What?

143
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:56,270
That's why I'm spending the night at her house.

144
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,040
It's a ten-year unbroken tradition, so why don't you just leave it alone this time?!

145
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,080
Am I more important or is Ga Eul more important than me?

146
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,848
Ga Eul.

147
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,010
I will call you.

148
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:20,065
She didn't even look back!

149
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,207
Is this Yi Jung?

150
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:39,544
Ok, I got it.

151
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,450

157
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,215
Congrats! Ga Eul, I heard it's your birthday.

158
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:18,650
What?

159
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,088
Oh, you are here...

160
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,065
You are here, Je Ha...

161
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,150
Oh, you're here.

162
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,196
- Hi Je Ha!
- Hello.

163
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:31,800
- You're here, Je Ha.
- Hello.

164
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,665
You seem to know them all very well.

165
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,801
It's been a long while that's why.

166
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,904
- You're next. Be prepared.
- Yes.

167
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:42,450
Noona, this is the girl I told you about on the phone just now.

168
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,870
Your Sunbae?

169
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,211
Hello.

170
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:48,079
Please come this way.

171
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,490
I'll see you in a bit then.

172
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,540
Don't worry about me, and just go.

173
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,440
It's very messy, isn't it?

174
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,690
Please tidy them up.

175
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,264
Okay.

176
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,801
Then I'll leave it up to you.

177
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,370
♫ In my love, your my heart ♫

178
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,150
♫ In my love, your my heart ♫

179
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,950
♫ In my love, your my heart ♫

180
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,670
♫ Just, baby, come, come, come, come together ♫

181
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,530
♫ I'm looking for you ♫

182
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,402
Wow, it's Ha Je! Ha Je!

183
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:44,644
Wow, you're looking good!

184
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,444
Ha Je, the clothes really look good on you.

185
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:47,932
You have a killer style.

186
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:49,132
You look really good.

187
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,099
He really does look good.

188
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:51,765
Look at him.

189
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:53,332
He looks really good.

190
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:56,279
How do I look?

191
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,160
What's going on?

192
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,995
Are you surprised?

193
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,500
This can't be.

194
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,036
Ha Je, it's time for your shoot now. Come quick.

195
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:20,939
See you later.

196
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,060
♫ To me ♫

197
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:41,190
♫ Love you, many mysterious things fill me ♫

198
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,660
♫ Just by looking at you I smile, what do I do? ♫

199
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,660
♫ Say yes, till the moment when the world ends ♫

200
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,040
♫ I love only you ♫

201
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,110
♫ I'll confess to you as if it's the first time, promise me ♫

202
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,600
♫ To me who had a lot of tears ♫

203
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,120
♫ Can you present me a smile? ♫

204
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,890
♫ Under the same sky, to the couple who loves a lot ♫

205
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,780
♫ We ♫

206
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:28,110
♫ Love you, many mysterious things fill me ♫

207
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:34,180
♫ Just by looking at you I smile, what do I do? ♫

208
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,790
♫ Say yes ♫

209
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,968
Hyung, take a picture of us!

210
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,573
You both look good.

211
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,044
Who is this girl?

212
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,146
My girlfriend.

213
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,652
By any chance, do you want to take part in the shooting?

214
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,488
What?

215
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,889
Me?

216
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:23,830
You know we should shoot photographs for next month's fashion magazine, the "a drama-like, movie-like."

217
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,420
Your partner hasn't been chosen yet.

218
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,602
Hey, I think the atmosphere is just right.

219
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:32,403
Let's do it, Sunbae!

220
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,106
How can I do that kind of stuff?

221
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,045
That much?

222
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,321
Am I okay for the shoot?

223
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:51,856
Yes. Of course!

224
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:15,430
♫ Today, as if it's very normal, you ask how I am ♫

225
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,760
♫ Do you think I'd be fine without you ♫

226
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,850
♫ Blame me for breathing ♫

227
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:39,530
♫ What should I do? I still live in a way that
one word from you breaks my day ♫

228
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,770
♫ Tell me ♫

229
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,170
♫ If it's just me ♫

230
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,440
♫ Tell me if you are also hurting and hurting again all day ♫

231
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,820
♫ Tell me, you and I ♫

232
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,630
♫ Is it too late already? ♫

233
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:11,250
♫ Maybe we might be ♫

234
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,915
Can you understand her?

235
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:27,730
She acts like she had an ancestor who died from dating!

236
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,550
She tries to avoid me whenever I ask her to go out on a date.

237
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,158
Jobs on the weekdays, now her friend's birthday party on the weekend.

238
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:36,061
Doing all sorts of things.

239
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:38,429
Do you know how many part-time jobs she has?

240
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,620
Milk delivery, newspaper delivery...

241
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,100
What is she? She's not even a delivery girl?

242
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,180
I was only trying to make it easier for her.

243
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,680
But apparently her friend's more important than her boyfriend.

244
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,480
The young girl

245
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,870
is now 20.

246
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,570
She's coming close as a lady.

247
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,720
Cosmetics for 20s.

248
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,858
Mmm. It's delicious!

249
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,720
I'm buying, so have as much as you want!

250
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,420
What?

251
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:25,478
I was just thinking that my brother would have liked you.

252
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,480
Do you have an older brother?

253
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,481
Yes.

254
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:34,210
Thinking about it, Sunbae is similar to my brother's ideal type.

255
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,620
I think that's why I want to get to know you better.

256
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,326
Is your brother a college student?

257
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:43,120
No.

258
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:47,800
He's not healthy, so he's in the middle of a break.

259
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,909
You seem to be quite close with your brother.

260
00:21:57,977 --> 00:22:02,313
He's the only family I have.

261
00:22:10,156 --> 00:22:11,791
What's up?

262
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,559
I need to deliver something and I'm late!

263
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,636
Hurry, sit and eat it.

264
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:47,000
A poor lady had an affair with a rich lawyer and babies were born between them.

265
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:50,089
It's just an ordinary story of a family

266
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:55,661
You don't need to look at me so pitifully.

267
00:23:55,661 --> 00:24:00,866
Because of that, I don't live like a snob so I'm thankful for it.

268
00:24:04,303 --> 00:24:06,272
You really were impressed weren't you?

269
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:10,330
Girls always fall for that story.

270
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:21,687
You. What the heck?

271
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,926
That way.

272
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:29,228
That way? Ah, this way?

273
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:32,401
That, that, that way!

274
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,630
That way?

275
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,840
That way?

276
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,620
Hey, wait!

277
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,948
Sunbae!

278
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:51,116
You are Yoon Ji Hoo Sunbae, right? I am—

279
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,052
Are you okay?

280
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:57,020
Yeah.

281
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,370
Joon Pyo came last night.

282
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:04,380
He felt bad that he'd been pushed aside for Ga Eul.

283
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:09,000
That...

284
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,930
Today...

285
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,670
I'll pretend I didn't see you.

286
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,668
- Joon Pyo, you're quiet lately.
- What?

287
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:49,243
You were complaining it was hard for you to see Geum Jan Di and to go on dates.

288
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,778
- I'm going to change my strategy.
- How?

289
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:56,915
I'm being too expensive so it makes her anxious to see me.

290
00:25:57,618 --> 00:26:01,554
Anyone think this will work?

291
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:06,625
Who thinks it won't?

292
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,494
You guys!

293
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,898
What is this you are wearing? It dosen't suit you.

294
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,302
This?

295
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:20,573
It's a bit tacky but somewhat warm.

296
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,043
Joon Pyo, because of you I overdid it with Miss Ga Eul.

297
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:25,844
What did I do?

298
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:31,908
He seems to be really tall.

299
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:33,477
He is so good looking.

300
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:35,210
He's so hot.

301
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,280
He looks so good.

302
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,980
He's really cool!

303
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,910
He has a good body.

304
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,680
He must be tall too.

305
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,210
Not just anybody can be a model.

306
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,350
He looks tall.

307
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:09,922
Isn't she crazy?

308
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:16,060
That stupid girl!

309
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,998
That bitch. Wait and watch.

310
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:20,440
Stupid girl!

311
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,910
How did she get picked?

312
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,737
- I'm getting so angry.
- We, Jin-Sun-Mee, should have been there! Not her!

313
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:28,708
I'm not going to let this go.

314
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:32,820
- Just wait until Geum Jan Di gets here!
- She's bad.

315
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,420
- So annoying!
- Our Ha Je!

316
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,785
Geum Jan Di.

317
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,660
Good to see you.

318
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,992
Geum Jan Di!

319
00:27:46,992 --> 00:27:50,363
Even when we try to let things slide, you go and do things like this!

320
00:27:50,363 --> 00:27:53,700
You haven't had enough? After Joon Pyo, Ji Hoo sunbae it's Ha Je's turn? How can you do this?!

321
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,302
How did a person like you get with Ha Je?

322
00:27:56,302 --> 00:27:58,680
You take F4 from us,

323
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,540
and now you take Ha Je, the last person that gives us hope!

324
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:07,347
How could Ha Je fall for a commoner?!

325
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,498
I don't have any intention of giving you guys hope.

♫ Counting each memory one by one ♫

490
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,770
♫ My heart can't rest for even a moment ♫

491
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:42,320
♫ It will only become a burden that's too much to handle ♫

492
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,670
♫ Why can't I just throw it away? ♫

493
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:51,210
♫ Something must have happened to my heart ♫

494
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,700
♫ I must have become a fool blinded by love ♫

495
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,250
♫ Just one place, everyday one place ♫

496
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:04,650
♫ Looking at the sad light called you ♫

497
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:09,160
♫ I guess even my tear glands are broken now ♫

498
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,690
♫ My tears just don't stop flowing ♫

499
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,730
Before you get jealous,

500
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:19,890
shouldn't you first find out what's going on with your girlfriend?

501
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,110
♫ I love you too much that I'm probably sick now ♫

502
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:31,590
♫ Because I love you too much ♫

503
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:36,700
♫ Just this one thing, just your feelings ♫

504
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:41,120
♫ Can't you share it with me? ♫

505
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:47,740
♫ Can't you love me? ♫

506
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,820
Manager Jeong.

507
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:56,360
Prepare my plane.

508
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,269
Are you feeling better now?

509
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,572
Where am I?

510
00:53:35,572 --> 00:53:37,674
My place.

511
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:39,210
Your... home?

512
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,550
You inhaled a lot of gas and must have gone into shock.

513
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:44,380
You've been asleep since yesterday.

514
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,660
Yesterday?

515
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:53,690
Then I haven't even been home and have been here for two days?

516
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:56,360
I called your house because I figured they'd be concerned.

517
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,228
I told them you went on a trip with friends.

518
00:53:58,228 --> 00:53:59,580
With friends?

519
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:04,530
When I said F4, they weren't worried.

520
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,314
I'll get going now.

521
00:54:17,314 --> 00:54:18,849
Thank you.

522
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:21,151
Do you still trust that person?

523
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:28,658
Even after all of this, are you still heartbroken when you think of Goo Joon Pyo?

524
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,463
He almost killed you! Twice, at that!

525
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:38,269
If he can't have you, he won't be happy until he ruins you. That's the kind of person he is!

526
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:40,620
Don't say another word!

527
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,708
There's something about Goo Joon Pyo that I know and you don't.

528
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:50,014
No, I know. You're the one that doesn't know.

529
00:54:50,014 --> 00:54:51,682
Why are you doing this?

530
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:57,087
Way before you even met him, I've known the kind of person he is.

531
00:54:57,087 --> 00:55:00,280
With the exception of F4, he doesn't see people as people.

532
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,160
He sees the lives and happiness of other people as something as insignificant as an insect.

533
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,990
No,

534
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:10,630
he used to be like that, but not now.

535
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:14,441
That's not all there is to Goo Joon Pyo.

536
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,909
Once you get to know him—

537
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,513
Give up.

538
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:29,419
From the beginning, you and him weren't meant to be.

539
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:32,420
Be with me.

540
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,610
Don't we get along?

541
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:39,930
Sunbae, aren't we of the same world?

542
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,410
We were only friends. You were someone I was really thankful for,

543
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,300
but...

544
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,779
I can't.

545
00:55:55,779 --> 00:55:59,030
No way. Do you still trust him?

546
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,151
After all the things that he's done to you?

547
00:56:01,151 --> 00:56:03,053
I do.

548
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,889
I trust him.

549
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:07,790
Because...

550
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,228
Goo Joon Pyo trusted me.

551
00:56:12,228 --> 00:56:14,497
Because Goo Joon Pyo would trust in me.

552
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,060
You'll regret this.

553
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:34,851
Wake up already!

554
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:37,980
I'm more awake now than I've ever been before.

555
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,530
I know what I did wrong

556
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,460
and what Goo Joon Pyo means to me now.

557
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,698
I'll be leaving now.

558
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:00,870
Je Ha's world, Joon Pyo's world,

559
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:03,310
there's no difference.

560
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:08,510
If they exist in the same place and are surrounded by the same things,

561
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,450
then there's no difference.

562
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,014
I warned you that you'd regret this.

563
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,193
Young Master.

564
00:57:50,193 --> 00:57:52,520
You haven't called.

565
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,360
Your F4 friends have been very worried...

566
00:57:55,362 --> 00:57:56,800
Why should they be worried about me?

567
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,070
It's not about that. It's about Miss Geum Jan Di.

568
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,540
Jan Di? What happened to Jan Di?

569
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,143
I don't know the details.

570
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:11,314
Here is a letter for you.

571
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,022
[If you want to save Geum Jan Di, come alone.]

572
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:27,040
[If you want to save Geum Jan Di, come alone.]

573
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:43,040
Is there a problem?

574
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,740
It's nothing.

575
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,019
Butler Lee, I'm a little tired so I think I'm going to go upstairs and sleep.

576
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:50,854
At this time?

577
00:58:50,854 --> 00:58:53,356
Tell everyone not to bother me.

578
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,360
Why am I so tired?

579
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,563
Joon Pyo came in, right? Is he in his room?

580
00:59:32,563 --> 00:59:35,297
Young master said... Uh, young masters.

581
00:59:35,297 --> 00:59:39,050
Don't worry. Even if he makes a fuss, we'll take care of it.

582
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,405
Joon Pyo. Goo Joon Pyo!

583
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:46,590
- Joon Pyo.
- Joon Pyo, get up!

584
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,740
Are you really going to act like this?

585
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,386
Something is wrong.

586
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,580
Joon Pyo! Joon Pyo!

587
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,240
Joon Pyo!

588
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,665
Guys, over here.

589
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,770
As soon as he came back, there was a weird letter.

590
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,540
Letter?

591
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,340
Guys, go out and check if he's coming.

592
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,787
Your eyes tell me you have a lot to say,

593
01:01:03,787 --> 01:01:05,771
Jan Di Sunbae.

594
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,130
What's your true identity?

595
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,613
Why are you doing this?

596
01:01:30,613 --> 01:01:32,748
I have a reason.

597
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,618
Two reasons.

598
01:01:35,618 --> 01:01:36,853
Two?

599
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:42,439
The incidents at the part-time job, the red card, and the classroom.

600
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:46,028
They were all done by me.

601
01:01:46,028 --> 01:01:48,197
You didn't know they were me, right?

602
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,170
Jan Di Sunbae.

603
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,105
Look closely.

604
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,442
Do I look like someone

605
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,712
you might have seen before?

606
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:20,590
♫ At a time when I missed you so much ♫

607
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:24,840
♫ At a time when it's too hard to hold on ♫

608
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,100
♫ The "I love you" is stuck in my lips ♫

♫ Once again, missing you ♫

611
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,340
- Young master, the chairwoman has...
- I'm not going!

612
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:42,090
Are you really planning on dating our Joon Pyo?

613
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:46,270
I think it is a problem concerning just me and Joon Pyo.

614
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,930
This is me, and you are here inside this.

615
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:55,710
Geum Jan Di is a moon that can't escape from the star Joon Pyo.

616
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:56,650
- Let's go.
- Where?

617
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,110
What do you mean by where?

618
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,250
We need to go ski.

619
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,310
Ga Eul! Ga Eul, be careful!

620
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,570
Ga Eul, are you okay? Wake up.

621
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:08,470
I'm sorry, I was definitely wearing it on my neck...

622
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:10,520
You're always like this.

623
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:15,940
Whenever I approach you genuinely, you treat my feelings lightly.

624
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,560
We're in trouble. Jan Di went to the mountains...

625
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,140
Where is Joon Pyo right now?

626
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:24,370
Young master, it's time for you to get in now.

627
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:29,170
♫ On the days that my chest hurts and it's sad ♫
