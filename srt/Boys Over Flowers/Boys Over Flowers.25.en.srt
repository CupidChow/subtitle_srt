00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,920
Abracadabra...

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,200
Goo Joon Pyo, remember Geum Jan Di, remember Geum Jan Di...

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,250
Abracadabra, abracadabra!

9
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,941
You scared me!

10
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,396
You little brat! What the hell are you doing here?

11
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:22,597
You must've been under a lot of stress lately.

12
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:25,696
You're getting a zit on that good-looking face of yours.

13
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,114
What is this?

14
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:35,069
Can't you see? It's a lunchbox.

15
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,711
Lunchbox?

16
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,650
Is it good??

17
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:27,420
This...

18
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,615
- Did you make this?
- What?

19
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,521
Oh... If it's good, I'll make it for you again!

20
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:42,320
You must be thirsty. Do you want me to go get you some water?

21
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,495
I remember now.

22
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,700
The person that I forgot is you, right?

23
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,250
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

24
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,600
Come back again.

25
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,500
Welcome...

26
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,270
One order of abalone porridge.

27
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,210
And one order of pumpkin porridge.

28
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,408
Sunbae...

29
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,762
Sunbae...
What brings you guys here?

30
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:31,005
Can't you see? We came to eat porridge.

31
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,090
Shall we eat?

32
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:19,060
I'm so full.

33
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,020
Me too.

34
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,540
Now tell us, is there something wrong?

35
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,740
For Geum Jan Di who can't even take care of her boyfriend because of her job...

36
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,000
we brought some news.

37
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,369
Huh?

38
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:36,577
Joon Pyo finally got discharged.

39
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,419
R-Really?

40
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,476
Really?
How can you guys say something so important after you're done eating?

41
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,266
Hurry up and go.

42
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,970
Okay.

43
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,310
Go on.

44
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,217
I'll be back.

45
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,990
I'm leaving too.

46
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,960
Sunbae, you're not going?

47
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,690
No. I came here because of you.

48
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,840
They look happy...

49
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,130
the pottery that's in there.

50
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,330
Instead of suffering from the heat,

51
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,870
they look happy.

52
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,997
Why?

53
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:56,580
Because if they endure it, once they come out, they will be loved.

54
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,270
They hold that hope.

55
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:02,780
That's so like Ga Eul.

56
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:08,010
You can tell me now.

57
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,960
I'm ready.

58
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,023
You have something to say, right?

59
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:21,516
Would you like the bad news first again?

60
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,882
I'm...

61
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,180
leaving.

62
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,880
If you think about it,

63
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,370
that might not be such bad news for you.

64
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,450
Where to?

65
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,180
Sweden.

66
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,960
When... no,

67
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,680
or how long?

68
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,950
Soon.

69
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,200
Probably about four to five years.

70
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,570
That's great.

71
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,890
You'll be an even greater potter.

72
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,810
If you think about it, this can also be good news.

73
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,620
So what's the other news?

74
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,220
When I come back...

75
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,249
you'll be the first one I look for.

76
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,501
Sunbae...

77
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,050
I mean,

78
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,620
that's only if by that time, you still haven't found your soulmate.

79
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,030
Add more firewood!

80
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,810
The pottery has to be 1300 degrees Celsius!

81
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,060
Goo Joon Pyo, congratulations on your discharge...

82
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,150
Oh, it's Jan Di unnie. Hi, Jan Di unnie!

83
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:14,235
Oh, hi. Yoo Mi, you're here too.

84
00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:18,074
What are you doing here? Ji Hoo is not here.

85
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:23,455
I heard that you were discharged. I just wanted to say congratulations.

86
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,252
How nosy you are!

87
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:28,460
Why don't you just take care of your own boyfriend.

88
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,540
Does Ji Hoo know that you're going around like this?

89
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,591
- Hey, watch what you say.
- What?

90
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:36,480
Ji Hoo Sunbae has no reason to hear such things from you.

91
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,390
Then why don't you behave so it's not so embarrassing.

92
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,300
Fine. I shouldn't have come.

93
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,820
You just take care of youself.

94
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:52,603
What's wrong with you, Oppa? You're so mean.

95
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:55,770
Unnie, don't go. They'll bring us some tea soon.

96
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,980
The tea here is really good. Have some before you go.

97
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,690
Tea is ready.

98
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,990
Bring it here, please.

99
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,680
Unnie, come sit over here.

100
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,292
Oh, it looks so good.

101
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,392
- Ah!
- I'll do it myself.

102
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,310
Is it good?

103
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,490
I spilled it all over.

104
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,071
You should try it.

105
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,410
Mmmm, tastes good.

106
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,680
I'm leaving.

107
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,591
You...

108
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,524
don't come back again.

109
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,730
Whenever I see you, my mood turns sour.

110
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,480
You get on my nerves.

111
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,390
I get it.

112
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,260
I'm sorry. I won't come back again!

113
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,280
Unnie!

114
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:59,216
Is the person Joon Pyo oppa has to remember by chance you?

115
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:03,320
I'm right.

116
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,470
But as you can see, seeing you isn't good for him.

117
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,490
Whenever he sees you, his condition worsens.

118
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,380
So, from this moment on, it's best if you don't come here anymore.

119
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,590
But don't worry.

120
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,330
Every chance I get, I'll work really hard to try and get him to remember you.

121
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,330
Take care, then.

122
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,379
- Make me that.
- What?

123
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,300
That lunchbox that you made last time.

124
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,290
Lunchbox?

125
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,680
The rolled eggs that you made for me at the hospital.

126
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,060
Make that for me again.

127
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,057
Ahhh, that. Okay, oppa.

128
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:07,930
But there are so many more tasty foods to eat here.

129
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,360
Why do you want to eat that?

130
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,592
I'm sorry.

131
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,810
Sunbae?

132
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,880
Don't escape.

133
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,526
- Let me go.
- No!

134
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,950
You can't back off now.

135
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,760
Jan Di!

136
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,590
It's all over now. It's useless now...

137
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,770
I believed that even though he lost his memory, even if we had to start all over,

138
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,520
that he'd recognize me.

139
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:28,106
But, the fact is I was wrong.

140
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,290
That's not it.

141
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,450
No.

142
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,010
I may be upset and feel cheated, but I have to accept it.

143
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:39,010
The Goo Joon Pyo that I liked,

144
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:44,090
the Goo Joon Pyo who loved me, doesn't exist anymore.

145
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,030
I told you, you can't become like the little mermaid.

146
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,383
I refuse to accept that you two will break up over something as nonsensical as this.

147
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,575
I can't accept it.

148
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,426
It's not because of Yoo Mi.

149
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:10,860
Ultimately,

150
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,460
Goo Joon Pyo and Geum Jan Di...

151
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:18,170
It's...

152
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,330
It's the end for us.

153
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,765
Try it.

154
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,310
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

155
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,254
- This isn't it.
- Huh?

156
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,210
This isn't the same flavor as before.

157
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:46,060
Did you

158
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
really make that?

159
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,123
Of course. Who else could it be?

160
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:56,228
It's just that each time you make it, it tastes a little different.

161
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,819
Next time, I'll make it just right.

162
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:06,817
Are you upset about something?

163
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,632
That girl...

164
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,660
Jan Di or Japcho ("lawn" or "weed"),

165
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,180
that girl's expression...

166
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,698
I can't erase it from my mind.

167
00:17:25,698 --> 00:17:27,906
I can't erase it from my mind.
You're too much.

How could you?

169
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,360
From the time you were in the hospital until now, I was the one who has been at your side.

170
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,580
But that unnie who pops up every now and then to irritate you gets stuck in your mind?

171
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,571
Your friends treat me like crap and always take that unnie's side.

172

And that unnie's boyfriend treats me as though I have some disease, completely ignoring me.

185
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,780
Report?

186

Oppa still can't remember you.

187
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:14,351
- Is that so?
- And one other thing...

I'm sorry for you,

189

190

What?

191
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:26,550
It's not that I did it on purpose, it just happened.

192

I like him so much that I can't leave him.

I'm going to continue my studies and oppa will carry on with his business.

210
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:08,020
Don't feel too sad while we're gone,

211
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,880
and be happy until we meet again.

212

That girl is something else.

213
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,161
It's a shock to get hit in the back of the head like this.

214

Why would I take something like this?

224

I don't swim.

Don't swim or can't swim?

233
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:10,351
Because of a bad experience when I was a kid, I don't swim. I've never done it.

234
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,040
No.

00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,965
She's here.

331
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,060
Geum Jandi! Why did you come this late?

332
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,283
Oh, well, I...

333
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:36,320
You weren't planning to just skip this last event, were you?

334
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:42,026
We're not even high schoolers, so why do you think we're here?

335
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:48,100
The great F4 have been waiting all day to dance with Geum Jan Di.

336
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:58,530
Miss Jan Di, would you do me the great honor of dancing with me?

337
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,079
- With me?
- Let's go.

338
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,430
No, just a minute...

339
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:38,900
Woo Bin sunbae, who was the backbone and support of F4...

340
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:45,390
I know that you are always one step behind, offering your heart in support.

341
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,590
I know that now.

342
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,070
Although you act cold and mean,

343
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:09,140
in reality, you are warmer and more pure than others.

344
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:14,652
Thanks to you, I think that Ga Eul has experienced a beautiful love.

345
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,930
Don't you think it's time to give others a turn?

346
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,201
Rascal...

347
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,610
Rascal...
What can I do since my clothes are like this?

348
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,400
It's perfect.

349
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,552
Geum Jan Di's combat uniform.

350
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:47,718
Don't you think it's the perfect outfit for Geum Jan Di to finish her high school life?

351
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,311
As if having falling into a wonderland like Alice...

352
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:25,980
It will go to the emergency bell, the possibility which it will meet you there is a fact.

353
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,290
Do you know how comforting it is, Sunbae?

354
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,775
You're like someone sent from heaven to me, like a bonus...

355
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:37,544
I'll never be able to forget you...

356
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:40,969
My soulmate...

357
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:44,902
Ji Hoo Sunbae. Thank you.

358
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,451
What happened to Joon Pyo?

359
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:56,330
His phone is turned off. Do you think something's happened?

360
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,620
Tomorrow...

361
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,750
Got it?

362
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,430
Saturday at 4 pm. In front of Namsan Tower.

363
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,880
I... I'll get going.

364
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,150
You're crazy until the end.

365
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:25,936

♫ I keep smelling a familiar fragrance in the air ♫

367

♫ The breeze that brushed off you ♫

♫ In my heart ♫

370
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,880
Didn't I say that if you were late, you'd be dead?

371
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,060
You're late even on a day like this...

372
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,940
You always just do whatever you want.

♫ Love you, if I could convey these feelings of mine ♫

379
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,337
It's not some kind of magic.

380
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:48,674
This kind of thing is quite easy.

381
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,050
Compared to grassland management.

382
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,060
Come here.

00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,850

00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:19,786
Let's go.

386
00:43:27,623 --> 00:43:29,712
It's been a long time since we've been here.

387
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,964
Is it open??

388
00:43:34,964 --> 00:43:37,800
Why don't I see anyone here??

389
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,412
- I rented the place.
- What?

390
00:43:44,412 --> 00:43:47,090
This place is ours until dawn.

391
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,530
Oh! I also have something to show you.

392
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:58,780
Come here.

393
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,100
I told you there's something I want to show you!

394
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,760
What's wrong with you... there's something I want to show you...

395
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:10,080
You. Do you already know?

396
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,482
You. Do you intend to make it so that I can't get married?

397
00:44:16,482 --> 00:44:20,280
You just need to marry me. Who were you planning to marry?

398
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,550
Move.

399
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,960
Just move aside.

400
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,036
[Goo Joon Pyo loves Geum Jan Di. Our first night together!]

401
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:30,883
It's still here.

402
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,891
You can't get married to anyone else now.

403
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,348
Geum Jan Di.

404
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,279
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

405
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,573
So ominous... What is it now?

406
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:51,250
The two of us...

407
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,397
Let's get married.

408
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,750
Married?

409
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,550
Yes,

410
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,840
married.

411
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:09,818
Why are you making such jokes all of a sudden?

412
00:45:09,818 --> 00:45:11,873
I'm not joking.

413
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:19,880
I've just barely graduated from high school.

414
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,390
I...

415
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,171
have to go to the U.S.

416
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,819
U.S.?

417
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:31,862
This time, it's not because of my mom...

418
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,210
and not because of the business...

419
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:37,160
It was my decision.

420
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:57,227
Driving a father to his death, forcing their children to get married,

421
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,523
or having to lobby all the time. I don't want that kind of corporation.

422
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,480
I'm...

423
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,941
going to try my best.

424
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:14,947
So, if I can save the corporation, then that's great...

425
00:46:14,947 --> 00:46:17,140
But if I can't,

426
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,176
I'll shut it down with my own hands.

427
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,529
How long will it take?

428
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:28,408
How long will that take?
Four years.

429
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,865
It will be at least 4 years.

430
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,730
That long?

431
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:45,573
So... Come with me.

432
00:46:59,254 --> 00:47:00,978
I can't do that.

433
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:09,697
What did you say?

434
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,810
Why can't you?

435
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:18,039
When you went to Macau,

436
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:24,812
I made a decision too.

437
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:29,974
About my dreams and future.

438
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:36,824
What is it that I want and what is it that I want to do.

439
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,927
Like you,

440
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,670
the thing that I want to try my best at doing

441
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,970
is right here.

442
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,770
And?

443
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,576
Have a good trip.

444
00:47:55,576 --> 00:47:57,110
What did you say?

445
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:01,460
I said, "Have a good trip."

446
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:08,110
Four years later, if you come back as a great man,

447
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,680
I will think about it again then.

448

Hey, you are the one who is going to regret it!

452

Alright, you win.

453
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,027
I already know...

454
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:53,367
that I would regret until I die for letting you go.

Dating or love. It seems like you're curious about these aspects of my life.

491
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:57,901
You certainly have a faster understanding of things than others.

492
00:51:57,901 --> 00:51:59,590
Yes.

493
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:04,420
Well, to say I wasn't lonely or had it hard is probably a lie,

494
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:09,020
but because of a promise I made with someone,

495
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,440
I was able to rely on that and endure it.

496
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,670
Just watching you talk about it shows that you have someone special in your heart.

497
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,950
Yes.

498
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:24,930
A lover? Lately, there have been a lot of rumors about your marriage.

499
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:30,070
Since you're already here, how about you tell us a little about who she is?

500
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,750
♫ Oh my love ♫

501
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,270
♫ I pray for you to give me permission ♫

502
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:40,250
♫ For you to accept me as your man ♫

503
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,950
♫ I promise you, till the day I die ♫

504
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,550
♫ My feelings won't ever change. ♫

505
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,390
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

506
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,190
♫ Baby I will forever with you ♫

507
00:52:55,190 --> 00:53:00,360
♫ I will love only you forever ♫

508
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:20,080
♫ Among the people passing by ♫

509
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:26,570
♫ I wanted to find you before anyone else ♫

510
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:34,440
♫ Your eyes and voice that seemed like you were about to cry ♫

511
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,639
- Is that a grape?
- Yes.

512
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:43,083
You're still putting too much pressure in your hands.

513
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:48,031
YiJung Sunbae...
Hi.

514
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:50,033
Hi.

515
00:53:52,114 --> 00:53:55,580
Who is he? Is he the Teacher's boyfriend?

516
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:59,860
Mister, are you from another country?

517
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,988
Oh, how did you know?

518
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:04,404
Oh, how did you know?
Then, did you just come back from Sweden?

519
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:07,063
Little miss, you're really amazing.

520
00:54:07,063 --> 00:54:08,630
Right! That's it!

521
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:14,870
Our teacher said her boyfriend was there.

522
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,080
You can't tell him that!

523
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:47,919
Hey wait! Wait! Wait!

524
00:54:47,919 --> 00:54:50,099
Thank you!

525
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:54,050
Hey, third repeater. Are you late even on a day like today?

526
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:58,460
Not a day goes by that you don't cause trouble...

527
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,510
I'm sorry, Sunbae-nim.

528
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,310
I'm sorry.

529
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:10,790
♫ I'm just blaming the time that has passed ♫

530
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,441
Do you think it'll end like that?

531
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,910
Sunbae!

532
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,500
♫ One more time! ♫

533
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:31,070
♫ Should have loved you more even though it hurt ♫

534
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:40,150
♫ To smile just for you and cry just for you ♫

535
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,970
♫ One more time! ♫

536
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:48,020
♫ Like the hot sun in the sky ♫

537
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,164
- Hey, Geum Jan Di!
- Yes.

538
00:55:49,164 --> 00:55:51,028
Can't you do this properly?

539
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:52,395
- What is this?
- I'm sorry.

540
00:55:52,395 --> 00:55:55,359
- Do it again. Hurry!
- I'm sorry Sunbae.

541
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:02,540
♫ One more time! ♫

542
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:08,100
♫ Oh! my love for you ♫

543
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,800
♫ Oh! One more time! ♫

544
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:17,420
♫ Oh! my love for you ♫

545
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:23,020
♫ One more time! ♫

546
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:26,249
You came?

547
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:38,975
By the look on your face, it seems like you made another mistake.

548
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:44,638
Sunbae, since you entered on time, you're already in the graduating class.

549
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:51,288
When am I, a third-year, ever going to finish and in what millennium will I become a doctor?

550
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:54,750
The future sure looks dark.

551
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,027
You're not worried about flunking?

552
00:56:57,027 --> 00:56:59,063
Sunbae!

553
00:57:01,637 --> 00:57:06,837
It's because of you that I've lasted this long as an outcast.

554
00:57:06,837 --> 00:57:12,309
When I think about what I'm going to do when you go to the hospital, it looks dark.

555
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:16,037
Then, should I stay back one more year?

556
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:17,760
No, it's fine.

557
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,550
That kind of joke is even scarier than flunking the exams.

558
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,619
It's not a joke.

559
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:29,448
Sunbae, you have to hurry and become a doctor so you can reopen your grandfather's clinic.

560
00:57:30,754 --> 00:57:34,390
That's why you went back and studied.

561
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,194
That wasn't the only reason.

562
00:57:37,194 --> 00:57:38,835
What?

563
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:44,674
Doctor Prince, my throat hurts.

564
00:57:46,176 --> 00:57:48,245
Doctor Prince?

565
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:57,821
Sae Byul is going to grow up and marry Doctor Prince later in the future.

566
00:57:59,323 --> 00:58:02,260
We'll get married next time.

567
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,590
Right now, say ‘ah'.

568
00:58:12,368 --> 00:58:14,710
Commoner, can you hear me?

569
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,270
Geum Jan Di, respond.

570
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,950
Are you there, Geum Jan Di?

571
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:21,080
If you're there, come meet me on the beach.

572
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,140
Goo Joon Pyo?

573
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:45,834
Goo Joon Pyo?

574
00:58:57,447 --> 00:59:01,351
You took 5 minutes! Can't you walk faster?!

575
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,399
Goo Joon Pyo.

576
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:19,436
What's going on?

577
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:21,270
What do you mean?

578
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,870
Goo Joon Pyo has come back for Geum Jan Di.

579
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:30,420
Seeing you wearing this white gown,

580
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,850
I guess ugly ducklings can become swans after all.

581
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:38,421
It's Goo Joon Pyo.

582
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:42,726
You're really Goo Joon Pyo.

583
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:54,780
I missed you.

584
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,940
So much I could almost die.

585
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:03,526
I'm not going to let you go again.

586
01:00:09,927 --> 01:00:11,770
You promised, didn't you?

587
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,290
When I returned, you'd take responsibility for me.

588
01:00:16,301 --> 01:00:19,661
Look here, Mr. Goo Joon Pyo with a bad memory.

589
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:24,460
I said when you returned in four years, I would think about it.

590
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,110
I never said I would take responsibility.

591
01:00:29,106 --> 01:00:32,174
Your memory is bad too, but you remember that well.

592
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:35,762
In my memory, there was another condition.

593
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,177
What?

594
01:00:37,177 --> 01:00:42,192
The one about if you come back as a really amazing man.

595
01:00:42,192 --> 01:00:45,640
Can you really say that in front of the great Goo Joon Pyo?

596
01:01:06,578 --> 01:01:08,397
Geum Jan Di.

597
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:13,361
Please marry this great Goo Joon Pyo.

598
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:24,445
I object to that proposal!

599
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,062
I also object!

600
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:28,700
Me too!

601
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,170
You guys can't do that so easily without our permission.
