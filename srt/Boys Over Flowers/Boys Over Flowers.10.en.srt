You came to see me!

You should have dressed like this before.

13
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,628
I didn't recognize you.

00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,500
Shall we go out?

00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:58,637

- For whom?
- Me? Me?

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,515
Just...

00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,951

You should take these too.

43
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:37,693
Why should I give them to him?

44
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:40,240
- Just this one...
- Hey that's...

45
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,728
N... N... Not this one!!

46
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:44,990
- Aw, give it to me.
- Not this one!

47
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,374
The state of this restaurant, it's absolutely terrible.

48
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,577
The philosophy of food, the chef's abyss,

49
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:56,950
I guess this horrible place is a place where things like that don't exist!

50
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,850
Such a rotten place.

51
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,854
Grandpa, our porridge is good.

52
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:05,089
Black bean noodles!

53
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:08,226
Grandpa, this is a porridge shop.

54
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:11,896
If you want black bean noodles, you should go to a Chinese restaurant.

55
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,531
Black bean noodles!

56
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:15,667
Wait, Grandpa!

57
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,871
Grandpa, they are selling black bean noodles over there in Sang Hae Ru.

58
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,773
Please go there.

59
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:24,608
- Ask him to wait.
- What?

60
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:27,210
Black bean noodles is okay.

61
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,040
Let's see.

62
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:46,564
How was it?

63
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:49,801
That was the worst black bean noodles I've ever eaten.

64
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:55,873
How can you sell food with this nonexistent ability to cook, this terrible place...

65
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:59,777
Who said you could order a black bean noodles in a porridge shop?

66
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:04,348
Grandpa, even if it was, you should pay for the black bean noodles.

67
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,317
How much do we have to charge? $3.50?

68
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:12,256
Since it's a special at our porridge shop, 5000 won.

69
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,492
What is this?

70
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,261
For the black bean noodles.

71
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:18,930
Grandpa, we only accept money, how can we accept this?

72
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,360
I'm not giving you money after eating crap like that!

73
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,130
Take it!

74
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,609
Tell the cook or whatever, the next is a Mae Gi Mae Un Tang.
(T/N: Mae Gi Mae Un Tang = hot pepper catfish stew)

75
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,077
- Huh?
- You'll be coming back?

76
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:35,240
You worthless people...

77
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,510

78
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,886

80
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:49,100
How could anyone be like that grandpa?

81
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,970
Master, don't let it bother you.

82
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,090
It seemed like he was suffering from Alzheimer's.

83
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,372
But, can we try some?

84
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,358
Delicious!

85
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,920
It's much better than Sang Hae Ru's.

86
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,176
Are you really going to make spicy catfish stew for him?

87
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,470
Master!

88
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,125
It's Valentine's Day tomorrow.

89
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,428
It would be sad if it just passed by.

90
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:59,530
Who are you going to give it to?

91
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,600
Just someone I'm thankful for.

92
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,475
But, Jan Di, aren't you going to give chocolates to Joon Pyo Sunbae?

93
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:46,711
Chocolates?

94
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:49,947
Chocolate? Yeah right.

95

♫ I don't know myself well either ♫

96

♫ I didn't know I would do this ♫

97
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,260

♫ If you walk past me ♫

101
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,740
♫ If you smile like that again ♫

102
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,000
♫ I can't do anything ♫

103
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:03,354
Why did you want to meet in a place like this?

104
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:06,457
Anyway, you have no sense of choosing a place.

105
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:11,529
I came here with something good planned for a change. Why don't you just follow my lead?

106
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,665
Ah, it's cold. Let's go in somewhere else first.

107
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,633
- Follow me.
- Where?

108
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:20,170
Your're going to take me somewhere weird again and cause trouble, aren't you?

109
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:32,751
Where are you going?

110
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,281
It's fun and warm, and there's tea for free here.

111
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:50,920
It wasn't made for insincere users like you.

112
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,460
It seems the owner lacks customer service,

113
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,850
I can't help but worry for the future of your group.

114
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:04,238
By the way, what is that?

115
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,660
This?

116
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,480
It's nothing.

117
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,120
Give it to me.

118
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,290
This...

119
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,050
I made them to give to someone else... but I ruined them...

120
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,270
They look terrible don't they?

121
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,610
But they taste good.

122
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:36,998
I'm going to eat one.

123
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:41,590
¡Hey! You gave it to me, then it's all mine.

124
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:56,170
Yes everyone's been waiting a long time, this Valentine's Day event is for a free cell phone and will start right now!

125
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,150
All those who want to join the couple hanging on event, please come down right now!

126
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:09,945
Everyone waited and then started rushing down right now.

127
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:14,701
I will give you mobile phones for free.

128
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,740
Ah, the last one team, the last team!

129
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,207
Oh, they are in.

130
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,390
The economy must be really hard.

131

Everyone rushed out as soon as I said "start."

The rule is simple. First, take out your bags, please.

143
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:45,190
Regardless of gender, one should be hanging on the other.

144
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,060
No.4 is already ready.

145
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,441
Yes, so that's it. Now get ready!

146
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,477
I will count to three. One, two, three!

147
00:12:56,477 --> 00:13:00,370
Keep hanging.

148
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,300
Man, you need to bend down more.

149
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,600
You're too stiff, even though you have a lot of waves in your hair. Softly!

150
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,450
Ok, you keep hanging that way.

151
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,840
Yes, there we've got it.

152
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,620
Geez! Is it time for bed already?

153
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,250
No.1 is out! You only held on for 2 seconds, yet your faces are all red.

154
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,930
You may leave.

155
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,950
With one couple already out the real competition will start to heat up.

156
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,400
Wow!

157
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,410
Oh that's good, very good, great!

158
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,000
No? That's it, that's it.

159
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,070
Don't lift your leg already. Lift it when I ask you to.

160
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,620
You guys there, you let go. Come out!

161
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,680
It has finally been 57 minutes.

162
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,820
The last two teams! Who will be the winner?

163
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,130
For how long do you think you will stay?

164
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,170
- I will do my best and stay till the very end.
- Ah, I understand.

165
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,730
For the man, for how long do you think you will?

166
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,510
Until we win.

167
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,070
What? Until you win? Again, please. How long?

168
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,290
- Until we win.
- Wow, that's great.

169
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,610
He's reliable. His girlfriend needs to say a message of support.

170
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:17,930
Oh yes, no need for messages, you're happy with just being held.

171
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:24,190
Hey, laundry! This is really embarrassing....

172
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,130
If they knew the chairman's son was doing this thing, it would make the front page of the newspaper.

173
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,960
Hey, be quiet. It'll exhaust you.

174
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,600
If you need a mobile phone that badly, I'll buy it for you.

175
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,845
The point is to earn it on my own.

176
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,990
On your own? I'm the one doing all the work.

177
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:16,684
For the last time, "sit down and stand up" once.

178
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:22,110
Sit down, and stand up.

179
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,930
Sit down, and stand up. Wow.

180
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:31,364
There are beads of sweat on the men's foreheads.

181
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:35,630
Who will be the last team standing? It's exciting!

182
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,120
Oh she fell! Finally the first place couple has come forth!

183
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,380
I knew they would win from the moment they first entered!

184
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,515
How do you feel?

185
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm so happy!

186
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,510
Yes, congratulations! Everyone why don't you give them a hand?!

187
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,070
Congratulations.

188
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,760
I'm so happy!
-Yes congratulations! Everyone why don't you give them a hand. Congratulations.
Let go! I'll go on my own.

189
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,294
I'll go on my own.

190
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,270
Ga Eul, what brings you here?

191
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,510
The thing is, I was just.

192
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,700
Jung, she must have come to give you chocolates.

193
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,490
Today is Valentine's Day?

194
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,434
Miss, your nose looks red, you must have waited a long time.

195
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,790
Ga Eul, why don't you at least have a cup of tea?

196
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,210
No, it's fine.

197
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,430
Don't be like that, come in.

198
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,940
Wow so many chocolates.

199
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,690
I'll bring the tea.

200
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,040
Leave yours there too.

201
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,148
Excuse me. I'll be going first.

202
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,500
Let me go please.

203
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,690
This is why the nice girls are annoying.

204
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,380
Ga Eul, listen carefully.

205
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,810
What happened yesterday, all of that was just acting. You shouldn't misunderstand.

206
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,210
I'll keep this until you meet the person of your destiny.

207
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,910
Thanks.

208
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,120
Did anyone call a chauffeur service?

209
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,048
How did you know?

210
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:51,585
I told you, I was called as a pick up service.

211
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,553
Huh?

212
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:57,024
Joon Pyo called as he was being dragged away.

213
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:12,906
Thank you.

214
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,573
Well...

215
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:19,310
Geum Jan Di.

216
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:25,048
If anything happens, can you tell me?

217
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,484
Does anything have to happen?

218
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:29,930
I hope not.

219
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,670
I doubt anything will happen.

220
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:42,732
Honestly, it's not like Joon Pyo and I are in a serious relationship.

221
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:45,002
Please drive carefully.

222
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,705
Geum Jan Di.

223
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:52,442
I told you not to worry.

224
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:55,779
Are you going to go in wearing that?

225
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,148
Huh?

226
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:07,957
Ah, I was just about to give it to you.

227
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,200
Here.

228
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,733
Goodbye.

229
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:57,408
Her father is a dry cleaner and her mother works as a cashier at a public bathhouse.

230
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:59,550
Yes, that's right.

231
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:03,760
How did someone like her get into Shinhwa School?

232
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:09,018
You're not making any sense! Who is her supporter?

233
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:11,122
You ordered it, ma'am.

234
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,956
What?

235
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,180
Do you know why public opinion is something to be wary of?

236
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,190
Because it is ignorant.

237
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:22,198
Once it goes berserk, it becomes unmanageable!

238
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:25,235
Reason or common sense don't work anymore.

239
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:30,707
The one who set the fire should extinguish it.

240
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,785
Why didn't you deal with it before?

241
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:45,723
I thought he was tormenting the young lady as he had done before.

242
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:48,525
Young lady? What young lady?

243
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:50,340
I'm sorry, ma'am.

244
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:56,710
Young master wants to see you.

245
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:02,270
That girl, don't mess with her.

246
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:05,574
- What?
- I said don't mess with her.

247
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:08,750
I don't know what you are talking about now.

248
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:14,590
Ah! You're talking about the girl we saw at the event today?

249
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:23,026
Do I look like someone with so much free time in my hands?

250
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:28,660
That much free time isn't available to waste on such worthless matters like that

251
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,000
for the owner of Shinhwa Group!

252
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,970
All right then.

253
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:47,317
Prepare it right away.

254
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:49,252
Yes ma'am.

255
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:41,100
He's like a ghost.

256
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,648
You, where did you get that?

257
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:53,417
Well...

258
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,922
Where could have I gotten it?

259
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:00,790
Hey! Don't eat it!

260
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,506
Ji Hoo,

261
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:20,944
why am I feeling so uneasy?

262
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,350
I feel like

263
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,410
something is going to happen to her.

264
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,559
What I'm most worried about is,

265
00:26:38,428 --> 00:26:41,310
the moment she is in danger,

266
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:45,202
I might not even know.

267
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:09,192
Don't worry.

268
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:13,196
Geum Jan Di isn't that weak.

269
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:15,165
You should know that well.

270
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:19,480
Don't be afraid either.

271
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:22,472
We will always

272
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,243
be there for you.

273
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:42,392
The international hotel chain Lavender's executive director Kang Hee Soo,

274
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:46,196
has been elected as the International Hotel Association's President.

275
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:48,220
Are you satisfied with the results?

276
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:54,102
There is no satisfaction until I become the best.

277
00:27:54,102 --> 00:27:55,572
Who is that person?

278
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:58,541
That person is Joon Pyo hyungnim's mother?

279
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:02,846
Wow, Shinhwa's people sure are different than others. Look, look at that charisma!

280
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:05,214
There's no better female than her!

281
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:08,719
There's no satisfaction until I become the best.

282
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,553
How about that, did it sound like her?

283
00:28:10,553 --> 00:28:13,891
She may become our in-law anyway we can't be faded.

284
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:15,940
- A little bit similar.
- Similar?

285
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,360
Did someone come?

286
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,403
- Joon Pyo hyungnim?
- Young master Joon Pyo? Son-in-Law Joon Pyo?

287
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:22,131
Goo Seo Bang?

288
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,702
Joon Pyo hyungnim?

289
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,843
I've seen her before somewhere.

290
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:39,540
From before, the one who came out on TV.

291
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Right.

292
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,389
Before becoming the best, there is no satisfaction.

293
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:48,425
Oh my! President!

294
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,028
Is someone here?

295
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:10,880
You seem very surprised at my sudden appearance.

296
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,217
Not at all. Young master Joon Pyo...

297
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:19,188
No, I mean we've gotten used to it, thanks to your son.

298
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:21,658
Joon Pyo has been here before?

299
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:25,695
Of course! Not only did he come here, he slept here,

300
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:28,610
made kimchi, went to the bathhouse,

301
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:34,604
I'll just get to the point.

302
00:29:34,604 --> 00:29:38,530
Oh, of course, you're a very busy person.

303
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:43,613
I believe that when people are born,

304
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:48,090
they are born into separate worlds with specific roles they must carry out.

305
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:55,725
Joon Pyo is a child that must carry out, not just Korea or Asia, but the entire world.

306
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:59,129
Of course. The world renowned Shinhwa Group!

307
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:04,634
And I will do everything in my power

308
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:08,305
as his mother, to make sure he fulfills that role.

309
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:11,908
Of course you need to do that.

310
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,745
And in order to raise Jan Di well...

311
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:18,080
Yes my role as a mother,

312
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,780
I will try my hardest to raise Jan Di as a good match to master Joon Pyo.

313
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:25,054
That's not it.

314
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:29,700
Not that, but the grass from the golfing place.

315
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,328
Excuse me?

316
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:36,732
Do you know what is needed to grow good grass?

317
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,335
A fertilizer?

318
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:43,740
It's pulling out the weeds.

319
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:48,678
The most important thing is pulling out from the roots

320
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:54,683
those which do more harm than good to the grass, and which cannot be left together.

321
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,289
By chance do you mean...

322
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:04,594
Are you saying that our Jan Di is a weed?

323
00:31:04,594 --> 00:31:08,931
I'm glad you understand what I'm saying.

324
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:15,939
Typically, they kill the weed with poisonous spray.

325
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:17,941
But this time...

326
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:20,159
Manager Jeong.

327
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,860
Yes.

328
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:33,972
This is 300 million won ($300,000).

329
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,315
If it isn't enough, we can give you more.

330
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:48,319
Since this is also my mistake for neglecting my son.

331
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,940
- Manager Jeong.
- Yes.

332
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,050
[A written promise]

333
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,324
[A written promise]

334
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:06,037
This is a contract that you'll never meet with Joon Pyo again.

335
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:09,107
All you have to do is sign here.

336
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,130
Excuse me...

337
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,210
Honey!

338
00:32:18,082 --> 00:32:20,018
Mom!

339
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:29,250
Leave now!

340
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,899
You're making a big mistake right now.

341
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,836
Whether it's a small or big mistake,

342
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:40,706
I'm a better person than you who calls someone else's child a weed and such right in front of them.

343
00:32:40,706 --> 00:32:43,509
Get out now. Didn't you hear me?!

344
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:45,377
Kang San. What are you doing? Call the police.

345
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:46,712
What are you doing honey?

346
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:48,514
Hurry up and throw them out!

347
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:49,649
Okay.

348
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:52,150
Won't you regret it?

349
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,388
I'm not a generous woman. There won't be another chance.

350
00:32:55,388 --> 00:33:01,225
I don't want to chance running into a woman like you again!

351
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:03,550
Let's go.

352
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:01,419
Mom.

353
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:02,888
Honey!

354
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:05,190
Where did you find that courage?

355
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,256
Mom, I was impressed, really.

356
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,496
I've never been so proud of you.

357
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:16,080
You single handedly showed us that the pride is more important than money.

358
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:19,237
What is he talking about?

359
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:22,707
How can pride be more important than money? Money is the most important.

360
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:26,650
In the world of capitalism, money is the most important thing in whatever you do.

361
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,440
What good is pride?

362
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,840
Honey.

363
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,650
Then, why did you do that?

364
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,887
That woman brings only 300 million won and expects us to be satisfied with that?

365
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,255
Is she making fun of us or something?

366
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:40,892
Every Korean citizen, even three-year-olds, know of Shinhwa Group, and 300 million

367
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,827
is all she brings to offer us?

368
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:43,929
Then?

369
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,132
Forget that. Just marry Joon Pyo.

370
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:50,802
And even though she's alive right now, she's not going to live forever.

371
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:55,741
When she dies all the Shinhwa fortune will be passed down to Joon Pyo. And all of it will belong to you too.

372
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:57,909
What the hell is 300 million dollars?

373
00:34:57,909 --> 00:34:59,177
Mom.

374
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:00,512
What?

375
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:02,348
You should be bold.

376
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:07,753
Our goal is that Shinhwa distribution, Shinhwa aviation, Shinhwa electronics and Shinhwa...

377
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:11,556
cement and car industry and... what was that other thing?

378
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:12,625
Lavender.

379
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:15,594
The hotel too, they will all be yours.

380
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:16,762
Mom!

381
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:21,799
What? Who knows if you're going to be on the news twenty years later?

382
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:26,305
There is no satisfaction before you become the best.

383
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:28,250
Right, right, that.

384
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,740
You sure are my mom.

385
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,150
Honey,

386
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,410
I never knew that you had such a deeper meaning behind this.

387
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,900
As long as you know now, it's ok.

388
00:35:57,168 --> 00:36:00,839
Do you know what is needed to grow good grass?

389
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,243
Pull the weeds.

390
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:07,800
Pulling the roots of the weed

391
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,340
that cannot be with the grass is the most important thing.

392
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:53,230
Do you have a concert ticket?

393
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,655
Why are you here so late?

394
00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:58,460
Then, what about you?

395
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,950
What are you doing here so late?

396
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,065
I don't think I heard that swimming was included in the winter Olympics.

397
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:11,536
I... just...

398
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,471
Feeling frustrated?

399
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:19,176
Since you don't have a ticket, why don't you come up here and flip the pages?

400
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,090
♫ Because I'm stupid ♫

401
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:56,350
♫ I know no one but you ♫

402
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:01,530
♫ But you are looking at someone else ♫

403
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:06,780
♫ You wouldn't know how I feel ♫

404
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:12,040
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

405
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,140
♫ I wouldn't even be in your memory ♫

406
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,400
♫ I still keep looking at you only ♫

407
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,750
♫ My tears keep rolling ♫

408
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,720
♫ Your backside ♫

409
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,980
♫ Looking at that is also a happiness ♫

410
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,280
♫ If you still don't know how I feel ♫

411
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,432
♫ If I stop this and go too ♫

412
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:50,000
I won't take it today.

413
00:39:55,273 --> 00:39:57,075
Why are you looking at me like that?

414
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:59,210
Just because...

415
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:01,713
It's so interesting.

416
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:03,414
What is?

417
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,485
It's that when I ring the emergency bell in my heart,

418
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:10,321
you always show up.

419
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,257
Emergency bell?

420
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:17,461
- Like the one you ring when there's a fire.
- Yes.

421
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:19,450
Then that's what I'll be.

422
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:21,766
What?

423
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:25,002
Geum Jan Di's honorable firefighter.

424
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:29,590
Thank you so much for today.

425
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,700
Go home safely.

426
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,325
Yes, Mom.

427
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:49,694
What's wrong?

428
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,399
Stop crying and speak clearly so I can understand.

429
00:40:57,268 --> 00:40:58,836
What?

430
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:04,376
Why are they suddenly telling us to get rid of the dry cleaners?

431
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:07,620
Well, they said that the landlord's son will get a job with the Shinhwa company if they do!

432
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,540
Well, they said that the landlord's son will get a job with the Shinhwa company if they do!

433
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:17,150
The real estate agent Mr. Yoo said

434
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,820
there's probably no one in this neighborhood that'll rent us anything.

435
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,150
If it's not to her liking...

436
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,687
She should have come here herself and told us.

437
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:32,726
How can she be so cheap and go behind our backs when our lives are on the line?

438
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:36,931
She actually did come around and tell us.

439
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:40,401
But you poured salt on her and kicked her out, Mom.

440
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:44,037
So what? Then what do you want me to do?

441
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:48,442
What is my family going to eat and live off of?

442
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,221
What is this?

443
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:05,693
Today is our first day, so our life depends on how well we do, ok?

444
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:07,561
How are you going to sell them? Start!

445
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:10,098
We sell hot coffees! Coffee!

446
00:42:10,098 --> 00:42:11,440
How about you?

447
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,400
- Squids... squids...
- Shout out loud!

448
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,405
Shout out more casually.

449
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:20,074
Here we have squids!

450
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:21,976
Smile. Smile!

451
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:25,560
Yes, yes! Squids!

452
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,213
- Ah, I want to try.
- Uh, Jan Di.

453
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:30,517
We have pop rices! Pop!

454
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:32,654
We have pop rices! Pop!

455
00:42:32,654 --> 00:42:34,913
- Knock on the drivers' windows and...
- Don't we have to tell them how much it is?

456
00:42:34,913 --> 00:42:36,944
We can just tell when people ask!

457
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:39,163
Come gather. Let's shout fighting and disperse.

458
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:42,530
Fighting!

459
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,242
Disperse!

460
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:45,610
Pop rice! Squid!

461
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,900
Squid! It's only 3000 won!

462
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,220
It only costs 3000 won!

463
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,300
Squid! It's only 3000 won!

464
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,820
Pop rice!

465
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,230
It's only 3000 won!

466
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,520
Pop...

467
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,080
We have pop rice...

468
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,529
Pop...

469
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:16,270
What are you doing mom?

470
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,770
Here's pop rice!

471
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,836
Pop... Pop rice...

472
00:43:22,836 --> 00:43:25,705
Mom, I can't hear a thing!

473
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:27,040
Give it to me!

474
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,877
We have pop rice! Pop, pop, pop!

475
00:43:29,877 --> 00:43:31,711
You try.

476
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,081
We have pop rice. Pop pop pop!

477
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:36,783
- Say it louder!
- C'mon...

478
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,470
We have pop rice! Pop!

479
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,520
Okay, okay.

480
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,910
Pop...

481
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,997
Ahjumma, can I have one pop rice?

482
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,567
Why aren't you giving me the pop rice?

483
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:55,260
Mom! The pop rice.

484
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,571
That will be 2000 won!

485
00:43:57,571 --> 00:43:59,673
Thank you!

486
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:09,890
Pop rice!

487
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,896
Why do I have to go there?

488
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:26,150
Why don't you just go by yourself like you usually do? You shouldn't do things just to annoy people.

489
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,370
Because you're Shinhwa Group's successor, not me.

490
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,774
Why is there so much traffic?

491
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:35,720
Do we have to go this way?

492
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,960
Mr. Jung, why don't we buy some of that?

493
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,270
What?

494
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:45,652
Over there... what's the name of the circle thing on the street?

495
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:49,156
Do you mean pop rice?

496
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,025
Yes that.

497
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:54,161
Are you crazy?

498
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:57,820
The great chairman Mrs. Kang is buying pop rice on the street?

499
00:44:58,798 --> 00:45:00,850
Are you sick or something?

500
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:03,379
Mr. Jung.

501
00:45:03,379 --> 00:45:05,204
Yes, Madam.

502
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:09,677
Excuse me, give us a bag of pop rice.

503
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:11,660
Okay!

504
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,349
It's 2000 won.

505
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:32,950
Thanks a lot!

506
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,720
What should I do with this?

507
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,870
The smell, the dust...

508
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:01,860
I cannot understand how they can sell those things with exhaust gas all around, how stupid.

509
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,964
Put it away.

510
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:05,499
Yes, Ma'am.

511
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,499
Can we have a can of coffee please?!

512
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:20,240
Hey miss!

513
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,420
What are you doing?!

514
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,820
Here's coffee!

515
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,800
Pop rice!

516
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:38,732
2000 won...

517
00:46:48,775 --> 00:46:50,678
Stop the car.

518
00:46:50,678 --> 00:46:52,245
- Just drive.
- Stop the car!

519
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:53,514
There is no need to stop the car.

520
00:46:53,514 --> 00:46:55,849
Stop the car, can't you hear me?!

521
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,133
Goo Joon Pyo!

522
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:15,990
Geum Jan Di, stay still.

523
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,238
Please stay still.

524
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:47,060
I'm proud of you, my daughter.

525
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,960
Claps.

526
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,189
Why didn't you tell me?

527
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:12,160
And if I told you?

528
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:18,531
You'd just say, "How much do you need?" and try to pay for everything.

529
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:21,101
If the landlord wants to shut down the laundry, you can just set up somewhere else.

530
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:23,060
Why embarrassingly—

531
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:30,060
Yeah...

532
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,890
I know my family probably is embarrassing,

533
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,919
- but I'm not sorry for any of it.
- What I meant was...

534
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:44,557
Us dating and my family circumstances are two different things.

535
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,998
Plus, just because you're my boyfriend doesn't mean you can jump in and do everything for me.

536
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:52,699
Then what am I supposed to do?

537
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:57,037
Do I just sit back and watch as your family sells pop rice in the street?

538
00:48:57,037 --> 00:48:58,840
Yes.

539
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,840
That's exactly what you should do.

540
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,376
What?

541
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:06,980
Don't do anything and just watch.

542
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,616
If you want to continue being my boyfriend.

543
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:11,430
Hey, dry cleaner.

544
00:49:13,586 --> 00:49:16,523
You haven't called me that in a while.

545
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:22,162
But what to do?

546
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:25,432
I'm no longer the daughter of a dry cleaner.

547
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:30,960
Geum Jan Di,

548
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:36,674
I'm not trying to scare you and there's no need to be afraid.

549
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,813
Just know this.

550
00:49:41,382 --> 00:49:46,786
We never know what my mom is going to do next. That's just her character.

551
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:51,110
Seemed so.

552
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:57,930
Promise me.

553
00:49:58,698 --> 00:49:59,966
What?

554
00:49:59,966 --> 00:50:04,337
That if anything happens, you'll tell me immediately.

555
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,607
Okay.

556
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:09,300
One more thing.

557
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:16,049
No matter what happens, you won't run away from me.

558
00:50:18,317 --> 00:50:20,954
I can't promise you that.

559
00:50:20,954 --> 00:50:22,422
What?

560
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:29,929
There are so many times I want to run away from you because of you, not your mother.

561
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,930
I'll promise you.

562
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:42,342
At least, I'll promise that your mother won't be the reason for running away.

563
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:49,248
I'm glad you are Geum Jan Di.

564
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:50,350
What?

565
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:55,380
I'm glad that Geum Jan Di, the commoner, the gangster, is my girlfriend.

566
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,530
I am extremely fortunate.

567
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:04,530
That promise makes me feel relieved.

568
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:08,600
What the heck... is that a compliment or a put down?

569
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:19,430
You want to drink this?

[Hiring skilled women]

580
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:21,150
Yes, hello?

581
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:25,320
It says that you're looking to hire night shift part time workers.

582
00:52:27,192 --> 00:52:31,431
Oh, okay. I understand.

583
00:52:44,877 --> 00:52:46,800
Here's the pumpkin porridge.

584
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,710
Okay.

585
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:58,070
The pumpkin porridge you ordered is out. Please enjoy it.

586
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:01,730
Also, it's really hot, so make sure you cool it a bit first before you eat.

587
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,510
You're really on top of things.

588
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,160
Our porridge is really good so please come often.

589
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,780
But, your face (mask) is really cute. College student?

590
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,700
No, I'm a high school student.

591
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,640
Oh, then that might be a bit difficult.

592
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,544
What is?

593
00:53:18,544 --> 00:53:24,640
Our company uses a lot of student models, and I really like your image.

594
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,510
I see.

595
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:34,130
But...

596
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:38,190
how much does it pay?

597
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:41,001
Look at this.

598
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:03,420
What can I get for you? Canned coffee or crackers?

599
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,830
No, honey, you can tell by just looking at them that they came for the dried squid.

600
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:08,820
How many should I get you?

601
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,598
Who said you guys can sell things here without permission?

602
00:54:12,598 --> 00:54:15,480
Guys! Trash the place!

603
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,070
Ah, that!

604
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,010
Move!

605
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,800
You must pay tax.

606
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,286
What the hell is this?!

607
00:54:30,286 --> 00:54:34,282
Who gave you permission? You have to pay tax to be here.

608
00:54:34,282 --> 00:54:36,923
What the hell is this?!
Please stop mister!

609
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:43,077
Do you really think that she would go that far?

610
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:45,229
It still bothers me.

611
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:48,133
Then, you should check it out.

612
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:50,536
- Give me your phone.
- My phone?

613
00:54:50,536 --> 00:54:52,900
Why? Is your phone battery dead?

614
00:55:05,317 --> 00:55:07,186
Hello?

615
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,289
Hello?

616
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:12,392
Yi Jung Sunbae?

617
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:16,540
Yi Jung Sunbae? Hello?

618
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,740
Oh, Miss Ga Eul. Hi.

619
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,760
Yes, yes, yes.

620
00:55:31,378 --> 00:55:35,280
Hello. How much should I put in?

621
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,483
Fill it up.

622
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:39,752
What payment method should I help you with?

623
00:55:43,856 --> 00:55:45,858
Sunbae!

624
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:55,140
Actually, I thought I was going to pass out because I was so tired.

625
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,060
Thank you, Sunbae.

626
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,560
Aren't you overdoing it?

627
00:56:00,766 --> 00:56:02,470
Don't you know who I am?

628
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:07,470
It's me! The commoner representative of the Republic Of Korea, Geum Jan Di!

629
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,285
I'm nothing if you take away my stamina and willpower.

630
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:13,085
- Liar.
- Pardon?

631
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:16,330
Your body is saying that you're lying right now.

632
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:29,090
Wait, I have a lot of tissues...

633
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:38,511
It's heartbreaking.

634
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,722
If I were Jun Pyo, I'd be so upset.

635
00:56:54,794 --> 00:56:57,931
Please don't tell Goo Joon Pyo.

636
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:05,060
I want to take care of my own life.

637
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:08,860
That's the only way I can keep my pride.

638
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,913
I'm so jealous of Joon Pyo.

639
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,580
I'm going.

640
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,719
Hey, Geum Kang San, you don't have lunch money so you're skipping meals, huh?

641
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:53,719
They say "Even Mt. Geum-Gang is happy after eating." What to do? Poor boy!
(T/N: Everything goes better on a full stomach.)

642
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:55,855
Who are they?

643
00:57:55,855 --> 00:57:57,790
Let's go.

644
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,029
Wait, wait, wait! Kang San, are you going around starving?

645
00:58:00,029 --> 00:58:02,100
No.

646
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:05,110
No, wait.

647
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:09,200
Hurry, and tell me the truth, or I'm going to hunt you down at school.

648
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,608
Well, I just told the school that I don't want to eat because I don't want to pay.
