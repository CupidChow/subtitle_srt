It's such a pleasure to finally meet you.

Hello.

Hello.

You must be very happy with such a good son.

I've heard that she's extraordinary. I'm looking forward to seeing her more and more.

00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,194
Please don't anticipate too much.

46

Madam, the preparations are ready.

Then, shall we go?

48
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,230
Shinhwa Group's long-cherished ambition for 2020 is

49
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,422
to build a 2nd Cotai resort district in Incheon, in Korea.

50
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:44,824
It will be the ultimate resort city in Asia, complete with extravagant hotels and additional facilities.

51
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:50,573
In order to complete this project we absolutely need the cooperation of JK,

52
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:53,950
which has achieved many successes in constructing new resorts in cities

53
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,560
such as Las Vegas, Macau and Dubai.

54
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:06,584
If we combine Shinhwa's infrastructure as Korea's No. 1 group and JK's knowledge and skills in the field,

55
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:11,478
this blue print will become a reality much faster and

56
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:14,796
it will create a new history for Korea.

59
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,459

I don't have anything planned.

If Joon Pyo is really pretending not to know me,

It's not a dream.

Did you start that relationship thinking something like this wouldn't happen?

163
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:56,768
I warned you not to be so rash, you cowardly bastard!

164
00:15:57,977 --> 00:16:00,070
What's with you guys?

165
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,530
- Did you guys quit being my friends so you could become a group of Jan Di's protectors?
- Goo Joon Pyo.

166
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,386
If you came here as my friends, then play and go.

167
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:12,729
But if you came to just to talk about Geum Jan Di, then leave immediately.

168
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,780
How is it that you've changed so much?

169
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,500
- 700,000.
- What?

170
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,990
In Shinhwa Corporation,

171
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,540
those families I have to take responsibility for,

172
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,877
are about 700,000.

173
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:42,210
Try having 700,000 families' lives resting on your shoulders.

174
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,280
And see if you don't change.

175
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,670
An invaluable challenge. An unimaginable reality.

176
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,840
Asia's Venice. Shinhwa stands for the legend.

177
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,980
[Shinhwa]

178
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,150
Is Joon Pyo alright?

179
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,003
What's wrong? Did something happen?

180
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:57,393
It's okay. Except for the fact that he's become strange.

181
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:58,830
Hey!

182
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,646
Geum Jan Di has to know too.

183
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:06,430
As you know, a lot of things have happened.

184
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,070
Stress is no joke too.

185
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:14,729
He says he won't see me?

186
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,210
You, how did you?

187
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,120
You knew about it?

188
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:29,270
You don't have to worry too much.

189
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,580
No matter what it is, I came to hear it from Goo Joon Pyo himself.

190
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,730
I have to face it.

191
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,340
You really are Geum Jan Di!

192
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,460
Wow, the night air is so nice.

193
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,316
- Do you remember?
- What?

194
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:51,650
What we used to do here when we were younger?

195
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,660
Here.

196
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,020
Rock, paper, scissors!

197
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,215
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Nice!

198
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:16,410
Ji Hoo, you go that way. Jan Di you go that way, and I'll go this way!

199
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,811
Ten...Nine...Eight...

200
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:33,180
Seven. Six. Five.

201
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,510
Four. Three. Two.

202
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,230
ONE!

203
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm coming to find you guys!

204
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:58,270
Awaiting you in Venice,

205
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,420
The city of Lovers.

206
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,640
As a friend, I have a favor to ask.

207
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,980
Say it.

208
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,510
Just meet with her once.

209
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,950
Why should I do that?

210
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,020
I told you, it's a favor for a friend.

211
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,010
And if I ask why you're asking that?

212
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,979
Because right now, that's all I can do.

213
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,238
I'm going.

214
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,400
♫ Although I ask it to stop, to stop wherever it is ♫

215
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,930
♫ My heart keeps going to you ♫

216
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,310
♫ You don't even listen, or give in ♫

217
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,720
♫ Why is my love like this? ♫

218
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,330
♫ Counting each memory one by one ♫

219
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:35,770
♫ My heart can't rest for even a moment ♫

220
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:40,320
♫ It will only become a burden that's too much to handle ♫

221
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,670
♫ Why can't I just throw it away? ♫

222
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,220
♫ Something must have happened to my heart ♫

223
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,730
♫ I must have become a fool blinded by love ♫

224
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,240
♫ Just one place, everyday one place ♫

225
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,340
♫ Looking at the sad light called you ♫

226
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:10,030
♫ Can't you love me? ♫

227
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,990
What's wrong?

228
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,730
I was just about to go to the airport.

229
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:28,553
I decided to just say farewell here.

230
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:32,171
Before I leave, I have one thing I need to say.

231
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,925
After today, I don't think I'll be able to say it again.

232
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:50,308
I think it's really fortunate I got to know you, Senior.

233
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,578
I'll come back soon.

234
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,200
Sunbae?

235
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,950
Sorry for waking you up.

236
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,310
What's wrong?

237
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,820
There's somewhere we need to go.

238
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,024
Right now, at this time?

239
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:13,141
I've heard of gymnastics at midnight, but a walk at the break of dawn?

240
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:15,000
We're here.

241
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,190
What?

242
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,840
From here, you have to go by yourself.

243
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,210
It should be there on that bridge.

244
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,990
The reason you came here.

245
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,400
Wait...

246
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:31,292
Hi. I came to see you.

247
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:35,950
Yeah. What brings you all the way here?

248
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,921
I was worried after hearing the news about your father.

249
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:47,750
Thanks.

250
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,310
So...

251
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,170
You came all this way for that?

252
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,226
I guess you're getting along well now.

253
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,783
What?

254
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:04,860
As you can see, I'm doing great.

255
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,530
And as you know, I'm very busy.

256
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,730
Now that you know, you can go.

257
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,990
No need to worry about how I'm doing.

258
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,564
What? Do you have anything more left to say?

259
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,824
Really, is this how you feel?

260
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:39,020
What did you expect?

261
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,060
Perhaps "I'm sorry",

262
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:46,270
"Forgive me,"

263
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,550
"I'll be back, so just wait for me".

264
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,970
Were you expecting those words?

265
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,010
Why are you being like this?

266
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,962
I've started to come to terms with reality.

267
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,710
I get it.

268
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,780
Now, I finally get it.

269
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,020
You pretending not to know me, not wanting to see me.

270
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,221
It was all real.

271
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,180
So what I am to you is... I am...

272
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,960
A stain I want to erase.

273
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,013
You're cruel, Goo JoonPyo.

274
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,367
Really cruel.

275
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,360
No.

276
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,030
I was always like this.

277
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,977
I was only pretending I wasn't.

278
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,910
I'm going. Take care.

279
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,040
Just worry about yourself.

280
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,319
Hey pretty girl, are you okay?

281
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:40,148
Excuse me...

282
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:48,358
You are my special lucky lady, because you are my first today.

283
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:51,317
Lucky lady?

284
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,970
Excuse me...

285
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:10,775
Song. Please sing a song for me.

286
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:13,566
No, No. It's my treat.

Young master.

310
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,132
Please leave us alone for a while.

311
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:19,250
Are you satisfied?

312
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,530
Now that you've gotten your way, are you satisfied?

313
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,230
Well, it's not pleasant

314
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,466
that we still have to talk about such an insignificant girl.

315
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,980
She is not just any girl.

316
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,739
She's the first girl that I,

317
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,029
your own son!

318
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,093
ever loved in my entire life.

319
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:52,190
Yes, that's right.

320
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,550
Then what do you plan to do?

321
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,540
You want to abandon everything and run to her?

322
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,710
You want to abandon Shinhwa Group's employees and your future?

323
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,440
Fine.

324
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,201
Have you ever thought about your father?

325
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,130
Stop.

326
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,339
You may have no issue with throwing Shinhwa Group away in a blink,

327
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:20,310
but your father, someone who tried his best for this company until the very end,

328
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:24,529
do you plan on throwing him away, too?

329
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,010
Stop it.

330
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,060
What are you going to do about that Jan Di girl?

331
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,314
Should I make her not be able to live anywhere in Korea?

332
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:34,350
Shut up.

333
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,140
Didn't I tell you to stop?

334
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,090
Jan Di...

335
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,390
Don't mess with her.

336
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,050
If you break your promise,

337
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,530
I'll destroy everything.

338
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:37,772
Can this pretty lady buy an ice cream from me please?

339
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:43,767
I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at Chinese, so...

340
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,412
What did you just say?

341
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:55,461
Ugly girl over there, please buy some ice cream.

342
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:58,901
Do you really think you can sell anything like that?

343
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,708
But you would still buy it, wouldn't you?

344
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,800
How much is it?

345
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,702
Your day?

346
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:12,492
That's the fee for the ice cream. Give me your time today.

347
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,100
♫ Because I'm stupid ♫

348
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,300
♫ I know no one but you ♫

349
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,630
♫ But you are looking at someone else ♫

350
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,210
♫ You wouldn't know how I feel ♫

351
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,090
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

352
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,280
♫ I wouldn't even be in your memory ♫

353
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,590
♫ I still keep looking at you only ♫

354
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,490
♫ My tears keep rolling ♫

355
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,070
♫ Your backside ♫

356
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:13,390
♫ Looking at that is also a happiness ♫

357
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,630
♫ If you still don't know how I feel ♫

358
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:23,150
♫ If I stop this and go too ♫

359
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,190
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

360
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,400
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

361
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,730
♫ "I love you" plays on my mouth ♫

362
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,980
♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

363
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,230
♫ Alone again, missing for you ♫

364
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:50,660
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

365
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:55,982
Jan Di must be doing well, right?

366
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:59,520
Don't worry. No news is good news.

367
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,690
As soon as she meets Joon Pyo, she'll be dying of happiness.

368
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:06,557
Kang San.

369
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:10,288
If your stomach hurts, hurry up and go to the bathroom. Don't hold it in.

370
00:40:13,763 --> 00:40:16,061
Kang San, what's wrong? Kang San.

371
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:18,090
Kang San, where does it hurt?

372
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,780
- Kang San!
- What's wrong?

373
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,851
- Why is he like this?
- Oh gosh!

374
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:24,697
- This is strange.
- Kang San! Look here!

375
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:26,910
Put him on my back.

376
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,090
Kang San!

377
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,707
- She eats well, right?
- Yes.

378
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:34,563
- She's sleeping well?
- Yes.

379
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:43,798
Your blood pressure is good.

380
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:50,308
- Hye Na.
- Yes.

381
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:53,480
Should I give you candy?

382
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,910
Alright.

383
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,500
You're so pretty. Handshake.

384
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,052
See you later.

385
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:01,873
Yes.

386
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,881
Good bye. Thank you.

387
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:43,859
Doctor!

388
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:45,230
Is there anyone here?

389
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,290
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

390
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,050
- Is there a doctor here?
- Please save my son!

391
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:52,736
Something's very wrong. Please look at him!

392
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,550
♫ I know I shouldn't feel this way ♫

393
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:07,060
♫ A lie... If I said it was a lie ♫

394
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:09,000
This is nice.

395
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,190
♫ Tears are falling ♫

396
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,980
♫ I can't look at you because I feel sorry ♫

397
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,090
♫ My heart aches ♫

398
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,760
♫ What should my first words be? ♫

399
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,920
♫ I can't think ♫

400
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,710
♫ You keep ♫

401
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:35,650
♫ making me have bad feelings ♫

402
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:41,120
♫ Forgetting you isn't a good feeling for me ♫

403
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,010
♫ It's a very bad feeling ♫

404
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:49,500
♫ It's a bad feeling, it's a bad feeling ♫

405
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:54,288
It's time. Let's go.

406
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:58,736
That's mine.

407
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,334
I selected this first!

408
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:02,472
I saw this first!

409
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:04,783
It'd be better if you'd let go now.

410
00:44:04,783 --> 00:44:07,766
- I can't let go!
- I said let go!

411
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:11,301
Miss, I'm sorry.

412
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:18,266
I'm very sorry, but, can you just give in this once?

413
00:44:18,266 --> 00:44:20,752
Wh-What did you say?

414
00:44:21,383 --> 00:44:23,731
Do you know the size?

415
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:26,912
Size?

416
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:33,620
Hey, wear this for a second.

417
00:44:35,135 --> 00:44:37,850
Hey! Hey! What the heck are you doing?!

418
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,822
Perfect fit.

419
00:44:46,883 --> 00:44:49,714
- Now take them off.
- I don't want to.

420
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:53,524
You're not taking them off?

421
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,583
Come here, come here!

422
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:25,267
Who the heck is he? Is he crazy?

423
00:45:26,517 --> 00:45:28,566
Are you okay?

424
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:31,336
How is it you're just getting here now?!

425
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,469
They had some business so they left first.

426
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:51,585
What are you going to do?

427
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,458
It's time that we went back too.

428
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,834
Let's go on tomorrow morning's plane.

429
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:07,260
What is that girl doing?

430
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,070
Are you talking about Geum Jan Di?

431
00:47:11,217 --> 00:47:14,250
Yi Jung and Woo Bin have already left.

432
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:19,150
Ji Hoo and Geum Jan Di are leaving tomorrow morning.

433
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,927
It looks like she's finally learned her place.

434
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:25,222
Where is Joon Pyo?

435
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:28,699
He's been in the conference room all night.

436
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:33,232
It looks like he's found his place, too.

437
00:47:55,870 --> 00:48:01,250
♫ I keep smelling a familiar fragrance in the air ♫

438
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,480
♫ The breeze that brushed off you ♫

439
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:14,120
♫ Is passing by me now ♫

440
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,200
♫ In my heart ♫

441
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,560
♫ Perhaps there's only the sunlight that shines you ♫

442
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,840
♫ Even pain and wounds are embraced ♫

443
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:35,550
♫ Love you, I think of you now ♫

444
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,160
♫ I close my eyes again ♫

445
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,460
♫ I love you, if I could fill your two eyes ♫

446
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:49,490
♫ I love you, if you show me your smile ♫

447
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:53,190
♫ Even the starlight there ♫

448
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:58,880
♫ I will bring everything and give it to you ♫

449
00:49:06,285 --> 00:49:08,240
Goo Joon Pyo!

450
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,360
Can you hear me?

451
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:19,532
While you've been gone, I've been thinking of you every day.

452
00:49:20,883 --> 00:49:27,008
How is it the only memories I can recall are of the times we fought?

453
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:33,017
But isn't it strange?

454
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:39,299
The only memories I have are of us being angry and fighting, but

455
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:42,547
when I think about you, I can only smile.

456
00:49:51,785 --> 00:49:53,797
Goo Joon Pyo,

457
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,990
you are doing well right?

458
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,158
When are you coming back to fight with me again?

459
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:13,250
Joon Pyo! Let's go together.

460
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,104
Have you seen this plane before?

461
00:50:15,104 --> 00:50:16,914
- Isn't it a beauty?
- Yes!

462
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:22,500
See this. This is where the propeller is.

463
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,190
Later, you'll need to fly this.

464
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,560
Take a seat here.

465
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,080
- This is the handle.
- Okay.

466
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,290
Aren't there a lot of buttons?

467
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:37,700
When you learn how to fly a plane, you must fly this one.

468
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,450
- Who are you?
- I'm Goo Joon Pyo.

469
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:44,435
- Joon Pyo is?
- Of course I am Dad's son!

470
00:50:44,435 --> 00:50:48,685
What will you do when dad is not here?

471
00:50:48,685 --> 00:50:53,627
I must take care of Mom, Sister and Shinhwa Group!

472
00:50:53,627 --> 00:50:55,583
Goo Joon Pyo!

473
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:58,406
Can you promise me, man to man?

474
00:50:58,406 --> 00:51:00,483
Yes, sir!

475
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:03,487
I promise!

476
00:51:42,253 --> 00:51:45,201
Ji Hoo, Yoon Ji Hoo!

477
00:51:51,283 --> 00:51:55,505
- Min!
- Ji Hoo! What brings you here? When did you come?

478
00:51:55,505 --> 00:51:58,117
Um, I came a few days ago. It's been a really long time.

479
00:51:58,117 --> 00:52:01,292
Why didn't you tell me you were coming to Macau?

480
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,700
I missed you so much.

481
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,389
How long are you staying?

482
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,979
- We're about to go.
- You can't!

483
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:11,260
You can't. I can't let you go like this.

484
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,643
Ji Hoo, let's go to my house!

485
00:52:13,643 --> 00:52:16,639
I can't. I'm with company, so...

486
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,380
Who... It can't be.

487
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,217
She isn't Ji Hoo's girlfriend, is she?

488
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,236
What if she says yes, will you stay?

489
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:52,263
I'm J iHoo's friend. We went to the same school.

490
00:52:52,263 --> 00:52:56,325
Oh, really? Nice to meet you.

491
00:52:56,997 --> 00:52:59,610
I'm really sick, right now.

492
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,370
It's very serious.

493
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:04,480
So, grant me this one favor.

494
00:53:05,797 --> 00:53:09,790
Let's go to my house. Just one day.

495
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:14,311
Uh? Eh? Well, Yeah , okay.

496
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,803
Let's go!

497
00:53:27,063 --> 00:53:31,112
It's no big deal to leave one day later, right?

498
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,410
Oh right.

499
00:53:41,196 --> 00:53:44,650
It's really been a long time, right?

500
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,460
Let's go!

501
00:54:20,588 --> 00:54:22,200
Oh, it looks delicious.

502
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,380
I cook so well, eh?

503
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,123
You even know how to say things like that?

504
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:30,289
You speak Korean really well.

505
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:33,126
Ji Hoo is Korean.

506
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:38,198
Did you learn Korean because of Ji Hoo sunbae?

507
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,974
No!

508
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,779
This is only for Ji Hoo's use.

509
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:35,875
It looks delicious.

510
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,922
Let's enjoy our meal.

511
00:56:07,734 --> 00:56:10,062
Ji Hoo, eat up.

512
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:34,088
(Eat!)

513
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:54,726
That girl isn't pretty.

514
00:57:55,742 --> 00:57:59,476
She's short, and she doesn't have any bosom.

515
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:03,634
And she eats way too much.

516
00:58:03,634 --> 00:58:06,455
What do you want to hear?

517
00:58:06,455 --> 00:58:11,035
That girl... Ji Hoo, is she your girlfriend?

518
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,583
What do you think?

519
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,831
Ji Hoo, that girl, you like her.

520
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:19,024
What?

521
00:58:19,024 --> 00:58:23,305
Whenever you look at her, you smile.

522
00:58:23,305 --> 00:58:25,255
Like before.

523
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:26,350
Before?

524
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:30,350
Whenever you saw Seo Hyun. Like that.

525
00:58:45,334 --> 00:58:48,908
Find out Geum JanDi's room number.

526
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:55,860
What?

527
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,450
She checked out?

528
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,850
I got it.

529
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:35,136
Young master. It's time for us to leave.

530
00:59:44,563 --> 00:59:47,776
When did Ji Hoo leave?

531
00:59:47,776 --> 00:59:50,949
He is still in Macau.

532
00:59:51,997 --> 00:59:55,735
Is that so? Didn't he check out?

533
00:59:55,735 --> 00:59:59,705
He went with Geum Jan Di to his friend's house.

534
00:59:59,705 --> 01:00:02,804
Friend? Which friend?

535
01:00:02,804 --> 01:00:04,730
Should I find out?

536
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,257
No. Forget it.

537
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,130

♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

580
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:30,410
♫ On the days that I think of you too much ♫

581
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:34,500
♫ On the days that my chest hurts and it's sad ♫

582
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,540
♫ "I miss you" plays on my mouth ♫

583
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:41,370
More! Just a little more!

584
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,670
Alright, let's end it!
