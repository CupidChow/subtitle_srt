00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,100
There's something going on with you, isn't there?

8
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:35,448
You're not sleeping?

9
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:38,229
Don't even think about lying to me.

10
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,626
There's nothing going on.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,900
I want to live here with dad, you and San.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,445
What?

13
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:55,673
Why?

14
00:00:55,673 --> 00:01:00,093
What about Young Master Joon Pyo, school and everything?

15
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:04,700
Didn't I say it before? I have nothing to do with Goo Joon Pyo.

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,070
Are you still thinking about it, even after going through all the humiliation?

17
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,220
So, selling fish, crabs and webfoot octopus in this rural town,

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,880
and smelling of fish is how you want to live?

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,150
What's wrong with that?

20
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,560
We're ruined.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,900

What should we do...

24

There's still no news from Jan Di?

28
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,515
No. I don't know what she's thinking.

29
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,020
She hasn't called.

30
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,990
She just said she went to a fishing village but never said where it is.

31
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,768
She must be doing ok. It's Geum Jan Di we're talking about.

32
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:45,537
You seem to know my friends better than I do.

33
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:49,251
Like I said before, I have some knowledge when it comes to girls.

How is Joon Pyo doing?

35
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:58,781
He's a mess.

Ga Eul...

37
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:09,683
Don't you think it's time we start talking about us?

38
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:23,566
Ga Eul. I...

39
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:26,014
I'll go first.

40
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:31,360
You don't have to feel burdened because of me.

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,570
I already know how you feel.

42
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:40,272
So, from now on, I won't look for you anymore.

Eun Jae teacher said before,

46
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,660
that because she did everything that was within her power, that she has no regrets.

47
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:57,718
Thank you,

48
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:00,966
for giving me the chance to do everything I could.

49
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:06,702
If I hear from Jandi, I will inform you.

What can we do?

52
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:27,170
Mister, I am so afraid that our Joon Pyo might break.

53
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,180
I'm really afraid.

54
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,020
Miss, you can't be like this too.

55
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,859
No.

You see,

57
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,629
I have a really bad feeling about this.

How could you do this?

Can't you see it's already hard without you screaming about it?

What exactly are you talking about?

69
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:06,618
How could you say that dad was dead when he's still alive?!

70
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,858
- You...
- How did I know?

71
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,483
You're wondering about that at a time like this?

72
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,130
I'm asking you.

73
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,692
Leaving Dad buried like that, did you intend to deceive me forever?!

74
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,798
Why did you do that?! Why?!

75
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:26,676
This is what your father would have wanted.

He isn't different from a living corpse.

The head of the famous Shinhwa Group...

81
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,690
I couldn't allow the last memories of him to become like that.

82
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:50,082
My pride wouldn't allow it.

83

Pride...

84
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,420
Now... You're saying you lied to the world and even to your children,

85
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,066
that my living father was dead due to pride?

86
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:08,607
It was for your dad.

I'll explain everything. I...
I asked, what's going on?!

91

When dad is not around, what do you have to do?

Yes, sir!

95

Your father tried his hardest 'til the very end for this group,

96
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,800
which you can throw away any minute.

97

I am really sorry.

This time, it was me who realized

101
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,530
that you and I were from two different worlds.

102
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,041
As much as you try to deny it, you are still Shinhwa Group's Goo Joon Pyo.

Don't be like this. Go and see her once.

What can I do by bringing her back here?

150
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,970
There is nothing that I can promise her...

151
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,730
Promising her that I'd always make her laugh,

152
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,907
that I'd always make her happy, so just trust in me... I've lost the confidence to keep those kinds of promises.

Even I hate it.

157

So how do you think she feels?

00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:47,026
With all that she's had to endure already, I'm sure she really hates it.

It's Geum Jan Di, so the situation can be different.

328
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:11,234
Mom, do you have any idea what your son likes to eat,

329
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:16,806
what he likes to do or what he wants to become?

330
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,212
Jon Pyo,

331
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:24,669
loves rolled up egg and ramen.

332
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:33,185
He especially likes eating fish cakes from street vendors.

333
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,510
He can eat 20 at one sitting.

334
00:35:43,164 --> 00:35:45,228
Move on.

335
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:59,081
I don't know when I started to feel this way. But,

336
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:01,250
I cannot live without you.

337
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,694
Joon Pyo... Joon Pyo!

338
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:10,230
I told you so, didn't I?

339
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,231
If not you, no one else.

340
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:23,410
♫ I don't want to do any of that again, I only get hurt ♫

341
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:29,890
♫ My heart is only damaged and hurting ♫

342
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:37,160
♫ Because of love, something like break up ♫

343
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,980
♫ I didn't know that we would break up ♫

344
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,690
♫ So I couldn't see the break up that was approaching us ♫

345
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:55,270
♫ If it hurts this much ♫

346
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,279
Grandfather...

347
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:08,920
♫ Something like love (if it hurts this much) ♫

348
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,870
♫ If it hurts this much ♫

349
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,752
Ji Hoo...

350
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,719
Grandfather...

351
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,226
Ok... Ok... Ok...

352
00:38:56,058 --> 00:38:57,880
Say it.

353
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,690
Aside from Shinhwa and being a plutocrat,

354
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:05,150
have you ever seen me...

355
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,060
as just a normal guy?

356
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:12,600
No.

357
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:18,182
No matter how much you struggle, you're still Shinhwa Group's Goo Joon Pyo.

358
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:23,912
I never forgot that, not even for a single moment.

359
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:36,237
Goo Joon Pyo.

360
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:40,116
Can you hear me?

361
00:39:43,528 --> 00:39:46,782
I lied to you again.

362
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:52,943
To me, you,

363
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:55,820
no matter what, are Goo Joon Pyo.

364
00:39:57,014 --> 00:40:01,725
Goo Joon Pyo... The idiot who likes this Geum Jan Di.

365
00:40:04,232 --> 00:40:08,254
Jan Di who's not cute, has no money and no status.

366
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:15,224
So wake up. Wake up.

367
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,832
Wake up, Goo Joon Pyo.

368
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,300
Goo Joon Pyo.

369
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,720
Alright.

370
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,810
Oh my gosh.

371
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:56,333
Honey! Honey! Everything's okay, right?

372
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,304
You're healthy, right?

373
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:01,274
Us... we're home!

374
00:41:01,274 --> 00:41:03,130
It's all thanks to you.

375
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,090
You and all your hard work on that boat!

376
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,440
Yes.

377
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,189
Because the landlord felt bad about what happened before, he rented it back to us cheaply!

378
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:14,121
Dad! Once I become a pro gamer,

379
00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:17,290
you don't have to be on the boat, so hurry and come home!

380
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,460
Daddy, daddy, daddy... we're okay, so don't worry about us and just take care of your health, okay?

381
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:23,663
I understand honey.

382
00:41:23,663 --> 00:41:25,731
Come home soon!

383
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,783
Sunbae.

384
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:45,952
Joon Pyo woke up.

385
00:42:11,578 --> 00:42:13,946
Oh, Jan Di. You came.

386
00:42:21,086 --> 00:42:23,623
You just woke up and you look perfectly fine!

387
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:26,792
It definitely isn't like any human's recovery!

388
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:29,896
Yo... my bro... welcome back.

389
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,343
Thank you.

390
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:48,446
- For what?
- For being alive.

391
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:54,220
Did you really think that this Goo Joon Pyo would leave this life like that?

392
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,822
It is definitely Joon Pyo.

393
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:58,190
Look at him, he's saying it was an unnatural death.

394
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:02,529
Jan Di, why are you just standing there?

395
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:05,064
Come here. You were really worried, weren't you?

396
00:43:05,064 --> 00:43:08,033
All the tests came back normal.

397
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:13,874
Thank goodness... Goo Joon Pyo.

398
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:16,309
But who is that dorky-looking girl?

399
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,415
Joon Pyo. You don't remember Geum Jan Di?

400
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:25,852
Don't joke around.

401
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:28,931
Geum Jan Di? What's that?

402
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,440
Goo Joon Pyo...

403
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:37,063
Joon Pyo, then do you remember your friends?

404
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:38,931
Are you joking?

405
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:43,069
Tell me my name.

406
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:44,204
So Yi Jung.

407
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,073
Then me... do you remember me?

408
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:48,774
Psh... Song Woo Bin.

409
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:52,920
Do you really

410
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,410
not know who Geum Jan Di is?

411
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,522
Is she someone I should know?

412
00:44:05,714 --> 00:44:07,927
Ji Hoo, is she your girl?

413
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:35,120
It's partial memory loss.

414
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:42,895
For the patient, anything really stressful before the accident, he's forgotten.

415
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:46,398
But how is it possible that he can't remember just one person?

416
00:44:46,398 --> 00:44:51,371
It's possible that memories regarding her are too painful or just too important.

417
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:53,606
So if he concentrates on it too much,

418
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:57,075
it could be erased selectively.

419
00:44:57,075 --> 00:45:01,212
Then, when might his memories come back?

420
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:03,282
Who knows?

421
00:45:03,282 --> 00:45:06,352
Usually it's about six months. But,

422
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:10,689
there are cases where it never returns.

423
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:38,150
Goo Joon Pyo. Hello.

424
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,255
The weather's totally awesome, isn't it?

425
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:41,654
Do you want to go for a walk?

426
00:45:41,654 --> 00:45:43,294
You.

427
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:47,264
Who do you think you are that you can come in any time you please?

428
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:50,629
Are you interested in me or something?

429
00:45:52,398 --> 00:45:55,680
Aren't you supposed to be Ji Hoo's woman?!

430
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:59,471
I'm not anyone's girl!

431
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:05,072
Well, more than Ji Hoo sunbae's, I'm more... your...

432
00:46:05,072 --> 00:46:06,679
Get lost.

433
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:09,381
Are you hard of hearing or something?

434
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:13,285
I said get out! Girls like you bring me bad luck!

435
00:46:13,285 --> 00:46:15,421
Goo Joon Pyo.

436
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:20,259
Can you go out? I want to rest.

437
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:16,478
Why aren't you coming out?!

438
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:20,574
Come out! I said come out!!

439
00:47:20,574 --> 00:47:23,163
I said come out!!

440
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:35,430
Unnie... here you go!

441
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,920
So don't cry anymore, okay?

442
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:49,905
You've got to hit the vending machine. Only then does it work.

443
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,128
Thank you.

444
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:56,559
It seems like you've been admitted at this hospital for a while.

445
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,260
- What's your name?
- Yoo Mi.

446
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,840
Jang Yoo Mi. A junior at Korea High.

447
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:05,526
I'm Geum Jan Di. Shinhwa High, Senior.

448
00:48:05,526 --> 00:48:07,503
You go to Shinhwa High?

449
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:09,376
Oh, that's just so great!

450
00:48:09,376 --> 00:48:12,035
But who are you here to visit?

451
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:14,860
A friend.

452
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,090
Oh, I see.

453
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:21,961
I broke my leg while skiing.

454
00:48:24,992 --> 00:48:27,760
Want to sit here?

455
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,790
Be careful.

456
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:39,346
Yoo Mi, you have such a vibrant personality.

457
00:48:39,346 --> 00:48:46,198
It's just that I get annoyed with people who are at hospitals and are sad or high strung.

458
00:48:46,198 --> 00:48:48,553
I don't like that.

459
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:53,355
So how should one be towards people like that?

460
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:58,855
For people how have been admitted for a long time and they're a little high strung and sensitive...

461
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:01,272
Just naturally.

462
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,705
Naturally?

463
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:10,379
You over there! Are you ok?

464
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:22,801
Oppa... your condition looks pretty bad. You really shouldn't walk around like that.

465
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:23,886
Oppa?

466
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:25,792
Do you want to ride in a wheelchair?

467
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:27,638
Don't concern yourself.

468
00:49:27,638 --> 00:49:29,637
Then do you do want to borrow my crutches?

469
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:32,423
Oppa, do you know how to use crutches?

470
00:49:32,964 --> 00:49:36,690
Hey, you little brat. Don't act like we know each other and just go away.

471
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,127
Oppa, your personality is pretty bad, isn't it?

472
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:42,215
I'm not a little brat. I'm Yoo Mi. Jang Yoo Mi.

473
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:43,094
What?

474
00:49:43,094 --> 00:49:44,910
You're the oppa that's in that VIP room, aren't you?

475
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:49,533
I don't know what great person you are, but a patient is just another patient.

476
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:53,730
Oh, wait... not quite. At this hospital, Yoo Mi is a sunbae!

477
00:49:54,397 --> 00:49:56,543
If you don't want to break the remaining leg,

478
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:58,854
I'd suggest you lean on me.

479
00:49:59,657 --> 00:50:02,520
No, Yoo Mi! Your leg is injured.

480
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,220
Let me help. Lean on me.

481
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:09,978
You still haven't left?

482
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:28,915
Unnie, I'll see you next time!

483
00:50:44,973 --> 00:50:48,251
So, how about shocking him with something?

484
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:52,168
Or recreating some important event in the past?

485
00:50:53,145 --> 00:50:55,051
Such as?

486
00:50:55,051 --> 00:51:00,793
Of all the incidents with Geum Jan Di, what was the event that had the most impact?

487
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,851
Goo Joon Pyo.

488
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:29,614
What's with this girl?

489
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:40,037
What the hell are you trying to do?!

490
00:51:46,182 --> 00:51:49,167
If you come back to your senses, call me.

491
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,220
What?

492
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,842
Are you some kind of crazy girl?

493
00:51:59,796 --> 00:52:01,172
What kind of woman are you?

494
00:52:01,172 --> 00:52:03,995
Joon Pyo, don't you remember anything?

495
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,513
What the hell am I supposed to remember?!

496
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:10,828
What kind of bad luck is this with this bum-like chick?

497
00:52:16,624 --> 00:52:17,981
Has it been too long ago?

498
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:20,524
No. I think this incident was too weak.

499
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:22,500
Next time, let's try something stronger.

500
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,489
Stronger?

501
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:47,669
Didn't I tell you I was at the limits of my patience?

502
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:56,411
Yah! Who the hell do you think you're messing with?

503
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:59,258
Just because you're Ji Hoo's girlfriend, doesn't mean I'm going to hold back!

504
00:53:00,488 --> 00:53:02,393
Goo Joon Pyo.

505
00:53:03,254 --> 00:53:06,055
I'm warning you. I'm not going to go soft on you!

506
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:08,544
I've warned you!

507
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,819
Hey, Ji Hoo.

508
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:46,962
I don't ever want to see this crazy girl again!

509
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:48,983
Do you hear me?

510
00:54:44,812 --> 00:54:46,622
Don't worry.

511
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:49,909
You're not someone that can be forgotten that easily.

512
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:58,160
Maybe because it was so hard on him that he wanted to forget.

513
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,010
If it were a bond that could be forgotten just because you want to forget,

514
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:06,422
would it have been easier?

515
00:55:10,754 --> 00:55:11,979
No way!

516
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:15,040
Who in the world gets special crutches??

517
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,038
I'm telling you the truth.

518
00:55:17,038 --> 00:55:19,976
Do you really think Goo Joon Pyo will use any old crutches?

519
00:55:19,976 --> 00:55:22,044
Here... you hold it.

520
00:55:22,846 --> 00:55:26,899
Oh, seriously. Why is this thing so light? It doesn't feel like I'm holding anything.

521
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:29,424
This is what's called titanium.

522
00:55:29,424 --> 00:55:32,488
That's really funny, Oppa.

523
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:35,036
Joon Pyo.

524
00:55:35,036 --> 00:55:37,529
Ji Hoo. You were there?

525
00:55:37,529 --> 00:55:39,724
Jan Di unnie.

526
00:55:41,306 --> 00:55:42,998
Hello.

527
00:55:42,998 --> 00:55:45,329
Unnie, did you see Joon Pyo oppa's crutches?

528
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:47,580
They're titanium. Pretty funny, huh?

529
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,250
It's not like he's Iron Man or anything.

530
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:56,359
Jan Di unnie's friend is so handsome.

531
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,514
Hello. I'm Jang Yoo Mi. Nice to meet you.

532
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:12,329
It's cold. Let's go back inside.

533
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:36,040
Actual purchasing power is shown...

534
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,695
Who is it?

535
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:54,660
I have brought pizza.

536
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,501
It would be so great if I could see it through a telescope or something.

537
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,612
Oppa, do you like stars?

538
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:07,366
Stars?

539
00:57:08,747 --> 00:57:12,176
The brightest star in winter...

540
00:57:12,176 --> 00:57:16,116
In other words, like Goo Joon Pyo.

541
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:21,040
Then, I am this star.

542
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,900
This one.

543
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:31,315
Oppa. What's wrong? Are you hurting somewhere?

544
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:36,714
There's something important that I seem to have forgotten.

545
00:57:38,252 --> 00:57:40,267
I can't remember it.

546
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,998
My chest feels so tight that I feel like I'm going to burst.

547
00:57:44,782 --> 00:57:46,362
Don't stress too much over it.

548
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:49,872
If it's important, it will come back eventually.

549
00:57:49,872 --> 00:57:53,955
If it doesn't come back, doesn't it mean that it wasn't really that important to begin with?

550
00:57:53,955 --> 00:57:57,233
If you keep stressing about it, it won't be good for you physically.

551
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:06,876
Yo... What's up? Are you okay?

552
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:08,301
Hello.

553
00:58:08,301 --> 00:58:09,577
We meet again.

554
00:58:09,577 --> 00:58:11,275
We are H.C.

555
00:58:11,275 --> 00:58:12,711
H.C.?

556
00:58:12,711 --> 00:58:14,205
Hospital couple.

557
00:58:14,205 --> 00:58:19,080
All the patients and the nurses basically gave us that official title.

558
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,823
What do you think? Do we suit each other?

559
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:26,006
Joon Pyo, do you still not remember anything?

560
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:28,378
What exactly am I supposed to remember?

561
00:58:28,378 --> 00:58:31,434
Geum Jan Di. You don't remember?

562
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:34,066
Why do you keep talking about Jan Di or something?!

563
00:58:34,066 --> 00:58:37,687
I mean, why should I remember your girl?

564
00:58:37,687 --> 00:58:39,423
Oh, forget it!

565
00:58:39,423 --> 00:58:42,426
I don't know where you met this girl, so unsophisticated.

566
00:58:42,426 --> 00:58:45,061
What does she think she is, a gang member or something?

567
00:58:45,061 --> 00:58:46,964
Just make sure she doesn't come in and out of my hospital room.

568
00:58:46,964 --> 00:58:49,103
Goo Joon Pyo!

569
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:52,435
Please stop.

570
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,124
What is wrong with him?

571
00:59:37,915 --> 00:59:39,849
Sunbae.

572
00:59:51,862 --> 00:59:53,963
I'll bring tea.

573
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:57,266
I'm sorry.

574
01:00:02,672 --> 01:00:05,375
Why should you be sorry?

575
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:07,977
I'm the one who is sorry.

576
01:00:07,977 --> 01:00:10,680
I got so mad without even my knowing.

577
01:00:13,718 --> 01:00:17,011
I didn't stop you because I thought Joon Pyo would be hurt.

578
01:00:17,011 --> 01:00:21,173
If you hit him, I thought you would be hurt more, emotionally.

579
01:00:21,173 --> 01:00:23,837
That's why I stopped you.

580
01:00:29,024 --> 01:00:31,378
How long did you wait outside?

581
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,794
Why are your hands so cold?

582
01:00:37,164 --> 01:00:39,218
Let me see.

583
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:48,969
The one that's cold is your heart.

584
01:00:51,196 --> 01:00:54,431
You don't have to pretend to be strong in front of me.

585
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,058
I'm not pretending to be strong.

586
01:01:03,423 --> 01:01:05,837
It's because you're here.

587
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:10,213
You being here gives me strength.

588
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,748
I'll go make tea.

589
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:48,470
♫ Although I ask it to stop, to stop wherever it is ♫

590
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:52,930
♫ My heart keeps going to you ♫

591
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:57,420
♫ You don't even listen, or give in ♫

592
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,780
♫ Why is my love like this? ♫

593
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:05,430
♫ Counting each memory one by one ♫

594
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:11,619
Abracadabra, Goo Joon Pyo, remember Geum Jan Di.

595
01:02:11,619 --> 01:02:13,269
I remember.

596
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:15,980
The thing I forgot is...

597
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,860
you, right?

598
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,000
It's all over now.

599
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,177
That in this ridiculous way, you guys are ending?

600
01:02:24,177 --> 01:02:25,249
I can't go along with it.

601
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:29,370
That girl's facial expression... I can't seem to erase...

602
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:33,898
In the end... Geum Jan Di and Goo Joon Pyo...

603
01:02:35,443 --> 01:02:37,258
only amounted to this.

604
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:40,136
This is all it amounted to.

605
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:48,247
We have gathered you all here to announce something special.

606
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:55,513
Goo Joon Pyo and Jang Yoo Mi, have decided to go study in the US next month.

607
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:04,620
♫ No matter how much I strech my hands out, how much I call you ♫

608
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:09,200
♫ You are only far away from me ♫

609
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,660
♫ This love will only become a painful wound ♫

610
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:18,030
♫ Why can't I just erase it? ♫

611
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:22,610
♫ Something must have happened to my heart ♫

612
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:27,070
♫ I must have become a fool blinded by love ♫

613
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:31,610
♫ Just one place, everyday one place ♫

614
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:36,100
♫ Looking at the sad light called you ♫

615
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:41,530
♫ I guess even my tear glands are broken now ♫
