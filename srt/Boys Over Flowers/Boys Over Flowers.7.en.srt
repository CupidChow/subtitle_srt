when have we ever been known to joke around?

164
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,901
Be quiet and follow me!

165
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,740
Noona, noona!

166
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,420
Noona!

167
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:32,744
You guys, too. Follow me.

168
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:35,080
Let me go! Noona! Noona! Noona!

169
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,870
Noona!

170
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:44,256
Who is that?

171
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:48,750
Shinhwa Group's Goo Joon Hee sunbae, right?

172
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,320
They said Goo Joon Hee is above Min Seo Hyun.

173
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,490
She's the legendary Charisma Queen.

174
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,274
I can feel her aura, wow.

175
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:07,280
She's already married to the owner of the best hotel in the world.

176
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,010
She's my idol.

177
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,120
Do you know the type of guys I hate the most?

178
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,525
Selfish guys, narrow-minded guys, and unforgiving guys.

179
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:23,461
And what type of guy unfairly flaunts his power?

180
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:24,963
A selfish guy.

181
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:28,766
How about a guy who's unable to forgive a friend for a past mistake?

182
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:30,202
A narrow-minded guy.

183
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:33,471
And a guy who can't accept the consequences for his actions?

184
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:36,407
An unforgiving guy.

185
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:40,210
Okay, then.

186
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:45,580
Goo Joon Pyo and Yoon Ji Hoo, play a game together and accept the consequences, no matter what.

187
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,890
What do you mean game? Who agreed to do that?

188
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,022
No, I don't agree.

189
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:52,740
I agree!

190
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,070
Definitely... I agree.

191
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,060
I approve too.

192
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,250
Thank you, Noona.

193
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:08,307
I approve too.

194
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:11,243
What the heck? Who said you guys have the right to vote?

195
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:13,879
Stop it. It doesn't make any sense!

196
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,249
Five against one. The decision passed.

197
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:20,386
No way!

198
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,729
Then, I get to decide the game to compete in.

199
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:32,997
That's against fair play.

200
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:36,980
Don't worry. I already have everything ready. Bring it in, please.

201
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:58,056
A different sport activity has been placed inside each ball.

202
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:02,327
And they include sports that you've played, and some that you haven't.

203
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:05,464
What the heck? Choose the ones we've played before.

204
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:10,000
For the sake of fairness, we will randomly choose the balls.

205
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,940
The game starts as soon as we choose the type of game.

206
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,850
People say, "Being lucky also requires skill."

207
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:20,512
Is there going to be just one game?

208
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:25,650
I was thinking whoever wins two games out of three. What do you think?

209
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,620
I'll do it.

210
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,360
Fine, I'll do it.

211
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,266
The sport that is going to be used will be announced two days before the game.

212
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:45,130
Even if you are not good at that sport,

213
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,870
you still need to agree to the result. Okay?

214
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,270
The three related to the incident in question, please come forward.

215
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,900
You.

216
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:17,430
Related to the incident?

217
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,320
Me?

218
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,441
Me?

219
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:36,240
Let's start then.

220
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:39,391
Jan Di, you press.

221
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,207
Ji Hoo.

222
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:03,882
Joon Pyo.

223
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:32,008
- Horse racing?
- Yes, that's right.

224
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:35,212
- Who's better at it?
- Ji Hoo sunbae.

225
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:36,882
That's good!

226
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:40,785
At least, the chances of him winning have increased!

227
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:44,260
Ga Eul, I'm telling you.

228
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,725
The theory of the universe is not that simple.

229
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:51,390
So have you received any signals?

230
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,190
Who do "they" think will win?

231
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,006
- They are saying that the probability is...
- The probability is?

232
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
...is half and half.

233
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,448
God! Who didn't know that already?

234
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:12,651
You're no help!

235
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:31,850
♫ Days are too heavy and slow ♫

236
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,520
♫ Even though I try to show you my feelings, ♫

237
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,090
♫ You can't see it ♫

238
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:50,330
♫ I'm just blaming the time that has passed ♫

239
00:20:50,330 --> 00:21:00,920
♫ The seasons change again and again, yet I'm still sad ♫

240
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,769
Young Master! Young Master!

241
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:06,738
Are you all right?

242
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,870
It is too much for Jupiter's current condition.

243
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,410
Why don't you pick another horse?

244
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,050
No.

245
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,990
I need that horse.

246
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:21,819
- Coach Park!
- Yes, Young Master.

247
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,720
Tell me honestly.

248
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:26,985
Do you think I can win against Ji Hoo?

249
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,292
Never mind. I'm going to win tomorrow, no matter what.

250
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,580
♫ Oh! My love for you ♫

251
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,090
♫ One more time! ♫

252
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,074
Are you sure you wouldn't like to ride it first?

253
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:53,650
I'm choosing this horse because it is such an important race.

254
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,150
Please take good care of him.

255
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,360
Young Master...

256
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,930
this race, do you really have to do it?

257
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,932
If I could avoid it, I would want to do that as well.

258
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:17,503
I didn't teach you both horse riding so that you young masters could use them to fight with each other.

259
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,370
Sorry.

260
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,020
Oh! Horse!

261
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,140
H-h-horse!!

262
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,810
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo!

263
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,190
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo!

264
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,120
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo!

265
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,980
Ready... Go!

266
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,900
♫ Yes yes yo ♫

267
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,600
♫ Yes yes yo ♫

268
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,600
♫ My heart goes bang bang boom when I see you ♫

269
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,150
♫ I stay up all night because of the excitement ♫

270
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:08,160
♫ I style myself up moderately, oh yeah ♫

271
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,700
♫ My scooter, which is shinier ♫

272
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,890
♫ This road also welcomes you, way ♫

273
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,560
♫ The sun shines over us ♫

274
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,390
♫ I want to confess now ♫

275
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,950
♫ I gather up my courage and say ♫

276
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,990
♫ I love you more than anyone else in this world ♫

277
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,170
♫ I want only you ♫

278
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,070
♫ I won't hurt you ♫

279
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,410
♫ I want to have only you ♫

280
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,850
♫ Get up, stand up, my heart goes bang bang
boom when I see you ♫

281
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,560
♫ Oh, let it be, excuse me my baby ♫

282
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,500
♫ Lady who captivates me in a second ♫

283
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,720
♫ My heart's like a dynamite that'll burst ♫

284
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,500
♫ Oh, get up, bigger, stand up, my heart's fluttering ♫

285
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,940
♫ Oh, the closer I get to you, the more intense
my feelings get, bang bang boom ♫

286
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,900
Woah!

287
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,840
[Warning - cliff]

288
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,610
Going on the mountains is too much for him in this condition.

289
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,800
It will be fatal to him if you force him to run.

290
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,370
[Warning - cliff]

291
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,836
Let's go!

292
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,420
Please go!

293
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,374
What's their battle record?

294
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:08,800
Maybe about 49 wins and 1 tie?

295
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,480
Which side?

296
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,310
No one can beat Ji Hoo in horse racing. Even among us, no one...

297
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,230
Heh, we're saved.

298
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:23,930
Hey, there.

299
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:26,819
Hey, it's Goo Joon Pyo sunbae!

300
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,170
Goo Joon Pyo!

301
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,160
Goo Joon Pyo, fighting!

302
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,310
Wow, it's amazing!

303
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,230
What happened?

304
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,440
Oh, no!

305
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,010
Goo Joon Pyo!

306
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,150
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo!

307
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,507
Wanna touch it?

308
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,442
Can I?

309
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,390
His name is Rui.

310
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,880
Hello, Rui!

311
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,088
I'm Geum Jan Di.

312
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,670
Rui,

313
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,864
it's been hard on you, right? It's all right.

314
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,066
Thank you!

315
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,570
Here!

316
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:02,050
What? Really?

317
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:05,038
He wants you to ride on him.

318
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:10,989
Is that all right? I'm heavy.

319
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,660
This horse will not be able to race again.

320
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,520
No. Do something.

321
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:12,850
Do something, please, Coach Park!

322
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,721
I'm sorry, Young Master.

323
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:32,150
You might have won the game, but you lost the race.

324
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:38,476
I hope you learned something from today, my dear brother.

325
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:43,015
If that's not the case, Jupiter's suffering will have been for nothing.

326
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,395
It's time to open Ji Hoo's, right?

327
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,680
Mom! Mom!

328
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,160
Mom!

329
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,580
No!

330
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:21,680
Good morning!

331
00:33:24,384 --> 00:33:26,753
What are you guys up to this morning?

332
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:35,762
Butler Lee, the soup is awesome!

333
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,666
Joon Pyo, are you really going to do it?

334
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:44,320
I didn't pick it. It was he who picked it.

335
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,820
Well, I guess it's his bad luck.

336
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,340
What was the saying?

337
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:50,577
"Being lucky requires skill."

338
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:52,946
That's it! That!

339
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:55,883
Ji Hoo, that punk, I don't think he'll be able to do it.

340
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:58,450
Well, he really doesn't need to force himself.

341
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,620
If he forfeits, then it's automatically... what was that word?

342
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,258
A win by default.

343
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:06,793
Yes, that's right. A win by default.

344
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:10,140
Then, I would have two wins.

345
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,240
So no need for another competition.

346
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:18,038
I knew this was what's going to happen.

347
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:21,670
YingGuaEungBo. SaPalGuiJung.
(T/N: supposed to be SaPilGuiJung)

348
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:25,445
What the heck is he saying?

349
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:27,730
YingGuaEungBo (What goes around comes around).

350
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,930
SaPilGuiJung (Justice will assert itself).

351
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,254
My brother, you're that happy, huh?

352
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:36,390
Yup. I'm happy. I'm really excited.

353
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,870
Good for you!

354
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:52,906
Noona!

355
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,060
What's so funny?!

356
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,940
Are you laughing?

357
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,820
I hope you are mentally ready.

358
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,121
Ready for what?

359
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:43,323
Ji Hoo sunbae absolutely cannot win.

360
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:47,490
So the competition is over now.

361
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,131
You, Geum Jan Di, will be kicked out as planned!

362
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:54,934
Have you packed your bag yet?

363
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:57,690
It's not over yet.

364
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,260
I believe in Ji Hoo sunbae.

365
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,640
Not too long ago, you were saying that to Joon Pyo sunbae.

366
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,100
You, low class people,

367
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,050
have no consistency, do you?

368
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,680
It gives me goosebumps

369
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,030
to think that Ji Hoo sunbae will be hurt because of a girl like you!

370
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,965
What do you mean?

371
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,843
I should tell him not to do this.

372
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:39,679
Do you think there's another way?

373
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,050
Can't you ask his noona for help?

374
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,187
She's already helped me a lot.

375
00:36:47,187 --> 00:36:49,389
So you're just going to get kicked out like this?

376
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:53,760
I'd rather get kicked out, then end up breaking Ji Hoo sunbae's heart.

377
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,720
Do you think Ji Hoo sunbae would let you do that?

378
00:37:04,837 --> 00:37:09,005
What is it? If you can't stop him, you should support him.

379
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:10,744
Hurry up and go.

380
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,710
Here.

381
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,751
Thank you, boss!

382
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:20,486
Geum Jan Di, fighting!

383
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,760
Ga Eul, what day is the competition?

384
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,650
Why?

385
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:32,950
Well,

386
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,400
Prince Andromeda should be there too.

387
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:37,437
What should I wear that day?

388
00:37:37,437 --> 00:37:40,606
Ga Eul, how is my skin? It's damaged, right?

389
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:45,180
I should go in and take care of it!

390
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,484
He is so pathetic!

391
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:52,810
What the heck is wrong with him?

392
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,650
♫ Because I'm stupid ♫

393
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:17,870
♫ I know no one but you ♫

394
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:23,100
♫ But you are looking at someone else ♫

395
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,330
♫ You wouldn't know how I feel ♫

396
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:33,500
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

397
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,780
♫ I wouldn't even be in your memory ♫

398
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,260
♫ I still keep looking at you only ♫

399
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,272
There is something I want to ask you.

400
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,110
Go ahead.

401
00:38:50,377 --> 00:38:53,420
How were you able to get your license?

402
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,449
You heard about it, huh?

403
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:03,540
Seo Hyun taught me.

404
00:39:04,356 --> 00:39:07,310
I really didn't want to.

405
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:12,570
But because I didn't want to be embarrassed, I tried my hardest.

406
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:17,690
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

407
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:22,970
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

408
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:28,280
♫ "I love you" plays on my mouth ♫

409
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,852
Please stop now.

410
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:34,750
Why?

411
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,659
Because all of this is not worth it.

412
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:44,397
It's not like I'm going to that school because I wanted to.

413
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:46,932
It is worth it.

414
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:51,037
I don't know if I will win.

415
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:53,220
But, I'm going to try my best.

416
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,140
I want to.

417
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,030
Aren't you going to give that to me?

418
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,710
Oh, right. Do you want to eat it?

419
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,770
♫ Is like a beautiful wound ♫

420
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:22,980
♫ Even if I see your pretty smile, ♫

421
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:29,430
♫ I can't even smile with you ♫

422
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:36,040
♫ On the days that I think of you too much ♫

423
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,230
It's delicious.

424
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:43,540
Please have more!

425
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,710
♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

426
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:57,200
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

427
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,010
- Hey! Let's go quickly!
- Move. Move quickly!

428
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,260
Do your job right!

429
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,950
What a crappy car!

430
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,320
Do you all want to get fired?

431
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,170
♫ The breeze that brushed off you ♫

432
00:41:52,170 --> 00:42:00,850
♫ Is passing by me now ♫

433
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,850
♫ In my heart ♫

434
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:09,270
♫ Perhaps there's only the sunlight that shines you ♫

435
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:14,540
♫ Even pain and wounds are embraced ♫

436
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:22,220
♫ Love U, I think of you now ♫

437
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,860
♫ I close my eyes again ♫

438
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:30,150
♫ Love U, if I could fill your two eyes ♫

439
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:36,180
♫ Love U, if you show me your smile ♫

440
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,850
♫ Even the starlight there ♫

441
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:46,080
♫ I will bring everything and give it to you ♫

442
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,500
♫ Love U, if I could convey these feelings of mine ♫

443
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:57,520
♫ Love U, if you teach me how that feels ♫

444
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,190
♫ I'll follow all of that ♫

445
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:06,180
♫ Love U Love U Love U ♫

446
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,610
♫ Forever ♫

447
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,600
♫ My dear ♫

448
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,610
Yi Jung, are you done with the preparations for your display?

449
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,900
Well... yes.

450
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,569
When did you say it was?

451
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:43,705
I think it's... probably going to be next month.

452
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,530
Come on in!

453
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,222
The weather is so nice today, isn't it?

454
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,340
Come and take a seat.

455
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,506
What do you want to drink? We have a special hot cocoa, do you want to try that?

456
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:19,760
Your friend too?

457
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,944
Don't say no, it's really good.

458
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:25,690
Butler Lee, can you bring us some hot cocoa?

459
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,400
Help yourself

460
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,790
Have some.

461
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:39,061
Hey, buddy.

462
00:44:41,831 --> 00:44:46,720
Please, I beg you, why don't you just forget about all this?

463
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:53,070
Be careful.

464
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,449
Stop being so hard on yourself and just drop all of this.

465
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,685
Are you worried?

466
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:07,155
Please, be careful.

467
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:20,502
Excuse me... you know, it's all over if you lose now.

468
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:23,720
Do you have a strategy... no,

469
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,610
something like an ace up your sleeve?

470
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,470
You do, right?

471
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:33,630
You should.

472
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,530
An ace?

473
00:45:43,692 --> 00:45:45,300
I do.

474
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,980
Excuse me—

475
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,611
Don't move.

476
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:12,788
It's silly, but this is our strategy. Help me out.

477
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,154
Joon Pyo, I'm sorry.

478
00:46:46,154 --> 00:46:49,691
I just want to protect her, even if it's by doing this.

479
00:46:51,427 --> 00:46:53,500
Yoon Ji Hoo,

480
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,031
you must be out of your mind!

481
00:46:56,031 --> 00:46:59,250
Not once, but twice!

482
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,770
Wait, no, including the one at the airport, it's three times!

483
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:07,342
You're dead.

484
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,690
♫ Although I ask it to stop, to stop wherever it is ♫

485
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:37,140
♫ My heart keeps going to you ♫

♫ Why is my love like this? ♫

♫ Can't you love me? ♫

495
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,950
Jan Di, look at that.

496
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,360
That!

497
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:20,635
These boys... they have grown so fast.

498
00:50:20,635 --> 00:50:22,804
I know.

499
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,270
I'm so glad I came back to Korea!

500
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:30,210
This is so much more entertaining than Hollywood.

501
00:50:30,211 --> 00:50:33,640
I am pretty entertained as well.

502
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,122
Die, die!

503
00:50:44,157 --> 00:50:47,495
Monkeys can also fall off a tree sometimes.

504
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:51,466
He was so confident in himself.

505
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:54,860
By the way, Ji Hoo finally drove.

506
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,574
I know! If it wasn't for Geum Jan Di, would he have do that?

507
00:50:59,574 --> 00:51:00,960
Did you see them?

508
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,610
They're pretty intimate now.

509
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:07,690
Die!

510
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:15,400
What's wrong?

511
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,070
Why doesn't it work?

512
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,430
Hey, it looks like it's broken!

513
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,930
Just look at how he treats it.

514
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,572
Now it's the final competition.

515
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:33,660
Let's open Jan Di's.

516
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:53,680
[Swimming]

517
00:51:58,577 --> 00:52:01,890
Ridiculous. What is this?

518
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:05,874
Hey, Geum Jan Di, you did this on purpose, right?

519
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:09,611
Tell me! You planned this all out?

520
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:13,113
I won't do this. I won't!

521
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:14,430
Do whatever you want.

522
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:19,480
But if you forfeit, the competition ends here and Ji Hoo wins automatically.

523
00:52:19,487 --> 00:52:20,750
What are you talking about?

524
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:26,360
I told you when the competition started that you had to agree to the consequences, regardless of the results.

525
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,450
Even though they agreed,

526
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:35,050
if the competition just ends here, Joon Pyo and us too, we'd feel bad to lose like this.

527
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,538
So?

528
00:52:37,538 --> 00:52:40,480
If it's okay with you, I'd like to compete in his place.

529
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,976
What?

530
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:47,280
Ji Hoo, he crossed the line this time.

531
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,860
Well, that sounds pretty reasonable.

532
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,110
I'm okay with it if everyone else is.

533
00:52:57,118 --> 00:52:58,570
What do you guys think?

534
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:01,820
I agree 100%.

535
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,923
I agree too.

536
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:05,992
I'm against it.

537
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:07,530
What?

538
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,030
Geum Jan Di!

539
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:14,050
I will join too.

540
00:53:15,267 --> 00:53:18,350
Since Yi Jung sunbae is playing for Goo Joon Pyo,

541
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:22,880
I will play for Ji Hoo sunbae.

542
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,447
Your opponent is Yi Jung. He's a guy, and he's pretty good too.

543
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:31,551
This has to do with me, too. I can't just sit back and watch.

544
00:53:31,551 --> 00:53:35,555
Don't be ridiculous, how can a girl compete against a guy? Just stay out of it!

545
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:38,624
I also could get kicked out of school.

546
00:53:38,624 --> 00:53:42,929
So I should try my best. That way I won't have any regrets later on, right?

547
00:53:45,766 --> 00:53:50,040
Then... how about two against two?

548
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,606
Me?

549
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:54,574
I agree.

550
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:58,320
Jan Di, if this is how you want it to be, go for it.

551
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:04,918
Is it enough for you guys to want it to be so?

552
00:54:04,918 --> 00:54:08,955
Goo Joon Pyo, I'm not going to let her win just because she's a girl.

553
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:11,680
I'll try my best to beat Ji Hoo.

554
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,773
Okay, then until the final competition, we have seventy hours left.

555
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,800
♫ In my love, you're my heart ♫

556
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:52,420
♫ In my love, you're my heart ♫

557
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,170
♫ In my love, you're my heart ♫

558
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,540
♫ Just baby come come together ♫

559
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:03,920
Can't you do any better?

560
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,840
Forget it, I'm not doing this!

561
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,216
Stupid! I bet even I could do better than you!

562
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:17,000
♫ In my heart that has been empty so far ♫

563
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:21,700
♫ In my heart that had become used to being alone ♫

564
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:27,100
♫ You came to me someday and ♫

565
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:31,590
♫ You have now become my everything ♫

566
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:36,290
♫ Love is fire, I still, to you I still ♫

567
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:37,770
♫ Love is fire ♫

568
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:40,813
Ten more minutes!

569
00:55:40,813 --> 00:55:44,020
♫ Love is fire, keep looking at me ♫

570
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,070
♫ Just baby, come, come, come, come together ♫

571
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:53,270
♫ I'm looking for you ♫

572
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,350
Why did you ever say such a thing?

573
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,444
Seriously... why did I?

574
00:56:11,444 --> 00:56:17,183
You know what it is. Your desire to help out anyone.

575
00:56:17,183 --> 00:56:20,020
I just didn't want sunbae to get hatred because of me.

576
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,020
So it's okay if he loses because of you?

577
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,750
That's why I have to win.

578
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:26,125
Are you confident?

579
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:27,720
Seriously!

580
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,940
What's going to happen?

581
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,630
If only I had a time machine, then I could see what the future holds.

582
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,530
Jan Di! A little bit faster, faster!

583
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,370
Three, two, one!

584
00:56:41,574 --> 00:56:43,276
What is it? What did you dream about?

585
00:56:43,276 --> 00:56:47,012
- You dreamed about Jan Di's competition, right?
- Who won?

586
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:49,180
Well...

587
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,580
- Until the last minutes of the race, it was neck and neck. Neck and neck!
- And?

588
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,623
They reached their hands and at that moment...

589
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,410
At that moment,

590
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,350
It went black.

591
00:57:03,595 --> 00:57:07,364
Black. Fade out.

592
00:57:07,364 --> 00:57:10,204
- Then what is that?
- It's a meaningless dream.

593
00:57:10,204 --> 00:57:13,720
You are no help at all!

594
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:16,180
This cannot happen.

595
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:21,113
Yi Jung or whatever his name is, we must do whatever we can.

596
00:57:21,113 --> 00:57:23,650
Whatever we can?

597
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,680
We can put laxatives in their porridge and give it to them.

598
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,395
No! Ga Eul, how could you think of something like that?!

599
00:57:30,395 --> 00:57:35,395
You just can't distinguish between your allies and your enemies, just because you admire his beauty!

600
00:57:35,395 --> 00:57:40,368
No! I mean you can't use the holy porridge for such an evil scheme.

601
00:57:40,368 --> 00:57:43,380
No, No, never! Understand?

602
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,480
Porridge is supposed to be given to cure the sick

603
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,870
and to console the tired. How many times do I have to tell you?!

604
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:54,814
He is not gonna stop now.

605
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:57,784
Okay. Okay.

606
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,540
Then, how about running him over with a bike from behind?

607
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,180
Ga Eul!

608
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,626
You see? I told you he liked him.

609
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,660
Then... you're telling me to deliberately lose?

610
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,231
Whether they win or lose, it isn't your business. But for Jan Di...

611
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:46,566
She'll have to withdraw from school.

612
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:51,838
Aren't you embarrassed to work your butt off to win against a girl?

613
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:57,543
Don't you think it's even more embarrassing to lose after you work your butt off to win against a girl?

614
00:58:57,543 --> 00:59:01,681
So, you're saying even if you die, you'll win this race?

615
00:59:01,681 --> 00:59:06,319
Well, I have no intention of putting my life on the line over something like this, but I'm saying I won't take this lightly.

616
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,087
- Hey!
- Hey.

617
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,558
Hey!
I don't think you're in a position to complain.

618
00:59:11,558 --> 00:59:12,925
What?

619
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:16,896
I warned you, didn't I? I warned you that it would be best to stop her.

620
00:59:16,896 --> 00:59:21,567
I came to your rice restaurant and gave you some friendly advice.

621
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:24,237
It's not a rice restaurant, but a porridge restaurant.

622
00:59:24,237 --> 00:59:28,474
Those of the same species gather together. So that's true after all.

623
00:59:28,474 --> 00:59:29,842
What do you mean?

624
00:59:29,842 --> 00:59:32,746
Geum Jan Di's nosiness, is that an infectious disease?

625
00:59:32,746 --> 00:59:33,980
You little!

626
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,249
The exit door is over there.

627
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,328
Ah, cold!

628
00:59:49,328 --> 00:59:50,797
I'm home!

629
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:53,030
Come over here.

630
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,570
Come here quickly!

631
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:57,503
- Why?
- What do you mean, "why?"

632
00:59:57,503 --> 00:59:59,080
Did something happen?

633
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,600
That's what we want to ask.

634
01:00:01,607 --> 01:00:05,370
What is this about the competition and withdrawal from school?

635
01:00:06,677 --> 01:00:07,990
- Oh, that...
- Ah, be quiet!

636
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:11,310
Only answer with yes or no.

637
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,410
Mom, about that...

638
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:18,750
You cheated on Goo Joon Pyo with Yoon Ji Hoo and now you're going to be expelled from school. Is that all true?

639
01:00:18,758 --> 01:00:21,095
- Well, that is...
- Yes or no?

640
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:22,928
Yes!

641
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:24,240
What—

642
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,860
Oh my goodness! How can you, when you're in such a school?

643
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:32,770
About school... I can just attend the one I was in before.

The one before? The one before? You!

Is there a Joon Pyo in your old school? Speak, speak!

646
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:41,540
Honey, calm down. Let's think about this.

647
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,150
He was too good for us from the beginning.

648
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,610
But we still have our dry cleaning business!

649
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,121
- You'll see, things will stay good...
- Dad!

650
01:00:49,121 --> 01:00:51,558
If noona gets expelled, the business is over.

651
01:00:51,558 --> 01:00:54,626
No one will come to our shop anymore!

652
01:00:54,626 --> 01:00:56,150
This is not the time for this.

653
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:58,770
Let's go apologize for her fault. Honey, take out your curls.

654
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:00,900
Kang San, take a mat.

655
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:05,530
Noona, I don't ever remember raising you that way.

656
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,870
I'm disappointed.

657
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:10,870
Dad!

658
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:15,681
You! The day you're expelled, you are disowned from the family.

659
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:18,784
Even if you think about it a hundred times, it was your fault.

660
01:01:18,784 --> 01:01:23,255
How dare you two-time when you're still wet behind your ears?!

661
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,295
How can you say that honey? After all, she got it from you.

662
01:01:27,295 --> 01:01:29,820
Oh, my god, honey!

663
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:32,540
- Huh? Mom?
- No!

664
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,680
What are you saying!

665
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,100
I'm telling you this because I've experienced it firsthand,

666
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,790
but when someone cheats, it really pisses you off.

667
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:45,680
But when the girl says "sorry",

668
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,250
it is the man's job to forgive. So...

669
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,570
So?

670
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:57,610
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize!

671
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:04,220
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Apologize!

Where are you going this late?

675
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,973
I'm going to practice, why?

676
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,042
You want to win that badly?

677
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,546
We have no choice.

678

We?

679
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,588
Why does it have to be Ji Hoo?

680
01:03:05,456 --> 01:03:07,680
If it wasn't Ji Hoo...

Goo Joon Pyo.

It's not too late.

683
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,570
Just once,

684
01:03:25,878 --> 01:03:27,910
say that you like me.

685
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:31,350

♫ "I love you" plays on my mouth ♫

Date?

694
01:04:01,376 --> 01:04:04,080
I can't imagine Ji Hoo and Jan Di together.

695
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:08,317
They might just go somewhere sunny and take a nap.

696
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,190
I'll go out for some fresh air, and some exercise!

I always thought that I was in debt to Ji Hoo.

I can't ruin Jan Di so that nobody will want her again.
