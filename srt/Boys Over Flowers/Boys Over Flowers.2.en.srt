8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,650
- Let go!
- Be quiet! Be quiet!

9

10

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,034
What?

17
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:11,950
I did as you told me, but the pancake didn't rise.

18
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:17,579
Maybe... baking powder?

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,047
Yes, that.

20

And, they sell that too, right?

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,720

29
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,710
I'll have to try it again.

30
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,610
Sunbae...

31
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,320
thank you for helping me.

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,350

33

Yeah, he had to appear at that exact moment.

Who told you guys to do that kind of stuff?

37

You said to give Geum Jan Di a bitter taste.

38
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:03,251
I told you to scare her. Who told you to go that far?

39
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,620
We're sorry. We were wrong.

40
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,055
Do you want me to make you guys stop coming to school, too?

41
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,791
Get lost! I don't even want to see your faces.

42
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,860

00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,266
Jan Di, are you really okay?

44
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,035
Nothing major really happened.

45

That's nothing?

46
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:28,343
That "F4" or whatever... I was going to let them off easy because they're good-looking!

47
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:29,950
Those kinds of people tend to hang out with people just like them.

48
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,240
So it's the four of them, huh?

49
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,950
Well, it's not really like that.

50
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,352
What do you mean "it's not like that?"

51
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:41,122
One of them seems to be kind of different.

52
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:43,030
One of them?

53
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,030
Who?

54
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,760
Wow! This commercial is really killer.

55
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,540
Sunbae, you seem to really like her.

56
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,240
Even so, you shouldn't put your hands there.

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,500
They'll turn black and dirty.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,177
She's really pretty, isn't she?

59
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:47,148
This is called "The Advent of a Goddess."

60
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,949
- "Goddess?"
- This unnie is not just pretty.

61
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,220
She is very smart, and

62
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,157
she donated all the money she earned from her modeling job.

63
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:01,328
She passed the French BAR exam, too, a while ago.

64
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:05,332
Do you know all of these things about her?

65
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:10,270
Of course. She is my idol.

66
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,939
"Idol?"

67
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:21,015
People expect her to be the successor of her parents' law firm after graduation.

68
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:24,050
But I think a little differently.

69
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,723
I think she's going to do something better and greater.

70
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,590
Every vacation she goes to Africa, Afghanistan,

71
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,490
and, recently, she visited Tibet too.

72
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,110
This is just my imagination,

73
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,250
but I'd like to see if she marries a royal family member, or the President, or something like that.

74
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:54,600
Like a princess who devotes herself to world peace, like Princess Diana or Audrey Hepburn.

75
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,550
Sort of...

76
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,554
She is just a model.

77
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,490
So?

78
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,860
The President of France got divorced to marry a model.

79
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,380
Who knows? Someone who deserves to be a future French President

80
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,630
or some prince in Europe might fall in love with her and propose.

81
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,430
I think it is a quite practical scenario.

82
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,340
Don't you think so?

83
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,370
Whenever I see you, you are very annoying and noisy.

84

85
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
What would you know?

86
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,142
Hey, Kang San! Aren't you going to eat?

87
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,746
You were online all day long!

88
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,148
Is food or money coming out of it?

89
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,883
Electromagnetic waves are coming out of it.

90
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,054
San, be careful! You can cut our family line.

91
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:08,010
Money as well as food comes out!

92

93

94
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,061
Cyber Arbaitu (Internet part-time job).

95

Honey, it's not that.

103

It means "a radish with little (jom) defects(hm)"

104

Hmjommoo means "Hm, if it is true,

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,530
Merely you?

166
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,108
Speaking of the devil...

167
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:18,245
Didn't I tell you she was going to come sooner or later?

168
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,217
You're a bit late in saying you're sorry.

169
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:25,019
You tested my patience for the last time!

170
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,950
I'm warning you. Go away.

171
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,120
That's my warning to you. Okay?

172
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,840
Hey, laundry girl,

173
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,030
is this the kind of apology all commoners give?

174
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,903
In the world of the wealthy, does the victim apologize to the wrongdoer?

175
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,450
What? Wrongdoer?

176
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,359
You, what are you doing?

177
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,930
Didn't I tell you? You've tried the last bit of my patience.

178
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,260
I told you, you jerk! I told you!

179
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,790
Did you see me?

180
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,925
Did you ever see me sleeping with a guy, or even holding hands with one? Did you see me?

181
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:41,420
I'm a virgin. I haven't even had my first kiss yet.

182
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,030
And you go and spread such a rumor?

183
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:53,160
You!

184
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:02,280
If you keep playing such dirty pranks like this, you're dead meat next time!

185
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,795
She is really something!

186
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,368
She dominated the great Goo Joon Pyo with a preemptive strike.

187
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:57,010
Going to school and having something interesting to see.

188
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,170
It's been a long time.

189
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:03,878
But, doesn't the tiny tot resemble someone?

190
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:07,790
You're right. That's what I thought, too.

191
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,650
Who could it be?

192
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,354
Joon Hee Noona!

193
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:15,590
What? Don't try to be funny.

194
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,913
No, no. She really acts like her.

195
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:19,390
Resemble, my foot!

196
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,460
How does that tacky commoner resemble my sister?

197
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,865
You would know better.

198
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:26,667
Shut up!

199
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,638
Why were you all giddy with yourself earlier?

200
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:33,674
Did you your head hit somewhere?

201
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:37,278
You guys still haven't noticed?

202
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,846
What?

203
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,600
I think that girl

204
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,880
has completely fallen for me, head over heels.

205
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,655
What?

206
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,400
Goo Joon Pyo,

207
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,094
how does the situation turn out that way?

208
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:59,433
Aren't you guys supposed to be pros at getting girls?

209
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,603
They say a girl's "No" is really a "Yes".

210
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:05,970
As much as she's screaming out that she doesn't like me,

211
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,340
she's falling for me, actually.

212
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,590
Think about it. For fear of being discovered by the one she loves,

213
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:19,019
she came in person making a fuss about first kiss and other nonsense.

214
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:21,289
If that's the logic...

215
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,524
Saying she's never kissed anyone...

216
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:28,796
That means... she's waiting to have her first kiss with me.

217
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,001
Bravo!! You really are something Goo Joon Pyo.

218
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:36,704
Even as my friend, you really are something this time.

219
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,890
Well, of course.

220
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:43,520
I thought it was weird that Goo Joon Pyo's charisma

221
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,110
didn't work on someone.

222
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,020
Stupid girl!

223
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,687
She thought I would be deceived if she talked to me in an angry tone.

224
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,592
A girl being too frank makes a man feel burdened, doesn't it?

225
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,140
[The Lovers]

226
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:39,934
Do you have to go to school this way, Geum Jan Di?

227
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:45,406
My bad temper always gets me in trouble.

228
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:48,690
Why did you provoke him?

229
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,882
Are you Miss Geum Jan Di?

230
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:57,985
Y-yes, b-but...

231
00:18:57,985 --> 00:19:01,555
Will you come with us for a bit?

232
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:05,060
What? Where?

233
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,161
I'm just a bit busy right now.

234
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:09,897
We have received orders to bring you.

235
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,733
From who?

236
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,969
You'll find out if you come with us.

237
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:22,520
I, I have to go to my part-time job,

238
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,870
so I'm a bit busy. Sorry.

239
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,088
Misters, why are you following me?

240
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:50,337
- She's not there either?
- No, Sir.

241
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:52,806
Well, let's go look for her again. You guys look over there, we'll go over here.

242
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:54,341
Yes, Sir.

243
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:20,962
Come with us.

244
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:24,200
Mister, let me down!

245
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:28,570
Let go of me!

246
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:34,075
- What are you doing?
- Stay still!

247
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:38,147
- What the heck?
- Stop this! What are you doing?

248
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:41,617
Let's leave.

249
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:53,560
What a smell.

250
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,830
It smells like I'm in a flower garden.

251
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,420
Warm, soft... and...

252
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,306
my body... my body...

253
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,808
Someone's touching it?

254
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,881
We don't need suction, do we?

255
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,652
No need. Since it's not fat but muscles, it won't be effective.

256
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,120
Is the laser set?

257
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,889
Take off the wax before doing it.

258
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,700
♫ Stand by me, look at me ♫

259
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,200
♫ I might not know love yet ♫

260
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,410
♫ Stand by me, watch over me ♫

261
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,350
♫ I think I'm still not good with love ♫

262
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,500
♫ The more I see you, my mood gets better ♫

263
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,800
♫ I sing unknowingly ♫

264
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,100
♫ I want to buy a rose ♫

265
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,500
♫ Such a side of myself surprises me ♫

266
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,730
♫ I feel like my heart is going to you ♫

267
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,110
♫ This world is beautiful ♫

268
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,500
♫ If you feel this excitement too ♫

269
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,010
♫ Can you please wait for me? ♫

270
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,100
♫ Stand by me, watch over me ♫

271
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,800
♫ I think I'm still not good with love ♫

272
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:52,915
I think they are surprised because this is the first time

273
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:56,819
Young Master has ever brought a woman home.

274
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,022
Well, can I ask you a question?

275
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:03,491
Yes.

276
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:08,997
Well... This is... Korea, right?

277
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:10,633
Yes, that's right.

278
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:14,436
Am I at the Blue House or something like it?

279
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,538
No.

280
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:19,174
I have one more question.

281
00:23:19,174 --> 00:23:21,610
Yes, you may go ahead and ask.

282
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,114
I am not a miss, I am Jan Di, Geum Jan Di.

283
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,851
Yes, Miss Geum Jan Di.

284
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,990
Right now, why am I here?

285
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,726
I also do not know the reason, Miss.

286
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:40,162
Where are we going right now?

287
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:42,431
We are almost there now.

288
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:44,666
He's waiting for you.

289
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,690
Waiting?

290
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,800
Who?

291
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,886
Ji Hoo Sunbae?

292
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,340
You?

293
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,760
Why in the world are you here?

294
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,033
What's so wrong with me being in my house?

295
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,935
"My house?"

296
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,906
You mean this mansion is your house?

297
00:24:56,906 --> 00:24:58,974
That's right.

298
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:00,876
Why?

299
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:04,546
What are you planning to do?

300
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:08,617
I already did everything.

301
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:17,927
Look at yourself.

302
00:25:19,628 --> 00:25:22,064
Aren't you surprised?

303
00:25:23,632 --> 00:25:30,038
The Ugly Duckling can transform into an egret by spending a little money.

304
00:25:30,706 --> 00:25:32,820
Wasn't it a swan?

305
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,911
That doesn't matter.

306
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:41,116
What in the world are you doing? I did not ask for anything like this.

307
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:46,054
Hey commoner, just say the truth. Tell me that you like me.

308
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,992
Oh, you're the style that says the opposite, right?

309
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:54,096
Goo Joon Pyo, there is a limit to your playing.

310
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,770
This is illegal. Kidnapping and confinement.

311
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,000
It's a serious crime, don't you know that?

312
00:25:59,702 --> 00:26:04,072
Since there's no one here, you can just tell me that you like me.

313
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,245
From now on, when outside of school, I'll allow you to say hello to me.

314
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:12,040
What?

315
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,350
Are you surprised by such an incredible offer?

316
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,753
Do you want me to say it again?

317
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:23,020
From now on, if you listen to me well, when no one's around

318
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,020
you can also be my girlfriend.

319
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:32,150
Understand?

320
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:35,270
You've gone crazy, right?

321
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:38,673
You did go crazy, huh?

322
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:43,512
You, because you ate so much greasy food, is your brain not working?

323
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:47,016
Who's becoming who's what?

324
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:49,919
Forget about it. I want to leave.

325
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:56,358
Isn't it you whose brain isn't working?

326
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:58,994
You better move when I say it nicely.

327
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:03,699
Do you know how much was spent on you, from your head to your toes?

328
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:08,070
- $100,000.
- What?

329
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:10,105
$100,000?

330
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:12,240
That's right.

331
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,544
But that's nothing.

332
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:18,880
If you were with me, you could enjoy much more than that every day.

333
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,730
Do you mean to tell me you don't want that?

334
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,551
Maybe you're the one who's crazy.

335
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:25,787
I'm only here because I was dragged here by a psycho.

336
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,923
You think I'm in the right state of mind?

337
00:27:28,923 --> 00:27:31,170
The moment I saw your face,

338
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,130
I felt like bugs were crawling all over my body.

339
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,882
Bring me my school uniform right now!

340
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:11,835
What is this?

341
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:25,914
Go and throw it away!

342
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:28,950
What are you doing?

343
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,820
Did you not hear me tell you to throw it away?

344
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,022
Yes, Young Master.

345
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:35,323
- And fire them all.
- What?

346
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:39,127
Fire everyone who served that girl.

347
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:42,664
What was with the hair? And the clothes?

348
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:45,599
Was that tacky style the best they could do?

349
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,130
Find other ones.

350
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,405
Go and bring the best ones.

351
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:54,209
Those who worked today were the best staff.

352
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:57,779
Then you can just find more expensive ones.

353
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:01,517
Yes, of course.

354
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:22,637
Oh my gosh! What is that?

355
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,541
A bee! Steward! A bee!

356
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:30,913
It's coming toward me! Hurry up and get rid of it!

357
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:35,584
Hurry, hurry!

358
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:45,994
Is it gone?

359
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,332
Yes, we got rid of it.

360
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:08,240
The tea,

361
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,502
did you make it?

362
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:13,939
I'm so sorry, Young Master.

363
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:19,678
Get rid of her.

364
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,592
This bathroom... It's bigger than my whole house.

365
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:19,260
By the way, Geum Jan Di,

366
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,670
did the cat get your tongue at that moment?

367
00:31:24,243 --> 00:31:26,380
And also,

368
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:30,400
it seems like you don't know,

369
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:33,460
you don't make friends with money;

370
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,220
you use your heart.

371
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:42,127
There's nothing money can't buy.

372
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,770
Speak.

373
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,030
Tell me if there's something it can't buy.

374
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:56,650
Can there truly be something money can't buy?

375
00:31:57,976 --> 00:31:59,870
If you have the courage,

376
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,240
why don't you tell me, commoner.

377
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:17,710
How embarrassing!

378
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,190
I'm so dumb!

379
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,472
It's you again.

380
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,646
What should I say?

381
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:14,286
Are you going somewhere?

382
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:15,921
Home.

383
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,224
You?

384
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:23,295
I'm going home too.

385
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:26,265
Going like that?

386
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,637
Some kind of problem came up.

387
00:33:33,772 --> 00:33:35,307
What?!

388
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:39,611
Whenever I see you, you look so dramatic.

389
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:41,647
That's right, huh?

390
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,790
Can I ask you something?

391
00:33:56,428 --> 00:34:00,432
Is there something money can't buy?

392
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:04,936
Something you can't buy, no matter how much you're willing to spend.

393
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,109
There couldn't be something like that, could there be?

394
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:16,113
There couldn't be something like that, right?

395
00:34:17,316 --> 00:34:18,583
Air.

396
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,018
What?

397
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,170
Oh, air.

398
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,460
You're right.

399
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,390
Why didn't I think of that?

400
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:37,236
You're a funny one, aren't you?

401
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:52,884
Wear those on your way home.

402
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:57,122
If you walk around like that in this neighborhood, you're going to be rounded up by the police.

403
00:36:31,116 --> 00:36:32,851
Who's this?

404
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:36,355
Aren't you Miss Wonder Girl who's the natural enemy of Goo Joon Pyo?

405
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:39,324
What brings you here? Joon Pyo is not here right now.

406
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:42,327
Who said I wanted to see that bastard?

407
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,967
Aren't those... Ji Hoo's shoes?

408
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:57,242
Please give this to him for me.

409
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:02,046
Wait a minute.

410
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,651
Why don't you drink some tea before you go?

411
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:15,226
Did you really tell Joon Pyo that?

412
00:37:15,226 --> 00:37:18,530
Woah, you're really something.

413
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,400
No one has pissed him off like that before.

414
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:25,710
Oh, it's Seo Hyun.

415
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,680
Shouldn't she be coming back soon?

416
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:32,944
Ji Hoo must be happy.

417
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,860
Well...

418
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:50,495
Have you guys known each other for a long time?

419
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:53,670
Yeah, since kindergarten.

420
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:56,068
I see.

421
00:37:57,336 --> 00:38:01,873
You... seem to be curious about something.

422
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:06,311
Just ask. As long as we know the answer, we'll tell you in return.

423
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:07,579
"In return?"

424
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,349
We've been pretty entertained these days, thanks to you.

425
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:22,390
Do Ji Hoo Sunbae and the model Min Seo Hyun

426
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,130
know each other?

427
00:38:25,864 --> 00:38:28,100
Know each other?

428
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:40,512
He was in a traffic accident when he was five years old.

429
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:44,783
His parents died at the scene and only he survived.

430
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,286
After that, he started to display symptoms of autism and he didn't get along with anyone.

431
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:52,257
The person that helped him out of his shell was Min Seo Hyun.

432
00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:55,694
For us, she's like a big sister and good friend,

433
00:38:55,694 --> 00:39:01,633
but for Ji Hoo, she's like his first love, his lover, like a mother.

434
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:17,560
So pretty...

435
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,750
How could she look like that?

436
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,088
It must be so nice to give birth to a daughter like her.

437
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:26,592
Even from a woman's perspective, she is so pretty and cool.

438
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:30,828
Min Seo Hyun. Mom, that woman is Min Seo Hyun, right?

439
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:35,900
God is so unfair...

440
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,304
To give someone a face, a brain, and even a family...

441
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:42,840
All to someone else.

442
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,211
What do you mean? He gave us such wide square shoulders!

443
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:53,184
Finished eating?

444
00:39:56,455 --> 00:40:00,811
The pressure of "The Daughter Of Mom's Friend" is enough to spoil her appetite.

445
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:06,450
That's right, you have eyes, wouldn't you want to go on a diet if you were her?

446
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,521
But is that woman going to be a lawyer or a model?

447
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:11,623
Of course she should be a lawyer!

448
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:13,358
She passed that hard exam.

449
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:15,793
I like her better as a model though.

450
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:18,996
That's why men are simple.

451
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:23,401
When she's young, she's a model, but when she's older, she'll be a lawyer.

452
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:25,737
My mom is so smart!

453
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:33,411
Jan Di, you're not eating any mandarins, right?

454
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:36,314
Hey! She's going to take some for lunch.

455
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:40,583
Dad? What's this?

456
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:41,719
What is this?

457
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,488
No! It's not...

458
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:47,926
What is this? 5,000 won ($5) on thunder bird (race horse).

459
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:51,200
Typhoon, 20,000 won ($20). Jil Chu, 30,000 won ($30).

460
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,564
Why you...

461
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:54,999
I am actually going to win this time.

462
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:58,102
Get out! Just take this and live with them!

463
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:02,660
I won't trust a word you say again or, my name is Thunderbird!

464
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,174
Get out!

465
00:41:04,174 --> 00:41:07,440
Mom, Thunderbird came in last. Last.

466
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,280
Pick something else.

467
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,790
♫ I know I shouldn't feel this way ♫

468
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:29,190
♫ A lie... If I said it was a lie ♫

469
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,400
♫ Will my heart come back to me? ♫

470
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
♫ Tears are falling ♫

471
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,200
♫ I can't look at you because I feel sorry ♫

472
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,330
♫ My heart aches ♫

473
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,970
♫ What should my first words be? ♫

474
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,010
♫ I can't think ♫

475
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,000
♫ While I feel like that ♫

476
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,900
♫ You keep making me have bad feelings ♫

477
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:03,300
♫ Forgetting you isn't a good feeling for me ♫

478
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,100
♫ It's a very bad feeling ♫

479
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,750
♫ It's a bad feeling, it's a bad feeling ♫

480
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,110
♫ Our love won't disappear forever ♫

481
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,900
♫ You make me have bad feelings ♫

482
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,400
♫ Forgetting you isn't a good feeling for me ♫

483
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,200
♫ It's a very bad feeling ♫

484
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,800
♫ It's a very bad feeling, it's a very bad feeling ♫

485
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,550
♫ Erasing our love ♫

486
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,950
♫ Isn't a good feeling for me ♫

What now?!

647
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:52,977
Honestly, you're actually glad to see me here, aren't you?

648
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:56,581
Say it. You were bored as hell in this stinky hole before I came, right?

649
00:56:56,581 --> 00:57:00,752
Before I met you, I was very happy, okay?

650
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:04,470
Well, since you go to our school,

651
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,690
you can come.

652
00:57:07,526 --> 00:57:11,996
I don't know what you're talking about, but I have no intentions of going to that!

653
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:13,866
Why you—!

654
00:57:25,043 --> 00:57:28,720
There's going to be a welcoming party for her. It should be fun.

655
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,820
You should come. You're coming, right?

656
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,330
Okay, I'll go.

657
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,820
I'll go for sure!

658
00:57:39,224 --> 00:57:42,627
Wait! Hey, you!

659
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:48,790
I know what you girls are going to say.

660
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,630
I don't want to go either, okay?

661
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,540
Come on!

662
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:57,030
Ji Hoo Sunbae and Joon Pyo Sunbae both invited you.

663
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:59,370
You have to come.

664
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,246
Don't you?

665
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:03,382
Uh, yeah.

666
00:58:03,382 --> 00:58:07,619
It's just that the guys forgot to tell you something.

667
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:10,187
Forgot to tell me something?

668
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:12,170
W-w-w-what are you doing?

669
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:13,959
Here's the thing...

670
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:15,660
Let's go.

671
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,759
Is this really okay?

672
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:49,430
It's going to be fine.

673
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,964
Once you step in there, other people will probably be wearing stuff that's more outrageous.

674
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:55,667
This is nothing.

675
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:58,803
That's not it... It's so embarrassing.

676
00:58:58,803 --> 00:59:03,274
What is? It's not easy to get the concept down so perfectly, like you.

677
00:59:03,274 --> 00:59:06,511
Don't worry. Geum Jan Di, fighting!

678
00:59:06,511 --> 00:59:10,530
I'm just going to leave.

679
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,452
Oh, no. A faint heart never wins, fair lady.

680
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:54,913
Jin Seon Mi or that, whatever. Just let me catch you.

681
01:00:54,913 --> 01:00:57,970
But... what an idiot...

682
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:02,090
I should know what to believe. How could I believe that?

683
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,350
I'm such an idiot.

684
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:12,998
Geum Jan Di!

685
01:01:16,035 --> 01:01:17,569
You guys...

686
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:22,341
You're late! Hello, I've been looking for you for so long.

687
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:24,743
Why won't you take off your coat?

688
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:26,579
Aren't you a bit hot?

689
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:27,920
I'm not hot!

690
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,649
Because of the ocean winds, I'm really cold!

691
01:01:30,649 --> 01:01:32,710
Oh, is that right?

692
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:35,053
Isn't your dress a little too thin?

693
01:01:35,053 --> 01:01:39,660
Lately, the new luxury items are pretty but show a bit too much skin.

694
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,293
Maybe yours is like that?

695
01:01:41,293 --> 01:01:42,661
Hurry up and take it off!

696
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:45,930
Why won't we just take it off for her?

697
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,150
What's that over there?

698
01:02:07,786 --> 01:02:10,556
What is this? Isn't that Wonder Woman?

699
01:02:10,556 --> 01:02:13,100
Can't you tell fantasy from reality? Just because they are calling her Wonder Girl on the internet,

700
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,494
she thinks she is Wonder Woman or something?

701
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:18,030
If you didn't have a dress, you should've just said so.

702
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:20,560
I know you want to stick out,

703
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,202
but this isn't the way to do it, you commoner.

704
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:27,873
So is this how commoners have fun these days?

705
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,778
Oh, my god, Wonder Woman?

706
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,545
I know why you kids are like this,

707
01:03:07,545 --> 01:03:09,814
but you know what?

708
01:03:09,814 --> 01:03:14,853
All you've proven is that you are the ones that are low class, not this girl.

709
01:03:16,288 --> 01:03:17,550
What are you doing, Ji Hoo?

710
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,120
Take her to my room.

711
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,776
Why is Ji Hoo doing something he's never done before?

712
01:03:38,776 --> 01:03:42,647
I don't know what it is, but isn't it a very interesting turn of events?

713
01:04:25,558 --> 01:04:27,250
Thank you.

714
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,728
You didn't have to do all this for me.

715
01:04:30,728 --> 01:04:34,199
It's my pleasure. It's no inconvenience at all.

716
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:38,136
I shouldn't have even come here.

717
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:40,972
Ji Hoo invited you, right?

718
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:44,776
If you're Ji Hoo's friend, you're an important friend to me as well.

719
01:04:46,378 --> 01:04:48,170
No.

720
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:50,980
He only invited me out of politeness.

721
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:55,954
No, Ji Hoo is not that kind of guy.

722
01:04:55,954 --> 01:05:01,192
And I've never seen him treat anyone else like that.

723
01:05:03,562 --> 01:05:06,732
Ji Hoo Sunbae is usually caring.

724
01:05:06,732 --> 01:05:09,568
Ji Hoo is usually caring?

725
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,600
Don't you see?

726
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,840
It's because you are a special girl.

727
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:21,880
I've heard all the hardships you went through because of Joon Pyo.

728
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,318
You said you certainly wouldn't lose, right?

729
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,220
That is...

730
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:32,223
It's because he's lonely.

731
01:05:32,223 --> 01:05:33,625
Pardon?

732
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:38,730
He's hiding his loneliness by bullying others. That rascal.

733
01:05:40,098 --> 01:05:42,500
Goo Joon Pyo is lonely?

734
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,860
No way!

735
01:05:46,672 --> 01:05:51,142
He may only see his parents once every year.

736
01:05:51,142 --> 01:05:56,620
From the moment he was born, he was never treated as a friend or a son.

737
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:01,350
He was always surrounded by people that only saw him as the heir of a plutocrat company.

738
01:06:01,919 --> 01:06:04,122
Can you imagine living like that?

739
01:06:08,026 --> 01:06:10,262
Don't lose, okay?

740
01:06:11,697 --> 01:06:12,965
Pardon?

741
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:17,535
I like you, so I'll support you.

742
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,776
Okay, we're done.

743
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,778
Stand up.

744
01:06:53,739 --> 01:06:56,541
They're so pretty.

745
01:06:56,541 --> 01:07:00,712
Shoes are the most important thing for a woman.

746
01:07:01,446 --> 01:07:03,181
Why is that?

747
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:09,721
Good shoes will take you to good places.

748
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:17,250
Okay, it's all done!

749
01:07:18,029 --> 01:07:20,131
Shall we go?

750
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:16,788
A gentleman should never leave a pretty lady by herself.

751
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:42,380
♫ At a time when I missed you so much ♫

752
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:46,630
♫ At a time when it's too hard to hold on ♫

753
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:50,890
♫ The "I love you" is stuck in my lips ♫

754
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:55,160
♫ Once again, crying for you ♫

755
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,460
♫ Once again, missing you ♫

756
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:05,050
♫ Baby, I love you. I'm waiting for you ♫

757
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:14,250
♫ In your everyday, I've never been by your side.
I don't even remember ♫

758
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:18,450
♫ I want you, but I can only see you ♫

759
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:23,450
♫ In the end, I've made my own memories ♫

760
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:31,210
♫ For me, love is like a beautiful wound ♫

761
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:35,450
♫ Even when I see your beautiful smile ♫

762
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:41,800
♫ I can't smile too. No, no ♫

763
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:46,160
♫ When I think about you too much ♫

764
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:50,390
♫ When my heart feels sick and sad ♫
