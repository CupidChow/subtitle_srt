00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:40,637
Who did you come with tonight?

163
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:42,860
I don't think you're with someone. What do you think about me??

164
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,175
What are you talking about? It's me that he wants!

165
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:48,111
Hey! Don't touch him. You're funny!

166
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:50,380
Hold on, hold on, sorry!

167
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,420
Hey, darling, why are you so late?

168
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Why did you get here so late?

169
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:05,260
What brings you here?

170
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:08,600
Seo Hyun Unnie invited me here, why?

171
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,534
Did you empty the department store?

172
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:14,120
I thought this last time too,

173
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,100
but doesn't Geum Jan Di look pretty good when she's all dressed up?

174
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,811
Right. You're the cutest one here.

175
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:23,620
Cute?

176
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,700
Can you transform a pumpkin into a watermelon just by drawing some lines on it?

177
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:32,588
- Well! Goo Joon Pyo...
- On point.

178
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:30,960
♪ Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you ♪

179
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,400
♪ Dear Min Seo Hyun ♪

180
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,390
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

181
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,593
Thank you all for coming here to celebrate my 23rd birthday with me.

182
00:23:02,593 --> 00:23:05,620
I would like to thank my family

183
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,970
and friends for their love and care.

184
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,480
I also have something else to announce to all of you.

185
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,340
That was why I held this huge party, which is so unlike me to do.

186
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,820
Where did that punk Ji Hoo go?

187
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,660
They're not gonna announce their engagement, are they?

188
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,090
I'm going back to Paris next week

189
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:33,990
I'm going back to Paris next week.
And I won't be returning to Korea. I've already packed and arranged everything.

190
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:39,363
I've already packed and arranged everything and folded my model activities.

191
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:41,131
What's she talking about?

192
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:43,300
I do not wish

193
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,650
to rely on the fruits of my parents' labor.

194
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,720
Instead, I would like to start fresh relying only on my own abilities.

195
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:59,710
I will not be taking over my parent's law firm.

196
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,870
Because I want a life where

197
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:08,620
I can travel the world and give back as much as I can.

198
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,220
My decision is bound to cause an uproar

199
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,000
since it will be hard for those of you with differing views to understand.

200
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:23,230
Everyone...

201
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,730
Please be happy for me.

202
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,863
Min Seo Hyun... She's always full of surprises!

203
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:50,500
Ji Hoo. Did he know about this the whole time?

204
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,772
Now we know the reason why he's been so depressed.

205
00:24:54,772 --> 00:25:00,477
It's impressive. It's impressive but, what's JiHoo gonna do?

206
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,063
Hi.

207
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,135
You still kept it.

208
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,030
It's from the first time we were separated.

209
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:35,560
You remember, huh.

210
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,240
It's since then

211
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,921
that you stopped calling me noona.

212
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:46,423
What was I to you?

213
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:56,734
Our JiHoo
must be very mad.

214
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:03,006
I also feel like I'm being thrown away.

215
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:06,460
If there is something here that can't be so easily thrown away...

216
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,670
it's you.

217
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,316
Don't lie!

218
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:14,260
If it was a lie,

219
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,480
then it wouldn't have bothered me that you're interested in someone else.

220
00:26:20,324 --> 00:26:21,325
What are you talking about?

221
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:24,210
When you dashed toward that girl,

222
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,160
I don't know why, but my heart sank.

223
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:30,033
When you're so kind to her, I felt hurt.
Funny, isn't it?

224
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,937
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

225
00:26:35,405 --> 00:26:37,990
But isn't it great?

226
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,440
Our Ji Hoo has really become a man.

227
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,349
Our Jihoo...Has really become a man.
Don't joke!

228
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,956
You'll do what you want anyway.

229
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:57,050
But you'll tighten me today and loosen me up tomorrow, so I can neither go to you nor distance myself from you.

230
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,220
I was just a toy.

231
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:01,600
If I lost you,

232
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,830
I would not be able to sleep.

233
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:08,839
Who's interested in whom?

234
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,542
Only looking at Min Seo Hyun for 15 years, it's not enough!

235
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,287
I'm a man too.

236
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:19,082
A man who is eager to embrace a woman called Min Seo Hyun!

237
00:27:28,224 --> 00:27:30,240
I know, me too.

238
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,610
Sorry, Ji Hoo.

239
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,710
I'm really sorry.

240
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:43,370
♫ Looks like is only natural ♫

241
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:50,270
♫ For you to ask me today ♫

242
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:57,250
♫ I'm just saying I'm fine, but you ♫

243
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:03,040
♫ Don't know me ♫

244
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:11,300
♫ I'm still thinking about you, ♫

245
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:17,140
♫ Maybe you never knew about it ♫

246
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:35,597
It would be really embarrassing if you got caught here.
It doesn't look good, don't you know?

247
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:38,850
Things like fainting really don't suit your character.

248
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,690
You know that, right?

249
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,336
Who says I was going to faint?

250
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,020
Oh, Jan Di, you came.

251
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,540
But why didn't you come in?

252
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,700
That... uh... that's because...

253
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,580
I was about to come greet you and say thank you.

254
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,060
I came by... just now.

255
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,395
The party was chaotic, right?

256
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:15,130
We were thinking of going on a quiet drive together.

257
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,970
Would you like to come with us then?

258
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,471
Oh, no. It's okay.

259
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,980
We have somewhere else to go.

260
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:28,309
"We?"

261
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:32,215
Yes, both of us were also going to go for a drive.

262
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:35,880
Drive! We're going for a drive.

263
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,550
Then, goodbye.

264
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,530
See you later.

265
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,720
- Let's go.
- Unni.

266
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,307
- I've paid my debt.
- What debt?

267
00:29:58,307 --> 00:29:59,910
Of you saving me at the pool.

268
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:04,981
You want to repay me for saving your life just like that?

269
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,582
Then shall we go back?

270
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,051
Ten percent.

271
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:10,454
Let's say it's ten percent paid.

272
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:11,955
Fifty.

273
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:13,623
Twenty-five.

274
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:30,350
This is nice.

275
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:34,811
But why aren't there any customers?

276
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,840
I sent them away.

277
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,183
Why?

278
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:44,110
I rented it out til the morning, so do whatever you want.

279
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,119
Do whatever I want, what?

280
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,550
Yell or cry.

281
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,190
If you want to hit someone, do you want me to call Mr. Portly on standby outside?

282
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,320
Well...

283
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,630
Why do I have to do that?

284
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:03,020
Didn't you have a heartbreak after seeing Ji Hoo and Seo Hyun?

285
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,543
What? No way!

286
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:12,181
Someone like me can't compete with Min Seo Hyun, right?

287
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:16,510
I'm not pretty, and not smart either.

288
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,250
And I come from a poor family.

289
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,140
And your figure is mediocre, and your character sucks too.

290
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,030
That's right!

291
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:30,680
How could a girl like me dare to be jealous of Min Seo Hyun?

292
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:35,171
I didn't have a chance against her from the beginning.

293
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:37,900
Even though there are lots of bad things about you,

294
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,910
there are still some good things.

295
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,150
You have potential.

296
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:51,121
What?

297
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:59,140
I'm certain that, if Ji Hoo had met you first,

298
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,290
he would have fallen for you.

299
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:07,470
Seriously?

300
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,800
Looks, brains, and background may not be much,

301
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,390
but you're the first girl I've approved of.

302
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:20,049
Full of potential.

303
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,648
Hang on, I need to go use the restroom.

304
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,620
♫ Wish Ur my love ♫

305
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,740

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,040
It's warm.

00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,590
Isn't it warm? It's warm. I'm thirsty.

310
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,820
Water.

311
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,870
♫ Does love have to be said to know? ♫

312

316
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:25,510
Man, what the heck?

317
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:37,646
Hey, Dry Cleaner!

318
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:42,060
Hey! Wake up!

319
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:46,021
What's wrong with her?

320
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:48,790
Well, it's because of that.

321
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:56,799
She drank all of it?

322
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,360
Yes.

Yeah, I'm a woman.

and my brains are all crap.

329
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,240
I know that.

330
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,310
Even without you pointing that out,

331
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:34,600
I feel it in my bones every day, you jerk!

332
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,239
What? Jerk?

333
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,320
No, no.

334
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:49,440
I don't have time to waste on things like this.

And for tuition, I have to swim so I can get a scholarship.

Hey, gangster! Wake up!

You're the enemy!

Fine, I'll let this go because I feel like it.

I'm saying that I'll cut in half what you owe to your savior!

Thank you for saving me today, Goo Joon Pyo.

I know this is a really expensive room just by smelling it.

356
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,319
You have the sense of smell of a hunting dog.

You're here because I brought you here.

You don't remember?

361
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:13,560
This suit just came from Milan two days ago,

362
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,530
and was designed by the famous designer Ermenegildo Zegna

as one of his new works for this spring/summer collection.

What's that got to do with me?

369

It was the first time I wore that suit,

He is upstairs.

I'll bet $3,000 that she will send him to Sejong Antarctic Research Center.

401
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:14,900
Rather than that, she'll probably hire an assassin first.

482
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,278
We are starting the bidding at $10,000.

483
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:12,320
Yes, we have $10,000!

484
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,817
Do we have $15,000?

485
00:49:15,817 --> 00:49:17,953
Yes, we have $15,000!

486
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:21,670
Next up, we have an item by Designer Marie,

487
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,570
the striped suit that touched the hearts of many!

488
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:27,320
Do we have $20,000?

489
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,898
Yes, we have $20,000!

490
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:32,468
Wow, we are getting a tremendous response!

491
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:34,920
As expected, a suit like this

492
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,530
exudes class even through small details like the buttons.

493
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,900
You can feel the handmade quality of a craft master.

494
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,300
Do we have $25,000?

495
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,370
Oh! $25,000! Yes!

496
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,310
Wow! Great!

497
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,686
This one's Shinhwa group's Goo Joon Pyo's Fabio's Suit.

498
00:49:50,686 --> 00:49:53,555
What are you doing? Hurry up, it's your turn now!

499
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:57,910
[Auctioneer speaking]

500
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,790
Now, we have gone as far as 20 million, 5 million won. Do you have 30 million won?

501
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,000
30 million won, we have 30 million won now.

502
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,903
Yes. The next auction item is very dazzling.

503
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:10,272
- I can't do that! Please! Please!
- You can do it!

504
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:13,008
I can't! I can't!

505
00:50:42,805 --> 00:50:49,378
Yes. The light yellow tint and the lemon-like color will uplift the wearer's glamour.

506
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:54,783
The gold spangles and beads stress the luxury of the item.

507
00:50:54,783 --> 00:51:00,655
We are starting the bid for this Bella Song dress at $10,000.

508
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:02,940
Yes, we have $10,000!

509
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,360
Do we have higher bids? $15,000?

510
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,690
Yes, we have 1500 million won now!

511
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:10,798
How is Joon Pyo doing these days?

512
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:13,268
He has been very quiet.

513
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:14,990
He is even attending school well.

514
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,630
It's balzing now!

515
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:19,840
Do you know that student?

516
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,770
A brand new dress!

517
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,081
You can transform beautifully!

518
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:28,700
So I finally meet the famous Wonder Girl.

519
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,570
It's nice to meet you.

520
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:35,590
I didn't push him. Really, I—

521
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,125
Mr. Jung.

522
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,527
Yes?

523
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,498
I know that she is a student of Shin Hwa High School.

524
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,670
- Find out whose daughter she is.
- Yes, Madam.

525
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:55,544
This dress will add to your sophistication.

526
00:51:55,544 --> 00:51:57,950
Now, the item that was extremely popular

527
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,210
in Paris Haute Couture this season.

528
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:09,657
Are they real? Are these really the goggles that Pak Tae Hwan used?

529
00:52:11,858 --> 00:52:16,680
It's not a joke. Noona, noona, big news!

530
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,068
This is big news.

531
00:52:20,068 --> 00:52:22,569
- Now what?
- Park Tae Hwan's goggles!

532
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:26,074
If you sell them, you can get at least $2,000!

533
00:52:26,074 --> 00:52:29,530
$2,000? $2,000 for goggles?

534
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:33,880
Sell them! We have to sell them. Where can you find $2,000?

535
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:36,884
No way! They're worth so much more.

536
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:44,010
What I'm saying is

537
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:49,200
this is one of those things that you can't put a price on.

538
00:52:49,931 --> 00:52:52,180
Sell it. $2,000 is $2,000.

539
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:57,250
I would understand if it were just $20. What's wrong with you?

540
00:52:58,272 --> 00:53:02,300
But still, if we sell them... It's kind of...

541
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,614
Ah. I don't know.

542
00:53:06,614 --> 00:53:08,851
Good night.

543
00:53:10,775 --> 00:53:13,780
- Hey! You little...!
- Hey!

544
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,420
Hey! You!

545
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,850
I'm going now.

546
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,189
Anyway, thanks.

547
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:58,195
What? I can't hear you!

548
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:01,725
- I said, thank you.
- What?

549
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:04,140
I said, thank you!

550
00:54:04,762 --> 00:54:08,690
Just a plain "thank you" would've sufficed.

551
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,400
For a commoner, you have a very big pride.

552
00:54:11,403 --> 00:54:15,510
- That's it. I take it back!
- What?

553
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,200
I'm taking back the thank you!

554
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:21,690
What was I thinking? People don't change that easily.

555
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,780
I'm leaving.

556
00:54:24,581 --> 00:54:27,790
- Hey, Jan Di Baht (field of grass).
- What!

557
00:54:28,952 --> 00:54:32,890
You... don't drink when I'm not around.

558
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,890
♫ It's a yearning heart, it's a yearning heart ♫

559
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:45,350
♫ Even at your side, I'm always longing for you ♫

582
00:57:37,907 --> 00:57:39,820
Seo Hyun Unni?

583
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,070
What brings you here?

584
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:47,450
I had to take care of something regarding my dropping out of school.

585
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:51,940
I wanted to see you one more time before I left.

586
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,620
What a relief.

587
00:57:53,624 --> 00:57:55,980
Dropping out of school?

588
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,520
You're really not going to come back?

589
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,110
Perhaps.

590
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:05,300
When are you leaving?

591
00:58:05,303 --> 00:58:07,250
Tomorrow.

592
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,820
So soon?

593
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:18,960
I still haven't been able to say thank you.

594
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,870
I haven't even returned the favor.

595
00:58:23,787 --> 00:58:28,026
If you keep saying things like that, then I'm going to be sad.

596
00:58:31,864 --> 00:58:34,960
I knew from the moment I saw you,

597
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:42,770
that it was you whom Ji Hoo talked about with a smile on his face.

598
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:30,988
Um... Unni.

599
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,067
Jan Di, what are you doing?

600
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:51,870
I was a fan of yours way before I even met you.

601
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:57,880
So, that's why I know better than anyone why you made this kind of decision.

602
00:59:57,881 --> 00:59:59,595
But...

603
01:00:02,418 --> 01:00:04,970
I'm begging you,

604
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,320
please don't leave.

605
01:00:09,225 --> 01:00:11,480
Please stand up.

606
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,930
I know that I have no right

607
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:18,780
to make this kind of request and that you have no reason to listen to me,

608
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,637
but if I don't even try...

609
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:25,131
Is this because of Ji Hoo?

610
01:00:31,136 --> 01:00:35,440
I don't know anything about Ji Hoo Sunbae,

611
01:00:36,751 --> 01:00:38,410
but,

612
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,420
I do know how much

613
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,960
he cares about you.

614
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:59,660
And for some reason, I can see the sad look in his eyes.

615
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,670
But, there are times when he does smile.

616
01:01:05,014 --> 01:01:09,600
He smiles so warmly that whoever is watching him

617
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,680
feels that warmth.

618
01:01:14,757 --> 01:01:18,540
The only person who can make him smile is you.

619
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:23,150
If you leave like this,

620
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:27,100
he may never smile again.

621
01:01:34,307 --> 01:01:36,278
Please stand up.

622
01:01:47,822 --> 01:01:49,870
Jan Di,

623
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,470
to me, when a person tries to decide what to do,

624
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:59,480
it's similar to buying something in a foreign country.

625
01:02:00,502 --> 01:02:05,580
If you don't buy it at that very moment, then there's no second chance.

626
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:12,080
I know very well how agonizing that regret is.

627
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:20,610
Ji Hoo is an important person to me.

628
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:24,510
And I also believe that I am to him as well.

629
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:28,700
That's why I don't believe that

630
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,900
he would want me to regret my decision.

631
01:02:33,169 --> 01:02:35,738
What do you think?

632
01:02:38,308 --> 01:02:40,500
I'm sorry.

633
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,330
I'm very sorry.

634
01:02:44,545 --> 01:02:46,380
No.

635
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,820
I'm really happy you said those things.

636
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:54,080
Thank you.

637
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:56,859
Unni...

638
01:02:56,859 --> 01:02:58,593
Oh, hang on.

639
01:03:06,101 --> 01:03:09,740
Are these for me?

640
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:14,330
As I told you, shoes are of the utmost importance.

641
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:20,438
I'll pray that these shoes take you to great places without fail.

642
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:27,550
I also have a request for you.

643
01:03:28,022 --> 01:03:30,240
Please, make Ji Hoo...

644
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,230
smile again.

645
01:03:55,884 --> 01:03:57,760
Who do you think you are?

646
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:01,100
Who are you to say those things?

647
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:04,760
Who asked you to make that kind of request?

648
01:04:05,418 --> 01:04:08,760
No, not a request... to beg?

649
01:04:09,764 --> 01:04:12,160
Don't you have any pride?

650
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:16,200
It's not because I don't have any pride.

651
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:22,660
It's because you're in such agony.

652
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:25,640
Because you looked like you would die of sadness.

653
01:04:25,648 --> 01:04:28,040
What's it to you?

654
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:32,320
It has nothing to do with you!

655
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:37,194
Get lost.

656
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:47,880
♫ Shout to the world, "I love you..." ♫

657
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,950
♫ "...I love you, be my woman" ♫

658
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:55,600
♫ You are blinding. Always you're my star ♫

659
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,350
♫ I'll protect you ♫

660
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:03,850
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

661
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:06,150
What it means to be a real man?

662
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:09,840
A real man is responsible from the beginning to the end.

663
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,270
Geum Jan Di... You and I...

664
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:15,270
It can't be. No way!

665
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,980
Mom and Dad, I've committed a great sin.

666
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,820
The heir of Shinhwa Group.

667
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:28,350
I'm on the next flight. I'm glad to have met a girl... like you.

668
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:33,180
Freedom to us is limited to dating only. You haven't forgotten that it's your parents...

669
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,300
who make the final decision, right?

670
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,470
Were you just talking when you guys said you were men?

671
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:41,240
Goo Joon Pyo from F4? Is it true?

672
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:45,600
You cheating on Goo Joon Pyo Sunbae is the same as cheating on all of us.

673
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,610
Geum Jan Di...

674
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,980
from now on, I don't know you anymore.

675
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,240
♫ You are blinding. Always you're my star ♫

676
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,030
♫ I'll protect you ♫

677
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:02,400
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

678
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:09,390
♫ Why did you come only now?
Feels like I have the whole world ♫

679
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:13,200
♫ Thank you, my angel ♫

680
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,090
♫ I love you just like the first time ♫

681
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:20,530
♫ On the sky I promise you ♫

682
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:24,720
♫ I want to have everything of yours ♫

683
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,940
♫ Shout to the world, "I love you..." ♫

684
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,970
♫ "...I love you, be my woman" ♫

685
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:37,650
♫ You are blinding. Always you're my star ♫

686
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:41,430
♫ I'll protect you ♫

687
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:45,840
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

688
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:49,520
♫ Let's make one promise ♫

689
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,820
♫ Let's swear on the sky ♫

690
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:57,630
♫ Till the day that the sun runs out of light,
let's love each other. Oh my love ♫
