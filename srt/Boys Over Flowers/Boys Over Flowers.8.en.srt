[Episode 8]

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,802
Where are you going this late?

8
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:32,471
I'm going to practice. Why?

9
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:34,570
Do you want to win that badly?

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,170
We don't have any other choice.

11
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:40,710
"We?"

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,119
Why does it have to be Ji Hoo?

13
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:52,258
If it just weren't Ji Hoo...

Goo Joon Pyo.

15
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:03,802
It's not too late.

16
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:08,050
Just say it once.

17
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:12,480
Say that you like me,

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,880
just once.

19
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:33,450
Sorry.

20
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:36,100
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:47,490
Do you know what you're doing right now?

22
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,550
The great Goo Joon Pyo

23
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,660
is begging you.

24
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,130
I can't help it.

25
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,300
How did I end up liking a girl like you?

26
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,790
You just lost your last chance.

27
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,170
It doesn't matter how much you cry tomorrow,

28
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,560
because I'm not going to watch after you anymore.

29
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,900
I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,800
Right.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,210
That's more like you, Geum Jan Di.

32
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,520
Fine.

33
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,690

I won't regret it.

39
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,850
I'll never regret this.

40
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:47,890
If they lose, Ji Hoo will be kicked out of F4

41
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,700
and Geum Jan Di will be expelled from school.

42
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,739
What if they win?

43
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,009
Don't be stupid. Did you perhaps bet on them?

44
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,044
No!

45
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,880
Only a crazy person would bet on them.

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,584
But what if they were to win by some kind of miracle? I could hit the jackpot.

47
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:08,453
Gambling is not a miracle.

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,160
Oppa!

49
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:26,105
Now, we're going to start the last competition.

00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:28,610

Song Woo Bin! Song Woo Bin! Song Woo Bin!

55
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,755
Hey! Geum Jan Di, it's the end for you!

56
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,693
YiJung sunbae, fighting!

57
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:27,626
Justice always prevails!

58
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,670
Jan Di, stay strong!

59
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,370
A little bit more, a little bit more!

60
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,470
So Yi Jung! So Yi Jung! So Yi Jung!

61
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,720
So Yi Jung! So Yi Jung! So Yi Jung!

62
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,090
So Yi Jung!

63
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,810
So Yi Jung! So Yi Jung!

Who made it? Who won?

65
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,549
- Did you see it?
- No, I didn't.

66
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:59,684
Who won?

67
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:01,153
Of course it should be Yi Jung senior.

68
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:04,321
Who did that?!

69
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:26,044
So, it looks like Jan Di and Ji Hoo won't be getting expelled.

70
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:28,013
No complaints, right?

71
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,350
You looked cool.

72
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,690
Thank you.

73
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,026
- I should be the one saying that.
- Huh?

74
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:45,720
Because of a certain someone, my younger brother is becoming a good man.

75
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,001
Then, see you later.

76
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,890
I'm so relieved!

77
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,410
Geum Jan Di.

78
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,581
You are good competition.

79
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:04,370
You too.

80
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,190
I'm going to go see Joon Pyo.

81
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,847
- Thank You.
- Thank You.

82
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,854
- Because of you I...
- Because of you I...

83
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:48,850
Geum Jan Di.

84
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:54,967
Do you want to go on a date with me?

85
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,550
Goo Joon Pyo.

86
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,080
You have greatly repaid your debt.

87
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,961
Why are you talking to yourself like a crazy person?

88
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:26,040
He must still be in shock.

89
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,790
You guys...

90
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,005
Do you remember when I broke Ji Hoo's robot in preschool?

91
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,670
Robot?

92
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,270
The one that's made of wood?

93
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,900
That's right.

94
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,026
Ji Hoo, give this to me.

95
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,361
No way!

96
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:03,030
Give it to me, and I'll give you all my toys.

97
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,465
Not that one, Joon Pyo!!

98
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,470
What do you mean? There is no such thing as "no way".

99
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,510
It's mine now.

100
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,246
It was a handmade gift from his dad who passed away.

101
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,990
Ever since that time,

102
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,960
I've always thought I was in debt to him.

103
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,166
So you've repaid your debt after this?

104
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,000
Geum Jan Di.

105
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,930
I can't destroy her so that no one can have her.

106
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,230
Man...

107
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,130
Joon Pyo!

108
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:04,260
Do you want to go on a date with me? Go on a date with me?

109
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,494
Date?

110
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,510
Jan Di!

111
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:18,892
I'm just... going out for some fresh air! And some exercise!

112
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,094
In those clothes?

113
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,868
Actually, you're going on a date with Ji Hoo hyungnim, right?

114
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:30,437
- How did you know?
- It's too bad that you hurt Joon Pyo.

115
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:34,441
But love doesn't always go as planned.

116
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,710
That's right. That's right.

117
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,315
No matter what the route is, the whole point is to get to the right destination.

118
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,000
What does that mean?

119
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,420
So, what that means is,

120
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,070
you have to look good in front of Young Master Ji Hoo.

121
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,490
Noona, isn't that dress too long?

122
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,590
Couldn't you make it sexier?

123
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:59,433
Jan Di, your lips are too dry. Why don't you lick your lips like this?

124
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,370
Ew, you're disguisting.

125
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,440
Jan Di, how a woman smells is very important.

126
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,740
You know, the irresistible fragrance of temptation!

127
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,978
Oh, please!

128
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,690
I'm going now.

129
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:21,928
What else is there?

130
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:25,190
- Soo Am Culture Center.
- Real Barcelona!

131
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,128
LA Dolphins!

132
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,233
The former president's granddaughter-in-law?

133
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,281
Do you know what time it is? Let's get out of here.

134
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,450
- I don't want to.
- Yo!

135
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,151
- Yo, go for a shooting?
- No.

136
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,721
- Drive!
- Such a bother!

137
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:58,010
- What about shopping?
- I don't care.

138
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,540
The weather's beautiful, but you are gonna stay stuck at home?

139
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,504
Ji Hoo is probably enjoying his date right now.

140
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,410
But... Ji Hoo and Geum Jan Di...

141
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,980
What would they do together? I really can't imagine.

142
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,200
Right.

143
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,284
They might just go somewhere sunny and take a nap there.

144
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,387
With her head on his arm?

145
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,529
Hey! Let's go outside.

146
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,580
Let's go!

147
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,530
Stop!

148
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,660
Seo Hyun got me Rui for my first Christmas present.

149
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,760
She gave you a horse, as a present?

150
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:14,610
When I was young,

151
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,430
I went on a hunger strike for four days to get a puppy.

152
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,140
How did it end?

153
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,120
I got the sense beaten out of me.

154
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,000
How about a horse instead of a puppy?

155
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:52,160
♫ I keep smelling a familiar fragrance in the air ♫

156
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,320
♫ The breeze that brushed off you ♫

157
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:05,010
♫ Is passing by me now ♫

158
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,110
♫ In my heart ♫

159
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,420
♫ Perhaps there's only the sunlight that shines you ♫

160
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,730
♫ Even pain and wounds are embraced ♫

161
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:26,500
♫ Love you, I think of you now ♫

162
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,060
♫ I close my eyes again ♫

163
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,340
♫ I love you, if I could fill your two eyes ♫

164
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,410
♫ I love you, if you show me your smile ♫

165
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,100
♫ Even the starlight there ♫

166
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,700

00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:02,044
You crazy bastard.

328
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:26,502
You. That was a bit too much of a strategy.

329
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:28,037
Why didn't you say anything sooner?

330
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:30,372
He had a debt to pay.

That punk broke my robot.

332

Cheap things look good on you.

333
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,947
Don't lose it just because it's cheap, or I'll kill you.

This can't be.

349
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:47,035
It's a lie, right?

350
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:49,037
Why, all of a sudden?

351

What happened?

Why are you lying there?

I have lots of things to tell you.

And to fight with you about.

What are you doing?!

He was so gloomy all day and all of a sudden he said he had to apologize to you.

362
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:52,367
I am the one who should apologize.

the last time.

366

Oh my, who is this?

00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,176
Isn't it Geum Jan Di?

434
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,678
Why are you here?

435
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,700
- Do you know her?
- No.

436
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,710
But, what's that?

437
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:16,620
Oh! That smell!

438
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,522
Did she come here to collect this rubbish?

439
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:23,459
What to do? You're going to eat the leftovers?

440
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:26,830
How pitiful!

441
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,430
Do you want to wait a while more?

442
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:31,930
When we're done eating, you can have our leftovers.

443
00:48:34,237 --> 00:48:36,272
What are you guys doing?

444
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,991
Why are you still here?

445
00:48:54,991 --> 00:48:57,094
Joon Pyo! Long time no see!

446
00:48:57,094 --> 00:48:59,429
Do you have a new taste in women?

447
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:03,400
What is she? Your maid?

448
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:07,600
Do you want to shut up nicely?

449
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,576
Or would you like to read the news tomorrow morning about your company going under?

450
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:13,810
I was wrong.

451
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,712
Not to me.

452
00:49:22,152 --> 00:49:25,488
Excuse me, please forgive me.

453
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:52,080
What should I do? I can't even swallow my saliva naturally.

454
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:56,085
How should I start so that it seems normal?

455
00:49:56,085 --> 00:49:58,655
Why is it so hot?

456
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:01,625
If I take my jacket off she's going to have a fit.

457
00:50:02,525 --> 00:50:04,461
Aishh, really!

458
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:12,802
All of a sudden, why is it this kind of scene?

459
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:16,475
Goo Joon Pyo! Do it now!

460
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:17,542
Turn your head!

461
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:19,290
No!

462
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,350
Don't look at me, please!

463
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:26,315
Goo Joon Pyo, if you turn toward me, you're so dead!

464
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,690
I can't do it!

465
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,420
I'll just have some popcorn.

466
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:09,860
Answer your call!

467
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,650
Answer your call!

468
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:20,670
Answer your call!

469
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,040
- Hello?
- Jan Di!

470
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,170
Geum Jan Di!

471
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,840
- Eat a lot, honey.
- You too!

472
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,884
- Honey!
- I'm home.

473
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,900
Mom, this eel is really soft.

474
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,360
Honey, this is eel.

475
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,696
The stamina food eel, eel.

476
00:51:46,696 --> 00:51:48,632
Where did all of this come from?

477
00:51:48,632 --> 00:51:51,368
Why do you always ask the obvious?

478
00:51:51,368 --> 00:51:53,581
Joon Pyo hyungnim ordered all of this.

479
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:56,139
The head chef brought this here in person!

480
00:51:56,139 --> 00:51:59,676
The head chef brought this here personally!
He brought this huge tuna fish and prepared it on the spot!

481
00:51:59,676 --> 00:52:03,780
I thought the tuna was a whale!

482
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,516
Hurry up and eat! Eat a lot!

483
00:52:06,516 --> 00:52:10,880
Honey, let's eat and die today!

484
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,930
Let's eat and die today!

485
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,060
Give it to Dad, give it to Dad.

486
00:52:53,235 --> 00:52:57,673
I'm saying this beforehand because you might get mad again, but I didn't give those to you.

487
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,948
Don't eat even one slice of it.

488
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:29,539
So, I'm walking and someone taps my shoulder.

489
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,607
And then?

490
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:35,444
"Do you want to watch a movie with me?"

491
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:38,447
That's so cheesy!

492
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:45,420
Jan Di, is something wrong?

493
00:53:47,356 --> 00:53:48,858
[Goo Joon Pyo]

494
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:56,230
Hello? Oh, Goo Joon Pyo!

495
00:53:57,967 --> 00:53:59,235
I can't hear you.

496
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,304
I'm at the porridge shop. I'm very busy!

497
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:02,872
There are so many customers!

498
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,074
Can I have a porridge over here?

499
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:06,613
Yes! I got it!

500
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:10,610
Did you hear that? I'm very, very, very busy right now so I have to work late.

501
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,790
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

502
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:22,416
Jan Di, what porridge shop were you talking about?

503
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:25,827
Hey, can you give me some more kimchi!

504
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:28,498
Please, hold on.

505
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:10,700
Ji Hoo sunbae!

506
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:22,784
Thank you!

507
00:55:22,784 --> 00:55:24,586
It's warm.

508
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:27,522
You practice during break too?

509
00:55:27,522 --> 00:55:29,042
Just because.

510
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:31,160
It didn't seem just because.

511
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,980
I thought it was a training center for Olympic athletes.

512
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:37,667
Swimming makes me feel better, it's all.

513
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,370
Is something wrong?

514
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,457
Sunbae, what about you? Why did you come back to school?

515
00:55:46,457 --> 00:55:48,878
I left some sheet music here.

516
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,251
Oh, Joon Pyo!

517
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:58,157
Me?

518
00:55:58,157 --> 00:56:01,224
I'm at school. Here, Geum—

519
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,861
All right then. I'll wait.

520
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:09,732
I got it.

521
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:14,503
Joon Pyo said he was on his way.

522
00:56:14,503 --> 00:56:16,672
If you wait, you can see him.

523
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:18,474
Okay.

524
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:22,277
But why...

525
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:25,920
I'm really busy today and I have to hurry back home,

526
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,131
I forgot.

527
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:31,853
Sunbae, I'll see you later. Thanks for the coffee.

528
00:56:42,331 --> 00:56:44,533
What? There was someone with you?

529
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:46,740
Huh? No.

530
00:56:50,391 --> 00:56:52,280
Eh? It's all cold!

531
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,686
Starting with soft ribs, raw meat...

532
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:03,986
It looks so delicious.

533
00:57:03,986 --> 00:57:07,189
Expensive food spoiled our taste.

534
00:57:07,189 --> 00:57:09,092
Isn't noona going on any dates?

535
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,764
RIght.

536
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,271
It would be nice if it was a Chinese restaurant this time, right?

537
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:16,666
They should go to an Italian restaurant. Have something special.

538
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:19,660
That's right. What are those? Those snails.

539
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,070
Escargot!

540
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,340
That's French cuisine.

541
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,550
Who is it?

542
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:39,220
Who is it?

543
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,360
If they came to get the bill back, tell them your parents aren't here.

544
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,695
G.. G...

545
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:49,297
They came to pick up the plates? Did you guys order something while I was gone?

546
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:51,367
J, Joo...

547
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:54,136
If it's the landlord, tell him that your parents have passed away.

548
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:57,874
Joon Pyo... Joon Pyo hyungnim!

549
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,575
What?

550
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:12,589
Sh... Shinhwa!

551
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:16,158
Young master!

552
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,397
Will it be alright if I come in?

553
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,920
Why are you here at such a late hour?

554
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,650
What do you mean late? It's only 10.

555
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,180
It's just early evening.

556
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,194
- Father.
- "Father?"

557
00:58:53,194 --> 00:58:56,630
Honey, did you hear that? He called me father.

558
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,936
And, Mother.

559
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:02,671
Oh, Honey.

560
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,876
Please let me stay over for the night.

561
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,379
What?

562
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:12,247
What did he just say?

563
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:13,560
You've lost your mind, right?

564
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,886
Why would you leave your good house and sleep at mine? Who said you could?

565
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,487
I said!

566
00:59:18,487 --> 00:59:20,456
- No, I said!
- Mom!

567
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:24,293
It's so late at night, of course you have to sleep here!

568
00:59:24,293 --> 00:59:28,489
It's already past ten! Where are you going to go this late at night?

569
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:31,533
Hyungnim, you can sleep with me!

570
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,068
No way!

571
00:59:39,808 --> 00:59:43,979
It's a bit too short, but they still look good!

572
00:59:43,979 --> 00:59:49,560
Oh my, no matter what you wear, you look like a model!

573
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,860
Don't you think this style will be the new fashion?

574
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,796
I'm done with the preparations!

575
01:00:01,796 --> 01:00:04,880
Preparations? What preparations?

576
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,505
- Tada!
- Honey, isn't that our

577
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:13,120
first night on our honeymoon.

578
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,620
First night.

579
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,370
We just slept.

580
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:20,950
Mom!

581
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:51,113
Goo Joon Pyo, are you really going to do this?

582
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:55,383
- I didn't think about it before coming here, but this is really interesting.
- What?

583
01:00:55,383 --> 01:00:57,520
How can the main room be smaller than the toilet in my house?

584
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,955
The toilet at your house is abnormal!

585
01:01:00,955 --> 01:01:04,392
The highlight is that we are going to sleep like this, with five people in one room.

586
01:01:04,392 --> 01:01:06,095
No one's gonna believe this.

587
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:07,196
Are you having fun?

588
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,830
Isn't it fun?

589
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:12,635
Then continue to enjoy. Just don't regret it later.

590
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,190
Regret what?

591
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,370
It feels like I'm experiencing a refugee's life. How thrilling.

592
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:21,076
I'm going to sleep. If you talk again, you're dead.

593
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,070
Still,

594
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:29,680
with everyone sleeping under the same blanket, doesn't it feel like a family?

595
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:37,426
Hey, dry cleaner, are you sleeping?

596
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:43,670
Are you really going to sleep first?

597
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:48,401
- Hey, dry cleaner!
- Dry cleaners! Dry cleaners!

598
01:01:48,401 --> 01:01:54,460
Jan Di's Dry Cleaners is here!

599
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:59,360
Escargots, bird's nest...

600
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:03,885
Sweet and sour pork is good too!

601
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:20,100
Honey!

602
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,200
Sweet and sour pork...

603
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:29,860
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

604
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:34,080
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

605
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,430
♫ "I love you" plays on my mouth ♫

606
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:42,680
♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

607
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,650
♫ Alone again, missing for you ♫

608
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,340
Where did all this come from?

609
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,730
Why do you always ask the obvious?

610
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,900
Let's eat this and die!

611
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:59,040
Hello? Oh Goo Joon Pyo!

612
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,840
I can't hear you. I'm at the porridge shop. I'm very busy!

613
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,280
There are so many customers!

614
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,860
Please let me stay over for the night.

615
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:13,120
No matter what you wear, you look like a model!

616
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,750
Don't you think this style will be the new fashion?

617
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,960
Where is he?

618
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,930
I'm asking you why Joon Pyo isn't around!

619
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:24,450
Please don't look here, Goo Joon Pyo.

620
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,950
If you turn toward me, you're so dead!

621
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,110
Goo Joon Pyo...

622
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,710
Do it now!

623
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,720
♫ On the days that my chest hurts and it's sad ♫
