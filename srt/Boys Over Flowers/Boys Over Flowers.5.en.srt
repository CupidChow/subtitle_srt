163
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:12,294
The Young Master left early in the morning.

164
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:14,196
Where did he go?

165
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,233
Is that you, noona?

166

[Goo Joon Pyo]

167
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,810
[World's youngest rich people]

168
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,420
Is your sister back?

169
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,870
Goo... Goo...

170
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,360
What's wrong? I asked you if your older sister has come back.

171
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,040
This little guy is even stuttering now.

172
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,630
Didn't I tell you to be careful of the electromagnetic waves?

173
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:55,280
- F... F...
- What?

174
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,709
What's this? Wow, whose son is this? He's very good looking.

175
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,443
- He's here.
- What?

176
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:03,036
"F4!"

177
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:04,379
What's that?

178
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:06,815
Shinhwa Group successor, Goo Joon Pyo!

179
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:08,984
Shinhwa Group?

180
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:13,822
What? This guy? He's here? At our house?

181
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:23,566
Honey!

182
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,920
It's useless to call for me that anxiously.

183
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,470
We only have one piece of cutlass fish.

184
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:57,465
You eat this as a side dish?

185
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:22,024
What kind of bug is this?

186
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:25,710
It's not a bug, but a fish.

187
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:28,730
What kind of fish is this small?

188
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,880
It's called "anchovy."

189
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,937
Ah, I guess you haven't heard of it before.

190
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:41,110
I didn't know what rich young masters eat.

191
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,930
So, at least eat this for now.

192
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:49,918
I know this. This is kal...

193
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:57,500
Kal... chi?
(T/N: a type of fish used as side dish)

194
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,610

How did you know?

196
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,030
Yes.

197
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:19,847
That's not how you eat it.

198
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,730
- This looks fine.
- Where did they get it done?

199
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,070
They did it so well.

[Addicted to plastic surgery... Oh Min Ji's ugly past revealed]

204
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:52,714
Jan Di, how could Oh Min Ji do this to you?

205
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:56,185
There's just a line you shouldn't cross, even when stabbing someone in the back.

206
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:59,690
I mean, who did you go through all that pain for?

207
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,020
Look at her.

208
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:06,530
So scary. She is so incredibly vicious.

209
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:12,550
They say plastic surgery is so painful,

210
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,200
you wouldn't want to do it again after doing it once.

211
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,610
It's no wonder she's so pretty, with the number of times she's had plastic surgery done.

212
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:25,814
Does she even look human anymore?

213
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,470
If I looked like that, then I would've committed suicide already.

214
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,190
That was a bit too harsh!

215
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,220
Was it?

They're all bought with money, right?

219
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,147
If you want something, don't you buy it with money?

220
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:59,780
But can you buy beauty?

221
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:05,440
All of you have had plastic surgery done,

222
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,950
so why are you talking crap about Min Ji?

223
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:12,590
So, it's okay for an already beautiful person to become prettier,

224
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,810
but it's unsightly for an ugly person to do it?

225
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:18,720
It's not something you get for free,

226
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,670
it's something that you get after going through unspeakable pain.

227
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,050
So what? What's wrong with that?

228
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,613
Can anyone say that Min Ji doesn't have the right?

About asking you for forgiveness...

232
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:02,245
I won't do it.

233
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,093
I can't even say

00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:19,096
"I'm sorry".

235
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:27,004
Don't delude yourself into thinking I'll ever forgive you.

Everyone, listen up!

00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:41,970
Under the name of Shinhwa School's F4, I have something to announce.

246
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:45,880
I am officially announcing that, from today onwards,

247
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,180
Geum Jan Di from 2nd year class B, is Goo Joon Pyo's girlfriend.

248
00:26:04,927 --> 00:26:07,496
Listen up!

249
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:12,630
So from now on, doing something against Geum Jan Di

250
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:18,240
is the same as doing something against Goo Joon Pyo.

251
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,280
All of you, don't even try. Is that clear?

252
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,670
Yes!

253
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:25,681
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

254
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:28,351
I object to that decision.

255
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:34,825
Jihoo!

256
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:41,931
I'm back.

257
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:55,576
But, isn't it too early for that prince to return?

258
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,390
But the fact is that he returned.

259
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,810
Doesn't that mean that there's a red light on the situation over there?

260
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,754
Maybe.

261
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:09,658
If that's true, then shouldn't you be cheering in the bathroom?

262
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:11,580
Maybe not.

263
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:15,732
You can't now because of Mr. Goo or the leader or whatever, right?

264
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:17,801
It's not like that...

265
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:21,771
Then why do you look so down?

266
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:26,276
I don't know. I can't really say it's because of one thing, but...

267
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:29,012
I have this weird feeling.

268
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:31,047
What feeling?

269
00:27:32,582 --> 00:27:35,018
Something's changed.

270
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:37,740
Well, that's because he came back from Paris!

271
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,723
Of course, he would become more attractive.

272
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:42,292
That's not it!

273
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:48,431
Geum Kang San.

274
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:50,433
What's the matter?

275
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:55,071
There's an emergency at home.

276
00:27:57,495 --> 00:28:01,250
Mom! Dad!

277
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,479
San, where are you?

278
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:06,049
Noona, I'm here.

279
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:08,090
Dad is here!

280
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,780
Jan Di, come here and take a look at all this.

281
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,757
What is all this?

282
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:16,859
Hyungnim sent all of this.

283
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:18,910
- "Hyungnim?"
- Joon Pyo Hyungnim!

284
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,690
Dining table, couch, TV, kimchi fridge. Nothing's been left out!

285
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,537
As for the beds, they couldn't fit because our doors were too small, so we had to return them.

286
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:32,342
You know, the one with laces all over? The princess bed.

287
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:34,420
What a waste!

288
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,881
We should've accepted it even if we had to bash our doorway!

289
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:40,183
How can you accept it just because they sent it?

290
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:43,290
But Jan Di, I also wanted to refuse.

291
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,890
But, what crime did the delivery people commit?

292
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,191
Those people have to drop off the stuff so they can leave.

293
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:53,096
What do you mean, return it!? It's not like he's just doing all of this for us.

294
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:56,333
He also has his family to think about so he doesn't lose face.

295
00:28:56,333 --> 00:29:02,571
If we live this poorly, then it won't look good on Young Master Joon Pyo either.

296
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:04,575
You should think things through before saying such thoughtless things.

297
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:08,760
That's not it. How are we going to live when there's no room to walk?

298
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,481
Do you want to live between the couch and the fridge?

299
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:16,252
Fine! We'll pack all of this up.

300
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:22,450
We'll send it to your uncle's storage in the country side and use it for your dowry.

301
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,520
Does that work? Huh? Huh?

302
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,362
Dad!

303
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:31,167
Fine, okay. Even if it's a waste, we'll have to return it.

304
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:35,405
Just tell him, so that he understands, that you'll only accept the feelings.

305
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:38,007
I'm not even going to accept that.

306
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:43,779
Noona, can't we at least keep the TV?

307
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:45,915
Geum Kang San!

308
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:07,469
Let's talk!

309
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:09,639
Oh, you really came?

310
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:12,341
What brings you all the way here?

311
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,345
Do you not understand Korean? I said, let's talk!

312
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:18,781
Move. You're not going to move?

313
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,761
What the... What's wrong with this?

314
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,933
I was going to set a new record, but you ruined it!

315
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:38,568
Why are you being like this?

316
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:40,310
Why are you being like this?

317
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,507
Why are you turning someone's house into a moving center without asking?!

318
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:47,010
Ah, that!

319
00:30:47,777 --> 00:30:50,100
Was there something you didn't like?

320
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,740
If so, tell me. I'll just exchange it for you.

321
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:56,653
We already have beds, chairs, a fridge, a washer, and a TV!

322
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,255
But isn't it nice to exchange them for something new?!

323
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,724
But why are you doing the exchange? Who do you think you are?

324
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:03,760
What are you talking about? As of yesterday, I'm your boyfriend!

325
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,910
Do you always do this when you get a girlfriend?

326
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,210
You buy them clothes, a car and change their furniture?

327
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,230
Soon you'll be changing my house!

328
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,260
Actually, I was going to change the house first,

329
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,700
but Chief Jung told me not to, because the dry cleaning business was attached to it.

330
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,178
What do you take me for? Am I Shim Chung, to be sold to you?
(T/N: In a legend, Shim Chung was sold to provide for her family)

331
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:27,197
I told you already. You don't buy friends with money, you make them with your heart.

332
00:31:27,197 --> 00:31:33,055
I told you, you don't buy friends with money, but with your heart!
I don't know what kind of girls you've dated before, but this really annoys me, okay!

333
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:36,492
There weren't any.

334
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:42,765
I haven't dated any girls before.

335
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:47,390
Well...

336
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,776
then it's okay this time. But next time, be more rational!

337
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:57,270
Your temper! Why do you always get mad at me when I'm trying to do something nice for you?

338
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,471
Who asked you to do anything for me?

339
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:05,540
Nice shot! Find the right position and throw it.

340
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,370
You just have to release it like that.

341
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,083
But, do you lounge around like this every day?

342
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:13,285
Why?
Does it worry you?

343
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,390
There's a party today, so this is a special case.

344
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,392
I usually don't let women in.

345
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:22,427
Flies? What flies?
(T/N: homophones with "party")

346
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,830
It's a really good one.

347
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:45,985
What's up with that rascal Ji Hoo?

348
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:50,121
Is he back after becoming a real man in Paris?

349
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:54,293
Seeing how he slept all day like a cat...

350
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:56,830
Now he's a bit more human.

351
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,198
After a long time, I like how he is.

352
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,920
Jan Di, do you want to join our equestrian club?

353
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,180
Jan Di, can you join our group?

354
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,340
Jan Di, today is my birthday party! You have to come!

355
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:22,450
Jan Di!

356
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,580
Look, over there!

357
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,730
Jan Di!

358
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:36,970
This is even scarier than when they were bullying me. Why are they like this?

359
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,338
You don't scream and shout anymore?

360
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:42,143
Sunbae!

361
00:33:47,713 --> 00:33:50,415
I guess old habits do die hard.

362
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:52,920
Things here haven't changed,

363
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,400
but it's weird because it's so quiet.

364
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,280
It doesn't suit it.

365
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:09,430
When are you going back?

366
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:13,290
I'm not going back.

367
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,280
What about you?

368
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,940
Are you really dating Joon Pyo?

369
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,570
That...

370
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:24,960
Looks like it's true.

371
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,820
That… actually...

372
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,656
Am I too late then?

373
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:32,370
What?

374
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:35,970
I was hoping to ask you to go out with me.

375
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,660
What?

376
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,100
I'm kidding.

377
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:50,342
Then how about...

378
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:53,445
we date secretly behind Joon Pyo's back?

379
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:57,150
Sunbae!

380
00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:03,022
It's still the same, the Jan Di baht (lawn grass) over here.

381
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,027
I've missed it.

382
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:01,860
Would you look at that?

383
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:07,060
Who knew picking up a 500 won coin could make you that happy?

384
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:10,556
What are you doing here?

385
00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:15,027
You threw such a fit complaining about how you hated the furniture and the electronics.

386
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:17,263
But with one coin, you're grinning so big your lips can't even close.

387
00:36:17,263 --> 00:36:20,490
That's because it's a lucky—

388
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,036
Wait... Did you drop this?

389
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:28,260
As a reward for your efforts, I threw one to see.

390
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,430
Pretty good results, no?

391
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,378
- Take it.
- You keep it.

392
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:35,081
Didn't you say it was lucky?

393
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:39,419
From the moment I first saw you, my luck has turned bad.

394
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:41,070
No.

395
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,600
Your luck has turned good. Extremely good.

396
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,558
- What?
- Let's go.

397
00:36:46,558 --> 00:36:50,730
Hey? Can you not see that I'm here to work?

398
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,265
It's only for a bit. If you get fired, I'll take responsibility.

399
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:56,420
Can you not mention the whole "taking responsibility" concept?

400
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,500
I get goosebumps just thinking about it.

401
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,000
Man, you talk too much!

402
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,630
- Let's go!
- What? Let me go.

403
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,740
Just get in the car!

404
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:13,520
Jan Di!

405
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,520
Ga Eul, where is Jan Di going?

406
00:37:22,795 --> 00:37:23,829
Make everyone leave.

407
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:26,432
Young Master, if you keep doing this without letting me know...

408
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:28,920
Why would the owner ask permission to do something?

409
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,460
Just shut up and make everyone leave.

410
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:33,280
They said they'll have everyone out by 6pm, if you can just wait 3 hours.

411
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,908
You want me to wait for 3 hours?

412
00:37:35,908 --> 00:37:37,230
I'll tell them again.

413
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,840
Forget it! I'll take care of it myself.

414
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:43,616
Where's that thing?

415
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:47,520
You're talking about "that thing"?

416
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,450
But, what is "that thing"?

417
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,394
- You don't even know what that is?
- Wait a minute, customer!

418
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:59,231
- Start by firing her immediately!
- What?

419
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:11,476
Sir! Sir!

420
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,310
What's this? There's a fire?

421
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,430
♫ Stand by me, look at me ♫

422
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,800
♫ I might not know love yet ♫

423
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,080
♫ Stand by me ♫

424
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,950
I'm not going to wear that!

425
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,490
♫ I think I'm still not good with love ♫

426
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:07,620
♫ Together make it love. Forever make it your smile ♫

427
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,740
♫ Full of your bright smile ♫

428
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,320
♫ Together make it love. Forever make it your smile ♫

429
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,790
♫ Now hold my hand, my hand ♫

430
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,880
♫ Whoa, stand by me, look at me ♫

431
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,550
♫ I might not know love yet ♫

432
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:33,720
♫ Whoa, stand by me, watch over me ♫

433
00:39:35,194 --> 00:39:36,795
Let's go!

434
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:42,400
Do you really have to go this far?

435
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:48,690
I'm on my way, just keep your promise.

436
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,430
The ancient arabesque tea pot.

437
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,090
Don't ask it back, or anything else.

438
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,240
Okay.

439
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,590
Turn the car around.

440
00:40:08,894 --> 00:40:11,240
Why isn't she back?

441
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:19,205
Ga Eul, you can't leave me alone and disappear again.

442
00:40:19,205 --> 00:40:22,808
Where else would I go? Jan Di isn't even here.

443
00:40:22,808 --> 00:40:25,144
Are you really not to go anywhere?

444
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:35,690
Welcome—

445
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,450
What's the matter? I'm not Jan Di, I'm Jan Di's friend, Ga Eul.

446
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,426
Hurry. It's an emergency.

447
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:43,762
What's the matter?

448
00:40:43,762 --> 00:40:46,240
Did something happen to Jan Di?

449
00:40:46,899 --> 00:40:49,130
What happened?

450
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,338
An accident?

451
00:40:52,338 --> 00:40:55,807
If we don't hurry, there's a chance we might not be able to see her. Let's hurry!

452
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:58,140
What to do?

453
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,380
I have to notify her parents.

454
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,530
I've already contacted them.

455
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:12,840
What should I do?

456
00:41:15,261 --> 00:41:16,829
Let's go.

457
00:41:34,113 --> 00:41:36,148
Jan Di!

458
00:41:38,717 --> 00:41:40,770
What's going on?

459
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,888
We're going on a trip.

460
00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:44,323
A trip?

461
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:45,557
Yeah.

462
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:48,794
Impossible! I didn't even tell my parents!

463
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:50,362
I did.

464
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,465
What?

465
00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:55,640
I already got their permission too.

466
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,970
And, just in case they might be concerned with just you going, I brought your friend along too.

467
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,673
It's good now, right?

468
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,378
Impossible!

469
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:10,249
Let's take off!

470
00:42:23,762 --> 00:42:25,264
Hey, the plane changed.

471
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:28,580
They said it would take over a year to get

472
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,135
because the waiting list was so long.

473
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:37,457
Ladies and Gentlemen. We welcome you aboard on Air Shin Hwa Flight 001. From Seoul to New Caledonia.

474
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:42,837
New Caledonia time is 2 hours faster than Seoul. And it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon over there.

475
00:42:42,837 --> 00:42:45,399
Local temperature is 27 degrees Celsius.

476
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,910
Caledonia?

477
00:42:51,104 --> 00:42:53,570
Are you so shocked that you need air?

478
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,470
Shall I get the oxygen mask down for you?

479
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,778
Goo Joon Pyo,

480
00:42:57,778 --> 00:43:00,200
when did we become so close for you to take me on vacation with you?

481
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,530
Even if we were that close, you should have asked me first.

482
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,620
And even matched with my schedule.

483
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,490
Do they not teach that kind of thought process at your Shinhwa kindergarten?

484
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,730
I wanted to go some place nice with you, so I took care of all the preparations.

485
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:16,490
It's not like something will happen to the Republic of Korea if you're not there. So what's the problem?

486
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:21,500
I don't know about the Republic of Korea, but the porridge restaurant...

487
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,500
If he finds out both of us are missing...

488
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,000
We cannot do that. Let's go!

489
00:43:42,355 --> 00:43:44,791
Will you take a seat, please?

490
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:15,640
Seafood porridge is ready!

491
00:44:16,691 --> 00:44:18,510
It's for us.

492
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,040
- We ordered.
- It's for us.

493
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,090
Miss!

494
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,270
Eridanus, Epsilon Indi, Proxima Centauri...

495
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,650
That can't be the beauty of humans. F4! Fighting!

496
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:36,410
Master, four special abalones, please.

497
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,445
Four special abalones?

498
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:40,310
Okay, yes!

499
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,140
Excuse me!

500
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:08,709
This is your captain speaking, We'll be arriving to Metro Island shortly.

501
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:13,313
We wish you a pleasant trip to New Caledonia, French paradise.

502
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,753
We're here! Wake up!

503
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,930
♫ Stand by me, look at me ♫

504
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,320
♫ I might not know love yet ♫

505
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,500
♫ Stand by me, watch over me ♫

506
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,440
♫ I think I'm still not good with love ♫

507
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,630
♫ The more I see you, my mood gets better ♫

508
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:33,020
♫ I sing unknowingly ♫

509
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,270
♫ I want to buy a rose ♫

510
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:41,640
♫ Such a side of myself surprises me ♫

511
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,950
♫ I feel like my heart is going to you ♫

512
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:50,320
♫ This world is beautiful ♫

513
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,690
♫ If you feel this excitement too ♫

514
00:46:54,690 --> 00:47:00,840

00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:22,600

522
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,680

523
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,060

524
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,270

00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,940
♫ Although I'm not able to make the first move ♫

530
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:12,160

534
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,850

535
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:34,100

536
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,660
♫ Although I'm still not good with love ♫

537
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:43,850
I feel like we're floating in the ocean.

538
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:46,859
We are floating.

539
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:48,470
Really?

540
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:50,830
Come here.

541
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:10,183
This can't be.

542
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,756
If there is a heaven, I always thought it would be like this. Where are we again?

543
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:19,180
This is Metro Island.

544
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,960
It's our own personal island and all resorts are ours too.

545
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,930
"Ours?"

546
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,766
Yes, Shinhwa Group's.

547
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:28,368
Woo Bin's family bought an island too, in Dubai.

548
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:31,838
To be more accurate, they bought an artificial island that looks like Korea.

549
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,370
See, those jerks forgot Dokdo, so we decided to make one ourselves.

550
00:49:39,278 --> 00:49:44,350
Since it's everyone's first time, except for the F4, shall we go on a tour of the island?

551
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,310
♫ Yes, yes, yo ♫

552
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,810
♫ Yes, yes, yo ♫

553
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,680
♫ My heart goes bang bang boom when I see you ♫

554
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,330
♫ I stay up all night because of the excitement ♫

555
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:09,280
♫ I style myself up moderately oh yeah ♫

556
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,890
♫ The scooter in which I go to pick you up ♫

557
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:17,100
♫ This road also welcomes you, way ♫

558
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,710
♫ The sun shines over us ♫

559
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,550
♫ I want to confess now ♫

560
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,060
♫ I gather up my courage and say ♫

561
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,210
♫ I love you more than anyone else in this world ♫

562
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:35,410
♫ I want only you ♫

563
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:39,220
♫ I won't hurt you ♫

564
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,550
♫ I want to have only you ♫

565
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,320
♫ Get up, stand up, my heart goes bang bang boom
when I see you ♫

566
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,210
♫ Oh, let it be, excuse me my baby ♫

567
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,590
♫ Lady who captivates me in a second ♫

568
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:54,920
♫ My heart's like a dynamite that'll burst ♫

569
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,620
♫ Oh, get up, bigger, stand up, my heart's fluttering ♫

570
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,450
♫ Oh, the closer I get to you,
the intense my feelings get, bang bang boom ♫

571
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:07,180
♫ The sun shines over us ♫

572
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,010
♫ I want to confess now ♫

573
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,440
♫ I gather up my courage and say ♫

574
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,540
♫ I love you more than anyone else in this world ♫

575
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,760
♫ I want only you ♫

576
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,690
♫ I won't hurt you ♫

577
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,970
♫ I want to have only you ♫

578
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:32,640
♫ Get up, stand up, my heart goes bang bang boom
when I see you ♫

579
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,550
♫ Oh, yes come closer baby ♫

580
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,980
♫ Oh, the lady who's seeing me from there ♫

581
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,230
♫ I was just waiting for you ♫

582
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,000
♫ Oh, get up, come closer, stand up, carefully, come to me ♫

583
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,440
♫ Oh, the closer I get to you, ♫

584
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,700
♫ The intense my feelings get, bang bang boom ♫

585
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:43,600
Give this flower to the one you love.

586
00:52:44,196 --> 00:52:45,640
What?

587
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:52,070
Love?

588
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,310
They are Koreans.

589
00:53:07,163 --> 00:53:08,600
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

590
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,730
What is that?

591
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:14,537
There's a native who seems to be really good at fortune-telling.

592
00:53:14,537 --> 00:53:17,006
- Fortune-telling?
- Yes.

593
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,250
Fortune-telling?

594
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:52,080
I see a man.

595
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,143
Man?

596
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:57,080
Your future husband.

597
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,020
"Husband!"

598
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,300
Husband? Groom? Where?

599
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,150
Where? Who?

600
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,340
Here. With you!

601
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,459
And a soulmate.

602
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:13,562
Soulmate?

603
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:17,020
How great! Your soulmate will be your husband!

604
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,660
It's as perfect as the icing on a cake.

605
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,690
Two different men. Two!

606
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:25,541
What is she saying?

607
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:30,310
So, her soulmate and husband

608
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,980
are two different people?

609
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:34,483
You are losing something important.

610
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:35,885
Losing?

611
00:54:35,885 --> 00:54:38,421
Important?

612
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:40,689
As a woman.

613
00:54:40,689 --> 00:54:45,260
Something important to a woman?

614
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,370
Perhaps...

615
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,074
What is it?

616
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:05,147
It was a dream.

617
00:55:05,147 --> 00:55:08,784
Ga Eul... I, I had a dream.

618
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:10,520
What dream?

619
00:55:11,453 --> 00:55:15,090
It was a dream, a dream. What a relief.

620
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,170
You and I, we went for a fortune-telling.

621
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,570
There was this lady telling our fortune.

622
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,960
The lady said...

623
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,438
You're going somewhere with me.

624
00:55:29,438 --> 00:55:30,805
Where?

625
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:32,600
You'll know when we get there.

626
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,870
Come on, let's go.

627
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:42,120
- Ga Eul!
- Jan Di!

628
00:55:43,284 --> 00:55:44,960
Jan Di!

629
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,990
Help me out here.

630
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,460
Ga Eul!

631
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,928
Jan Di! Take care!

632
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:55,370
Is she going to war or something?

633
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:59,300
Wow, it's so pretty!

634
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,850
Hey, take a picture of me here!

635
00:56:10,545 --> 00:56:13,340
You do all these tacky things by yourself, don't you?

636
00:56:22,157 --> 00:56:24,059
We're done now, right? Let's go.

637
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,661
Wait a minute!

638
00:56:26,661 --> 00:56:30,532
You saw the scene, and took the photo already, so we're done, right?

639
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:34,140
"Done?" We still have to go up.

640
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,360
Going up there?

641
00:56:39,842 --> 00:56:44,840
Hey! This is my ninth time coming here, and you're the first person to actually go up there.

642
00:56:47,888 --> 00:56:50,740
How did I get stuck with someone like her.

643
00:56:51,987 --> 00:56:56,190
Be patient, the blue and white porcelain...

644
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,208
It's a good thing you came up, right?

645
00:57:47,943 --> 00:57:49,377
You.

646
00:57:49,377 --> 00:57:53,582
This is for lying about Jan Di being in an accident and dragging me here.

647
00:57:53,582 --> 00:57:55,940
Maybe it won't end up being a complete lie.

648
00:57:57,551 --> 00:58:01,423
It feels as though it will only be a matter of time before a real accident happens between those two.

649
00:58:01,423 --> 00:58:03,320
No!

650
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:06,161
What were you imagining?

651
00:58:06,161 --> 00:58:09,210
Who's imagining what?

652
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,280
Stop this and let's go.

653
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:27,730
What?

654
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,410
Why is no one here? Is this a deserted island?

655
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:33,588
You and I, there're two people here.

656
00:58:33,588 --> 00:58:36,225
What's the reason you dragged me to a deserted island?

657
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,000
Reason?

658
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,096
I don't have a reason, but only something on my mind.

659
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:42,330
Goo Joon Pyo!

660
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,570
I'm warning you.

661
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:49,300
You should forget about any ulterior motives you had for bringing me on this trip.

662
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,673
Ulterior motive?
(T/N: literally means "black hearted")

663
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:54,176
Is a human heart a lead from a pencil?
(T/N: "shim" has many meanings, like "heart" and "lead")

664
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:58,890
Should I be more like you, who always takes things the wrong way and is so full of suspicion?

665
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,360
Would that person's heart be more full of light?

666
00:59:02,017 --> 00:59:03,700
Follow me.

667
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,460
♫ Wish Ur My Love, ♫

668
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,580
♫ Come to me now ♫

669
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:20,140
♫ In the excitement that I myself don't know of ♫

670
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:25,430
♫ Today too I, like this I ♫

671
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:30,480
♫ Am pacing in front of you ♫

672
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,670
♫ Does love have to be said to know? ♫

673
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:40,840
♫ I've been wanting it so badly ♫

674
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:45,120
♫ One person with whom I'll promise forever ♫

675
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:47,495
How did you do this?

676
00:59:47,495 --> 00:59:49,790
Didn't I tell you?

677
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:53,960
Every day, you'll be able to enjoy things you can't even imagine.

678
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,806
Jan Di Baht (grass lawn), you act tough, but is it actually really easy to impress you?

679
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:00,430
This was easy?

680
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,915
How did you do this?

681
01:00:07,915 --> 01:00:09,890
Are you like a genie?

682
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,480
Genie?

683
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,690
Who is that jerk? Is he better than me?

684
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,470
No. The genie from Aladdin's lamp.

685
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,690
He can grant any wish.

686
01:00:20,628 --> 01:00:22,997
Ah, and I thought it was someone else.

687
01:00:22,997 --> 01:00:25,901
But, can that genie do anything?

688
01:00:25,901 --> 01:00:27,136
No.

689
01:00:27,136 --> 01:00:30,370
There are some things a genie can't do.

690
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:34,470
Like, killing a person, bringing a person back to life, and...

691
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,110
And?

692
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:41,400
Forcing people to fall in love.

693
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:45,450
It can't do that.

694
01:00:50,392 --> 01:00:54,129
Why are there so many things it can't do?

695
01:00:54,129 --> 01:00:56,880
The more I hear about it, the weaker it sounds!

696
01:00:58,365 --> 01:01:02,504
I can do it all. Whether killing someone or reviving them.

697
01:01:02,504 --> 01:01:06,041
If you put your heart into it, it can be done. So just tell me what you want.

698
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,309
Can you really?

699
01:01:09,911 --> 01:01:11,960
Oh, I almost forgot.

700
01:01:18,354 --> 01:01:21,022
Hello, this is Joon Pyo.

701
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:23,390
This is New Caledonia.

702
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:27,720
Jan Di Bat—, no, I mean, Geum Jan Di is also here with me.

703
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,590
I'll give it to her now.

704
01:01:34,031 --> 01:01:35,750
Mom!

705
01:01:37,337 --> 01:01:38,430
Jan Di.

706
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:41,876
Geum Jan Di, you're doing fine, right?

707
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:43,979
Ah! My daughter! Fighting!

708
01:01:43,979 --> 01:01:46,315
Dad, I'm doing well here!

709
01:01:46,315 --> 01:01:49,885
Noona, noona, is it nice there? Have you eaten the big lobsters?

710
01:01:49,885 --> 01:01:54,523
I'm sorry, San! I'm sorry, I came to such a place alone.

711
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:56,260
No, no! Don't worry about us!

712
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:59,990
- Have fun! Have fun!
- Have a nice time!

713
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,870
Jan Di, be nice to Joon Pyo.

714
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:06,640
This camera phone was sent to us by his secretary.

715
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,330
- Jan Di!
- Wait a minute!

716
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:12,774
Noona, if you give me this phone, I'll forgive you even if you eat ten lobsters alone!

717
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:16,820
Geum Jan Di, the fate of our family is in your hands.

718
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,560
Got it? Aja!

719
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,230
Aja!

720
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:45,450
Did I do something wrong?

721
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,700
- I just...
- No, Goo Joon Pyo.

722
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,410
Thank you.

723
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,650
Then why are you about to cry?

724
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:59,650
It's nice here.

725
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,890
I wish my parents could be here too.

726
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:10,440
My family would really like it here.

727
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:13,270
We'll come together.

728
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:14,902
What?

729
01:03:14,902 --> 01:03:18,820
You and your family can come again together.

730
01:03:23,211 --> 01:03:26,900
If you're done being touched, let's get to the point.

731
01:03:28,148 --> 01:03:29,851
The point?

732
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,610
♫ Shout to the world, "I love you... I love you, ♫

733
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,580
♫ Be my woman" ♫

734
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,320
♫ You are blinding. Always you're my star ♫

735
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,010
♫ I'll protect you ♫

736
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:56,540
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

737
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:00,510
Mom! Dad!

738
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:03,900
Don't go swimming alone again. Don't go on even a walk alone!

739
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,270
You!

740
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,060
You came to give me this?

741
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:10,250
Even if it's cheap, if you lose it, I'll kill you.

742
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:14,460
Did you accept my feelings?

743
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,250
Don't make me wait for too long.

744
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:21,920
Goo Joon Pyo, as of today, I add you to the list of playboys.

745
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,530
You want to eat all of this?

746
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,140
- What did you do to it?
- What?

747
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,710
The thing that I gave you.

748
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:30,610
Ah, that.

749
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:33,170
- What did he do?
- He left at the break of dawn.

750
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:37,470
Geum Jan Di, don't you have any guesses?

751
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:41,900
I know you won't forgive me with just an apology.

752
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,650
It would be good for you to be prepared.

753
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:46,900
♫ Always you're my star ♫

754
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,210
♫ I'll protect you ♫
