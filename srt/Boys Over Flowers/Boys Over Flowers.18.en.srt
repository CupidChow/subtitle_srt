00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,720
Ah, Mom!

165
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,840
Dad!

166
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,100
I'm sorry, Jan Di.

167
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,620
Listen to noona.

168
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,050
Make sure to wash properly and...

169
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,080
Oh, my poor baby.

170
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:43,702
Yes?

171
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,500
- What's going on?
- Um, that is...

172
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,640
Please set it here.

173
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,740
This...

174
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,440
Hey, monkey.

175
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,800
What are you doing at someone else's house?!

176
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,760
Oh, my husband has woken up?

177
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,610
You must be hungry. Let's eat breakfast.

178
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,700
Here, have a seat.

179
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,840
What... is all of this?

180
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,840
What else could it be? Obviously I prepared all of this to be eaten.

181
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,640
There are chefs in my house.

182
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,770
I know, but I wanted to do something for you and this was the only thing I could think of.

183
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,380
You and I are the same, there's never anything we need to buy or that we want right?

184
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,560
So I thought about what if it was me.

185
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,540
I thought, "What is it that I've always longed for?".

186
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,600
So what was it?

187
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,580
Initially, I wanted a happy, fulfilling breakfast table.

188
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,050
I hated eating all by myself at a huge table.

189
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,980
Since you've prepared everything, I'll eat it, but...

190
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,300
Really? Then start by eating this.

191
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,920
This is really good.

192
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,000
And this is good, too.

193
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,380
This one.

194
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,300
Try to eat this.

195
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,300
All right, eat it before this gets cold...

196
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,960
You have to eat this when it's warm.

197
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:48,440
I was so happy when someone took the flesh off the bones and set the fish on my rice for me.

198
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,580
You've never done anything like this, have you?

199
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,380
Is it good?

200
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,280
That's a relief.

201
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,040
Eat this as well.

202
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,520
And meat too.

203
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,400
Do you want to try this?

204
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,360
My ambitious work.

205
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,300
Have some of these vegetables too.

206
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,180
Dessert's after this.

207
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,760
Have you tried some soup?

208
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,140
I made it really yummy.

209
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,540
Did you find anything?

210
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,080
No.

211
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,980
It's not really possible for there to be any.

212
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,830
A place with no deposit and cheap monthly rent,

213
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,560
that's decent for a junior high and a high school student to live in.

214
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,440
It's not likely.

215
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,140
Can't you just come to my house and live with me?

216
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,140
What about Kang San?

217
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,440
Ah yes. You have Geum Kang San.

218
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,260
There's no solution.

219
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,080
I'd better get going.

220
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,460
You're the one who needs help now.

221
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,940
Here's the tea.

222
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,040
How's your shoulder?

223
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,040
It's better now, but now my knee is aching.

224
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,300
I'll get a hotpad for your knee.

225
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,800
Where did such a lovely sweetheart come from?

226
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,220
What is this?

227
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,720
[House | Apartment]

228
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,519
Is cutie looking for a place to stay?

229
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,260
Yes, I'm looking but it's not easy finding a cheap place.

230
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,220
Wait just a moment. I'll get you a hotpad for your knee.

231
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,240
No, no.

232
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,060
When did you get here?

233
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:36,420
Here.

234
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,160
What's this?

235
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,660
- Though it's late, it's our engagement gift.
- Gift?

236
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,509
The one that our parents got is totally not my taste.

237
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:54,920
So, I had these made and I wanted to share them with you.

238
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,800
J J?

239
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,420
Joon Pyo and Jae Kyung.

240
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,780
No, Jae Kyung and Joon Pyo.

241
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,760
Even our initials are fated, don't you think?

242
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,240
Put it on for me.

243
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,200
Where are you going?

244
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,460
There's a place I need to go to.

245
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,580
Where's that?

246
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,880
You're my fiancée, not my wife!

247
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,000
Just go home.

248
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,760
♫ Among the people passing by ♫

249
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,820
♫ I wanted to find you before anyone else ♫

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:28,910

♫ I'm happy because I love you ♫

273
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,420
It's truly fascinating.

274
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,510
How can something like this be made from ordinary dirt?

275
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,470
You're more fascinating.

276
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,450
What kind of girl has no other interests apart from pottery?

277
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,530
Then, what about you?

278
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,640
Is there anything you like more than pottery?

279
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,990
There is.

280
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,860
A girl?

281
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,200
A girl is like a math problem.

282
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,340
In the beginning, I wonder how I'm going to solve it.

283
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,540
I figured out that if I just study it a bit more, then a solution can be found.

284
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,940
It's pretty simple, but there's still a wonder to it.

285
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,360
Why are you looking at me like that?

286
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:11,320
To me, you are like an unsolveable problem.

287
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:13,580
What?

288
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,780
A problem that starts off completely twisted and can't be solved.

289
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,730
Hey, get back here.

290
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,770
Yi Jung!

291
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,820
What on earth happened?

292
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,000
According to Woo Bin, your hand...

293
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,700
It's all over.

294
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,540
For real?

295
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,280
A swimmer who hurts her shoulder and has to stop swimming...

296
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,300
A potter

297
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,020
who ruins his hands and has to give up spinning.

298
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,830
Doesn't it seem like a survival documentary?

299
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,860
What is that supposed to mean?

300
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:26,090
By any chance...

301
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:28,780
are you talking about Geum Jan Di?

302
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,960
Do we know any other swimmers besides Geum Jan Di?

303
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,400
So Yi Jung, Tell me straight.

304
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,740
What do you mean her shoulder's wrecked?

305
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,720
Is this what you were talking about in Macau?

306
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:52,840
If I think about it now,

307
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,960
you really had your wits about you, back in Macau.

308
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:05,560
People like us can't have anything to do with stuff like... innocence and love.

309
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,190
I said to tell it to me straight!

310
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:13,640
Do you remember when Jan Di threw herself in front of that chair so you wouldn't get hurt?

311
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,220
When she found out that she could never swim again,

312
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,940
do you know how much Geum Jan Di cried?

313
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,250
Is that

314
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,140
true?

315
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,680
No matter how much of a tantrum you throw, it's still the same.

316
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,330
People like us,

317
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,280
we do nothing but hurt the women we love.

318
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,360
Here, right here, Kang San.

319
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,480
Is it okay? Just the two of you living here?

320
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,580
It'll be fine. The room has a good view and it's kind of cozy, right Noona?

321
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,540
Thanks, Ga Eul. It's really late.

322
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,760
- I'll go then.
- Thanks.

323
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,170
- See you, San.
- Be careful.

324
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,560
Kang San, are you going to be okay?

325
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,510
Noona, you just don't overdo it yourself.

326
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,780
Let's be careful so we don't make Mom and Dad worry.

327
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,540
- Fighting.
- Fighting.

328
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,890
Okay, Noona, over there.

329
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,320
Let's start cleaning.

330
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,342
You do.

331
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,000
Noona, I'll get that first.

332
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,900
I'm going to hang a framed picture on the wall.

333
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,760
Here?

334
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,440
Whose fault is it that Geum Jan Di can't swim anymore?!

335
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,940
Why aren't you swimming anymore?

336
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,400
I quit.

337
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,140
Why would a swimmer quit swimming?

338
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,380
It's none of your business.

339
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,700
Watch over Joon Pyo while I'm gone.

340
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,820
You know what I mean, don't you?

341
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,060
I understand.

342
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,100
Get a hold of me right away if anything seems remotely strange.

343
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,390
Don't worry. Have a good trip.

344
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,060
Kang San, the house on the left too.

345
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,060
Hey, delivery girl!

346
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,150
One milk for me, too.

347
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,940
Hurry up and throw it. One milk.

348
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,340
Big brother Joon Pyo?

349
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,800
Hey! Goo Joon Pyo!

350
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,680
What are you doing here?

351
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,840
So, is there anything weird about me being at my own house?

352
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,100
Your house?

353
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,980
From today on, I've decided to live here.

354
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,600
Why? Why would you live here?

355
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,920
Shall we say it's some kind of preparation for independence?

356
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,860
Why on earth would you do something like that here?

357
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,400
Don't you watch any dramas?

358
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,680
It's pretty standard procedure to toughen up the princely heir, to train him.

359
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,940
Haven't you heard about deliberately throwing the son off a cliff?

360
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,940
Where was that? Ssss... S...

361
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,364
- Sparta?
- Yes, that's right.

362
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,650
Hey little bro. Don't study all by yourself.

363
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,420
Help your sister study too.

364
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,360
It's hard to communicate when we're on totally different livers.

365
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,020
Different livers?

366
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,320
Different levels.

367
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,050
Whatever training thing you're doing, I wish you well, but could you get out already?

368
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,520
We are a little busy here.

369
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,080
What?

370
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,320
Regardless, we're neighbors now.

371
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:36,880
Let's try to be good neighbors.

372
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,417
If you have any difficulties, I'll help.

373
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,700
Can I reject that request?

374
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,430
What I've just shown you is the wheel procedure

375
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,280
and what you are doing is the coiling procedure.

376
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:32,420
Pay attention to the details, please.

377
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,140
That's it for today.

378
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,360
Thank you.

379
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,320
Confess.

380
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,440
Huh?

381
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,840
Hurry up and confess your feelings to him before it's too late.

382
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,630
The thing is...

383
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,320
I'm a little scared.

384
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,860
He's totally different from me.

385
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:22,060
The thing is, love cannot be achieved by patience.

386
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,000
You can't hide it because you want to.

387
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,580
Anyway, why did you break up with your lover, teacher?

388
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,020
I wanted to stay by his side, the way he wanted me to, but

389
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,310
I wasn't able to do that.

390
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,680
Because I kept wanting more,

391
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,220
and it was too hard.

392
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,760
Did you confess your feelings?

393
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,040
I wonder... did I confess?

394
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:04,960
If you don't want to regret it later, like I do. Then Ga Eul, you should build up your courage and confess your feelings.

395
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,640
What is all this?

396
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,040
Hey! What kind of student comes back so late?

397
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,860
When you're done, you should hurry up and come home.

398
00:43:25,153 --> 00:43:29,080
Hey! By any chance, did you buy all this stuff?

399
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:34,300
Oh, this? I couldn't use it all by myself, so I threw it away here.

400
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,060
Threw away?

401
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,790
But...

402
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,740
what's that smell?

403
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,950
Alright!

404
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,680
It looks yummy.

405
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,580
Kang San, watch out since it's hot.

406
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,280
Why? What?

407
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,380
Yours seems more tasty.

408
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,750
What? Did I cook mine separately?

409
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,260
It's the same as yours.

410
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,040
Give that to me.

411
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,900
Hurry up and hand it over!!

412
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,760
Mmmmm, hey, don't!

413
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,740
That was really delicious!

414
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,060
Little bro isn't there any more?

415
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,230
Because of you, we didn't get more than one mouthful!

416
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,220
All this time, you guys planned to keep this delicious food to yourselves?

417
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,380
That's awfully childish, between neighbors.

418
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,720
Are you done eating?

419
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,840
Then you can leave. Go!

420
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,460
Little bro, don't you have more ramen?

421
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,460
What's up?

422
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,400
I don't like people who come over without a reason.

423
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,400
I do have... a reason.

424
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,380
With me...

425
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,640
Will you go on a date with me?

426
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,040
A date?

427
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,600
Didn't we already do that last time?

428
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,790
Not a fake one. A real date.

429
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,160
Ga Eul, did something shocking happen to you?

430
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,260
Or, did you get dumped by some guy?

431
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,780
I'm not kidding.

432
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,280
I...

433
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,940
I like you, Yi Jung Sunbae.

434
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,260
Thank you.

435
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,600
Thanks, but I have a few rules when it comes to dating.

436
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,560
Rules?

437
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,010
One.

438
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,140
I don't mess with good girls.

439
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,550
Two.

440
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,430
I also don't mess with idiotic girls.

441
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,650
Three.

442
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:16,620
Never mess with girls related to my friends.

443
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,660
Ga Eul, you go against all 3 rules.

444
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,660
You know that, right?

445
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,080
Hence, my answer is, "No."

446
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,100
Sunbae.

447
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,710
You know where the exit is, right?

448
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:05,460
Argh! What the heck is this? Ahhh!

449
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,240
Save me!

450
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,870
Hey! Aishhh, what is that?

451
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,820
AH~~ What's that!

452
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,800
Help me!!

453
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,100
Hey! Don't come!

454
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,510
Hey! Goo Joon Pyo, what's wrong? Are you okay?

455
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,600
Oh gosh.

456
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,140
Hey! That thing...

457
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,540
Is this ok?

458
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,280
I couldn't study because you are so noisy.

459
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,750
Such things are a nuisance in this neighborhood.

460
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,900
If you do this one more time, I'm going to call the police!

461
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,880
- Hey, Geum Jan Di.
- Why! What?!

462
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,020
Wait.

463
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,100
Can you stay for a little while?

464
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:22,450
♫ I keep smelling a familiar fragrance in the air ♫

465
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,640
♫ The breeze that brushed off you ♫

466
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:35,310
♫ Is passing by me now ♫

467
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,310
♫ In my heart ♫

468
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:43,730
♫ Perhaps there's only the sunlight that shines you ♫

469
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:49,030
♫ Even pain and wounds are embraced ♫

470
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:56,740
♫ Love you, I think of you now ♫

471
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,330
♫ I close my eyes again ♫

472
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:04,680
♫ I love you, if I could fill your two eyes ♫

473
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:10,650
♫ I love you, if you show me your smile ♫

474
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,380
♫ Even the starlight there ♫

475
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:20,640
♫ I will bring everything and give it to you ♫

476
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,020
♫ Love you, if I could convey these feelings of mine ♫

477
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:31,370
♫ Love you, if you teach me how that feels ♫

478
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:36,690
♫ I'll follow all of that ♫

479
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,670
♫ Love you Love you Love you ♫

480
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:46,290
♫ My dear ♫

481
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,660
Unnie!

482
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,320
Jan Di!

483
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,580
Why didn't you tell me you moved?

484
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,600
How did you find out?

485
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,820
I went to your house but no one was there, so I asked Ga Eul.

486
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,510
I heard about your parents.

487
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,430
Are you okay?

488
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,000
But what is all this?

489
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,920
Moving presents!

490
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,960
Moving presents?

491
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:32,060
Chen, wait in the car.

492
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,960
Yes, miss.

493
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,840
So this is the neigborhood rooftop house.

494
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,180
It's really romantic.

495
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,740
Ah, sorry. If it hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

496
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,480
I really didn't mean that.

497
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,290
I know.

498
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,580
It's cold. Do you want a cup of tea before you leave?

499
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,560
Is that okay?

500
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,023
Here. Sit here.

501
00:53:04,023 --> 00:53:05,550
Okay.

502
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,880
Are you sure it's ok?

503
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,020
Is this your new way of waking people up?

504
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,650
I didn't know you were interested in art.

505
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,240
Ah, this?

506
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:20,780
I was supposed to go to a showing and write an art report, but it ended.

507
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,920
But it was so expensive, I probably wouldn't have been able to go anyway.

508
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,118
So I thought I'd look at this book and write it.

509
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:29,760
When is it due?

510
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,300
Huh?

511
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,600
When is that report due?

512
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,460
♫ Because I'm stupid ♫

513
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,080
There is no exhibition today.

514
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:14,910
♫ But you are looking at someone else ♫

515
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:20,200
♫ You wouldn't know how I feel ♫

516
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,360
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

517
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,510
♫ I wouldn't even be in your memory ♫

518
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:35,720
♫ I still keep looking at you only ♫

519
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,460
Come in.

520
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:46,170
♫ Your backside ♫

521
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:51,380
♫ Looking at that is also a happiness ♫

522
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:56,620
♫ If you still don't know how I feel ♫

523
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:03,210
♫ If I stop this and go too ♫

524
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:09,440
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

525
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,730
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

526
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:20,070
♫ "I love you" plays on my mouth ♫

527
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:25,260
♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

528
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:30,410
♫ Alone again, missing for you ♫

529
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:36,150
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

530
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,920
Do you want that one?

531
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,500
Uh, no.

532
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,990
This is good enough for me.

533
00:57:50,928 --> 00:57:53,670
Do you know by chance,

534
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:58,920
why the lotus blooms in the mud?

535
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,480
What?

536
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,000
Never mind.

537
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,800
That girl is like the lotus flower, able to clear a muddy water.

538
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,930
Cherish her.

539
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,440
Pardon me?

540
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,630
That girl will make a family for you.

541
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,840
♫ On the days that I think of you too much ♫

542
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:33,030
♫ On the days that my chest hurts and it's sad ♫

543
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:38,280
♫ "I miss you" plays on my mouth ♫

544
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,570
♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

545
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:48,700
♫ Alone again, missing for you ♫

546
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:54,410
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

547
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,151
Now I've become your model as well?

548
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,040
Did you just wake up?

549
00:59:24,244 --> 00:59:29,080
If I'd only known, then I would have made a book.

550
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,510
What kind of book?

551
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,920
An accounting book for all the money I should collect from Geum Jan Di: transportation fee, coffee,

552
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,280
for this exhibiton, and now modeling fees.

553
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,580
If I add it all up, it should be a big lump sum.

554
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,400
Well, here's the modeling fee for a start.

555
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,080
Since it's drawn so well,

556
01:00:05,162 --> 01:00:07,500
I should give you something in return.

557
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,940
Here.

558
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:44,780
The lotus flower clears and refreshes even in the muddiest of waters.

559
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,360
The name is pretty and its function is pretty too.

560
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,400
Just like you.

561
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,040
Huh?

562
01:00:55,609 --> 01:00:56,900
That's it.

563
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,080
The answer to my homework.

564
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,960
Homework?

565
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,750
The more I see you,

566
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,540
the more I'm reminded of the lotus flower.

567
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,880
Lotus flower?

568
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,380
Do you know why the lotus blooms in mud?

569
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,300
Sorry?

570
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,960
That's your homework until next time.

571
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,370
Thanks for the present!

572
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,230
What homework?

573
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,540
What about the witch?

574
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:40,140
She's still in Vancouver.

575
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,320
- Help cover things up for me.
- I understand.

576
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,381
Goo Joon Pyo!

577
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:46,760
Please, you really can't do this.

578
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,160
Goo Joon Pyo!

579
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,860
Hey, you again?

580
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,500
Obviously, the two of us connect.

581
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,660
For some reason, I just felt that if I came by the house, I'd get to see you.

582
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,460
Did you boil your cell phone or put it somewhere?

583
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,320
You're supposed to call and get permission to visit before going to someone's house.

584
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,710
Didn't you learn stuff like that?

585
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,360
Oh, I'm tired!

586
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,080
Now that I think about it, I don't recall ever learning anything like that.

587
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,120
Joon Pyo, do you do that?

588
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,720
Hey, monkey. Aren't you getting up?

589
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,960
Why are you lying down on my bed?

590
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,380
Get up, hurry!

591
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,020
Get up! Hurry!

592
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,750
Get up!

593
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,840
Do you want to make a bet with me?

594
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:56,490
♫ Although I ask it to stop, to stop wherever it is ♫

595
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:00,970
♫ My heart keeps going to you ♫

596
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:05,980
♫ You don't even listen, or give in ♫

597
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:11,120
It's so quiet, it's making me antsy.

598
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,260
I have one question for you. Will you answer?

599
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,320
Love or friendship...

600
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,510
If you had to pick just one, which would you choose?

601
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,100
You put too much pressure on your wrist.

602
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,780
Yi Jung Sunbae!

603
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,570
This...

604
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,610
Isn't it pretty?

605
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,700
It seems like Joon Pyo hyung still likes you, noona!

606
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,790
Is there nothing more you should report to me?

607
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,030
No.

608
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:44,830
Go find out immediately.

609
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,260
This is Geum Jan Di, who will be staying here from today.

610
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,520
Where did you get someone who can't even memorize the menu?

611
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,120
Please look favorably on me.

612
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,300
My private maid?
