You can just let it all out.

330

Un-nie,

331
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,370
I lied.

332
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,920
I'm not fine.

333
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,962
I went because I missed Goo Joon Pyo, but...

334
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:16,217
I can't believe that he could have changed into a totally different person.

335
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,926

00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm truly happy that you've told me this.

340
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,317
Listen to me carefully.

341
00:36:52,317 --> 00:36:57,973
Joon Pyo will definitely come back to you, so don't give up on him just like that.

342
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:02,034
Trust me, and give him one more chance.

343
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:04,350
You can do that, can't you?

344
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,104

[Invitation]

346
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,492
- An invitation to Joon Pyo sunbae's birthday party?
- Yeah.

347
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:14,136
And you want me to take Jan Di there?

348
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,707
Why? Why would I do that?

349
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:24,546
Joon Pyo sunbae, no, that person, you said he dumped Jan Di.

350
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:28,194
Yes, but there's something that's still bothering me.

351
00:38:28,194 --> 00:38:30,581
We'll just say it's to confirm something.

352
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:33,581
But if things go wrong, the one who will be hurt is Jan Di.

353
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,971
Ga Eul, listen carefully.

354
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:40,889
If Joon Pyo dumping Jan Di was an act, then all the better. But

355
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:45,892
even if it was all real, then it's still something Jan Di needs.

356
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:47,691
And it's not just killing her twice?

357
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:53,902
When someone needs to be erased from your memory, then it needs to be done right.

358
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:56,280
Didn't I teach you that before?

359
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,194
What is all this?

360
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,968
If you're going to battle, you need armor, don't you?

361
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,724
Ah, I don't want to.

362
00:39:40,724 --> 00:39:42,384
Why would I go?

363
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:44,353
Are you really never going to see him again?

364
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:46,693
Is it okay to end it like this?

365
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:49,430
He is here in Seoul. And it's his birthday.

366
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,360
You could just congratulate him, couldn't you?

367
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,666
Do you really have nothing you want to say to Joon Pyo sunbae?

368
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,037
The thing that upsets me the most...

369
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:10,637
is not that he acted like he didn't know me, or that he didn't hold onto me til the end.

370
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,850
I couldn't even tell him "thank you".

371
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,980
I couldn't even tell him "I like you.".

372
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,795
I will never get the chance again.

373
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:32,060
Welcome...

374
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,073
Hello Geum Jan Di.

375
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:40,000
Hello.

376
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,940
What brings you here?

377
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,080
Today, there is a birthday party for young master.

378
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,649
By any chance, did Goo Joon Pyo send you here?

379
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:52,322
No.

380
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:04,981
The Chairman wishes for you to attend.

381
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:09,638
The Chairman?

382
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,340
[Happy birthday]

383
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:28,530
It's the F4!

384
00:41:57,645 --> 00:41:59,288
You came.

385
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:04,420
I didn't want to run away, so I did come,

386
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,460
but I can't help thinking it was in vain.

387
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,560
Geum Jand Di, since you're here, you may as well have something to eat before you go.

388
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:19,307
If you just leave alone like a coward, Ga Eul will be feeling awkward throughout the whole night.

389
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:22,376
Geum Jan Di's nothing if not loyal, isn't that right?

390
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,344
Don't you agree, Ga Eul?

391
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:20,286
Today, on behalf of my son, Joon Pyo, and I,

392
00:43:20,286 --> 00:43:23,670
thank you for coming to congratulate Shinhwa.

393
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:28,110
I really thank you for coming.

394
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:35,101
As you all know,

395
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:38,597
our ability to overcome these difficult times

396
00:43:38,597 --> 00:43:43,530
is all thanks to everyone here.

397
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,395
From now until the day that Shinhwa becomes the world's best,

398
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:55,880
I wish that you will still support us.

399
00:43:56,477 --> 00:43:59,758
So I will introduce to you the host for today.

400
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:01,540
Shinhwa Group's future.

401
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,200
Everyone, my son, Goo Joon Pyo.

402
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,310
Happy birthday to you.

403
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:54,720
Happy Birthday to JoonPyo.

404
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,120
Happy birthday to you.

405
00:45:49,612 --> 00:45:51,403
Are you okay?

406
00:45:53,655 --> 00:45:58,230
I think, I should go soon.

407
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,120
I shouldn't have come.

408
00:46:02,858 --> 00:46:05,450
Long time no see, Miss Geum Jan Di.

409
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:09,162
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

410
00:46:09,162 --> 00:46:10,956
Invitation?

411
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:16,938
Since you are here, can I ask you to wish a happy birthday to Joon Pyo?

412
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,351
P-Pardon?

413
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:22,080
Y-yes?
I understand you to be an intelligent young lady who was raised by the efforts of respectable parents whom valued instilling a proper education.

414
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,750
I understand you are an intelligent young lady raised by parents who value proper education.

415
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,603
Would it be rude of me to ask you to play the piano for us tonight?

416
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,093
No way.

417
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:37,816
Does Geum Jan Di know how to play the piano?

418
00:46:37,816 --> 00:46:39,650
She doesn't, right?

419
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,880
I did wonder why she invited her.

420
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,349
She's really something!

421
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,750
My friend and I were just about to...

422
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,490
I'll do it.

423
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:57,170
It's the least I can do to pay for my meal tonight.

424
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,904
I will do it.

425
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,670
Everyone, Geum Jan Di from Shinhwa High School is going to play us a song on the piano.

426
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:33,450

441
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:01,910
As I thought, one should know their place.

442
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:06,010
One should know when to step up, and when to back down.

443
00:51:06,017 --> 00:51:09,144
I'll apologize on her behalf.

444
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,550
Everyone, you've waited a long time for this.

445
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:20,490
Today, we have a very important announcement

446
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:25,579
that I'd like to officially make.

447
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:28,000
Important announcement?

448
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,348
With us today is my son, Goo Joon Pyo's fiancee.

449
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:38,854
She's the girl who is to be the future wife of the Shinhwa Group's head.

450
00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:42,100
What? Fiancee?

451
00:51:43,322 --> 00:51:45,990
What is that grandma trying to do?

452
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,680
Everyone, let me introduce her.

453
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:53,950
She is the daughter of the worldwide JK Group, Ha Jae Kyung.

454
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,830
Hey, let me go!

455
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:59,190
Don't you know I hate this kind of thing?!

456
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,370
Engagement?! What do you mean engagement?

457
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,900
Let go!

458
00:52:02,907 --> 00:52:05,560
I'll go on my own. Let go! Hey!

459
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,080
High heel?

460
00:52:16,352 --> 00:52:17,889
You!

461
00:52:19,391 --> 00:52:21,459
Engagement?

462
00:52:21,459 --> 00:52:25,561
JK Group. This is definitely JoonPyo's mom's doing.

463
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:27,933
That company is that powerful?

464
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:31,778
It's a Korean company, but they are actually an investments firm based in the States.

465
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:37,208
Investments is just a broad term. From oil fields to resorts, they're a global corporation that owns everything.

466
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:41,513
We should have investigated more when we were in Macau.

467
00:52:41,513 --> 00:52:46,550
I thought you guys were thoughtless kids, but I see you've made accurate guesses.

468
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,490
Do you understand now?

469
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,970
That is the standard for the future wife of the Shinhwa Group's head.

470
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:56,940
You need to be of that level to even stand a chance.

471
00:53:01,373 --> 00:53:03,242
What the hell is this?

472
00:53:03,242 --> 00:53:05,765
What's with this sudden engagement thing?

473
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,195
Why the hell did you come here?

474
00:53:10,195 --> 00:53:12,407
Do you think I came because I wanted to?

475
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:14,582
I invited her.

476
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,821
What?

477
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:19,210
Today's event was to introduce your future wife.

478
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:23,170
A friend should at least congratulate you, right?

479
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,654
Are you stupid?

480
00:53:25,654 --> 00:53:28,080
How could you come just because you're invited?

481
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,732
Joon Pyo, let's not do this here.

482
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:33,278
Go somewhere and have a talk between the two of you.

483
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:36,871
I have nothing more to say to Goo Joon Pyo.

484
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:41,085
Now you're starting to understand.

485
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:45,865
What could you say to someone who has a fiancée, right?

486
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:49,682
Excuse me, about the engagement...

487
00:53:49,682 --> 00:53:55,242
All of that seemed like it was some kind of show. Is this for real?

488
00:53:55,242 --> 00:53:57,100
I'm sorry if I surprised you,

489
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,820
but your parents and I already discussed the matter.

490
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,591
This really is the first time I'm hearing about this.

491
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:08,551
Hey "shoe", just keep quiet.

492
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:12,561
And you, you have nothing to say to me?

493
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:16,080
But I do, so don't make a fuss and follow me.

494
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,790
Shouldn't you know better by now?

495
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,443
It's time you realise that if the Evil Witch invites you, there must be some kind of trap.

496
00:54:24,443 --> 00:54:26,821
Hey, wait...

497
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:31,558
You're a year older now, but why isn't there any development?

498
00:54:31,558 --> 00:54:34,941
It wasn't even me, but the old witch who called you. What were you thinking?

499
00:54:34,941 --> 00:54:36,091
Hey, wait.

500
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:40,201
Look! It's obvious she was trying to make a fool out of us both again.

501
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:45,376
How is it that you so easily fall into every trap?

502
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:47,445
Hey, Curly Head!

503
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:48,844
What? Curly head?

504
00:54:48,844 --> 00:54:50,820
Now you're saying whatever you want?

505
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:24,240
Do you now understand that you shouldn't have any more expectations?

506
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,900
Your presence did pay off. What a relief.

507
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,500
I'll take my leave.

508
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,994
Jan Di, what's wrong with her?

509
00:55:39,994 --> 00:55:43,140
Joon Pyo really plans to marry that girl?

510
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:47,960
Ga Eul, I'll take you back home.

511
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,640
Ji Hoo.

512
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:56,380
Let's meet at the hideout. I'll find out more about the situation.

513
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,830
Why are you here?

514
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:18,380
You dragged me here.

515
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,200
That's why I'm asking. Why were you dragged here?

516
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,140
Ever since Macau, I thought you were weird,

517
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,729
but now I know you really are a crazy fool.

518
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:29,320
What? Fool?

519
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,140
If you have eyes, use them.

520
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:35,884
It's the middle of winter, my legs and back are bare, and you dragged me out here.

521
00:56:35,884 --> 00:56:37,869
Shouldn't you apologize first?

522
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:39,805
Who told you to follow me?

523
00:56:39,805 --> 00:56:42,290
Follow? Who's following you?

524
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:46,230
Then fine. From now on, go your own way.

525
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,980
If you follow me again, you're dead.

526
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,090
You, really!

527
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:00,003
What are you doing? Hey!

528
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:03,379
- Hurry and apologize! Now!
- Get off me!

529
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,013
Apologize! Hurry!

530
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:06,490
Aren't you going to apologize?

531
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,570
You crazy monkey-like thing, get off!

532
00:57:15,592 --> 00:57:18,066
What did you just do?

533
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:21,962
Why is your face so red?

534
00:57:21,962 --> 00:57:24,901
What? Is it that you...

535
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,201
S-Shut up and leave!

536
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:30,718
I told you to leave. Why do you keep bothering me?

537
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:33,374
What?

538
00:57:33,374 --> 00:57:36,144
- Give me some money.
- What money?

539
00:57:36,144 --> 00:57:40,315
I have to take a taxi back. Don't you see that you dragged me out here with nothing?!

540
00:57:40,315 --> 00:57:42,240
I don't have any either.

541
00:57:46,321 --> 00:57:49,357
- I said I don't have any money.
- Your cell phone!

542
00:57:49,357 --> 00:57:51,092
Cell phone?

543
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,780
Hey, what are you doing? Where are you touching?

544
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,260
Why are you like this?

545
00:57:59,266 --> 00:58:01,450
Are you a pervert?

546
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,660
What are you guys?

547
00:58:15,483 --> 00:58:17,490
Let go!

548
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,950
Do you know who I am?

549
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:21,920
Miss, are you okay?

550
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:30,520
Ah! I said let go!

551
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:55,030
Are you that shocked?

552
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,470
Excuse me?

553
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,558
Joon Pyo's engagement.

554
00:59:00,558 --> 00:59:02,740
No.

555
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,860
Whether Joon Pyo gets engaged or not, it's not my concern anymore.

556
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,273
You should know that already.

557
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:15,510
Joon Pyo probably didn't know about it either.

558
00:59:16,711 --> 00:59:18,813
About the engagement.

559
00:59:18,813 --> 00:59:24,160
If it was real, he would've told us already.

560
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,030
No.

561
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,580
That person

562
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:33,961
probably knows Goo Joon Pyo.

563
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:36,937
How do you know?

564
00:59:36,937 --> 00:59:41,101
I saw her in Macau.

565
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,370
I'll get going.

566
00:59:59,287 --> 01:00:01,106
Geum Jan Di.

567
01:00:02,257 --> 01:00:04,380
What I told Joon Pyo in Macau...

568
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,260
I know.

569
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:11,820
You said that because you were mad at Joon Pyo.

570
01:00:24,311 --> 01:00:26,113
You're right.

571
01:00:26,113 --> 01:00:30,885
I won't let it bother me. Don't worry about it.

572
01:00:30,885 --> 01:00:32,720
Geum Jan Di,

573
01:00:34,022 --> 01:00:39,250
things you see with your eyes are not always real.

574
01:00:40,395 --> 01:00:42,578
For some things,

575
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,437
you need to have faith to see them.

576
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:59,720
I'll just go. I can go alone.

577
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:04,070
Good night.

578
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,190
Goodbye.

579
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,764
Yoon Ji Hoo, what are you doing?

580
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,140
[Goo Joon Pyo]

581
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,430
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

582
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:54,640
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

583
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,970
♫ "I love you" plays on my mouth ♫

♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

585

♫ Alone again, missing for you ♫

586
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:12,630
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

587
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,400
- Found him.
- What is she doing here?

588
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,440
It's the piece that Queen Elizabeth liked.

589
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,790
Thank you. My pet Leon would love it as a bowl.

590
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:30,330
I've seen a fair share of women, but it's my first time seeing a formidable enemy like her.

591
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:33,900
- We have no choice but to use the emergency method.
- Emergency?

592
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,910
- It's fascinating.
- What is?

593
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:39,090
How you try your best in everything that you do.

594
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,360
Ji Hoo! Ji Hoo!

595
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:48,790
What! You and Lee Jung are doing what?

596
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:49,810
Date.

597
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:52,380
You don't know that Lee Jung's nickname is "5-second killer", do you?

598
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,220
5-second killer? No way!

599
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,200
So what are you planning to do?

600
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,950
Joon Pyo is in the hotel now?

601
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,860
I keep getting greedy. What should I do?

602
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,620
♫ Alone again, missing for you ♫
