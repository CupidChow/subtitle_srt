I hope you didn't forget.

The late president has left it in his will that my right and duty in house is tenured.

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,671
Even you, mistress, cannot undo that promise.

I don't care that you are in this house, but what about that child?

40
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,200
I cannot accept that she set foot in this house even for a moment.

I hired her out of my will,

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,440
so I can fire her when I wish.

46
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:10,838
I think this is no business of yours, mistress.

47
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:15,753
Moreover, she lacks experience as a maid.

That's why it is not time for her to leave.

While I've been away from here,

I was worried about Master Joon Pyo.

62
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,980
He's a child at heart and a sensitive one at that.

I knew that there would be a point when he'd snap.

I think Seo Hyun had told me something similar before.

65

But Master Joon Pyo's different now

66

I have a great debt to this household.

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,510
I believe that the last thing I have to do before I die

69
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,630
is to make sure that Master Joon Pyo will lead his life the right way.

70
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,429
I prided myself on my talent in judging people,

What is this about?

153
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:32,995
After discussing with Jae Kyung's parents, we thought it'd be a good idea to push up the wedding date.

154
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:37,501
You are both adults, and it would be best for both of our businesses

to continue on with the partnership if you two are already married.

00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,492
that you two became a hot topic on the internet and magazines.

170
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:32,274
The marketing team decided that you two

171
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:38,792
would be the best choice to advertise the phone.

172
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,478
Jae Kyung, I'm sorry to have to make you work, but you could help us out, right?

173
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:46,655
Of course. It's my honor.

174
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:49,294
I... I can't accept this!

175
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:51,400
Joon Pyo...

176
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,894
Give and take.

177
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:57,300
You haven't forgotten the basics of business, right?

178
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,160
[You've received a message]

179
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,880
Can you come to my room for a bit?
[Jaekyung]

180
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,304
How do I look?

181
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,367
Pretty.

182
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,360
It's really pretty.

183
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,040
Joon Pyo's mother gave me this.

184
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,127
It's over 20 years old, but I think it'll still work.

185
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:46,020
I might just wear this.

186
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,220
Wait, look at this too.

187
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,624
She says she won't give me the pearls yet.

188
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:02,940
She told me she'd give them to me when we have our first kid.

189
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,131
Don't you think she's getting a little ahead of herself?

190
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:07,503
But it's pretty funny to think about.

191
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:10,768
A kid that looks like Goo Joon Pyo and Ha Jae Kyung.

192
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:18,766
Jan Di, I have a request.

193
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,920
What is it?

194
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,537
First, you have to promise me that you'll do it.

195
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,449
Be my maid of honor.

196
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,035
What?

197
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:35,846
It can't be anyone else.

198
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:38,571
It has to be Jan Di.

199
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,962
You'll do it, right? Hmm?

200
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,540
Action, take one.

201
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:07,690

♫ Just don't know me at all ♫

206

207
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,660
♫ I still think of you ♫

208
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:20,950
You can't use those in the winter.

209
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,130
Use worms.

210
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:43,940
It's served me well over the years.Take it.

211
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,659
Do you want to come?

212
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:01,415
I'll leave in ten minutes.

213
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,800
Ji Hoo...

214
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,880
Wait... That's right.

215
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:31,583
Your mom made one mean spicy fish stew.

216
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:45,532
Today is their wedding anniversary.

217
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,690
I still remember very clearly

218
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,992
giving that to your grandmother and putting it on.

219
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:14,293
Her smile was so bright.

220
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:21,263
I asked what was so great about receiving that old cheap ring.

221
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:28,421
She said, "It's the only one in the world. Why wouldn't I be happy?"

222
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:35,277
Child...

223
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:40,201
I'm sorry.

224
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:45,605
I took away that kind of a mother from you.

225
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:50,470
All because of my karma.

226
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,900
For you, the chosen one. Shinhwa Call.

227
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:18,436
What are you planning on doing?

228
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,357
I don't know either.

229
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:25,833
It feels like a bomb went off in my head and everything is scrambled.

230
00:24:27,483 --> 00:24:29,237
What should I do?

231
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,263
What is it that I can do?

232
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:33,809
You have to find a way.

233
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:38,290
Only you can find a solution.

234
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,531
If this was like the past,

235
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:47,310
the solution of course would be to marry her.

236
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:52,510
How is it that we have become ones who question, and worry about, our definite solution?

237
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:13,058
It looks like we're going to end up being groomsmen.

238
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:36,810
Are you okay?

239
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,290
About what?

240
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,148
You know what.

241
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:43,713
Jan Di, this time it's a real marriage.

242
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:49,912
You know that marriage is different from dating for a few days and breaking up.

243
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,940
For you, the chosen.

244
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,175
Shinhwa Call

245
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:09,051
That's the future of those two people.

246
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,083
And that's the place Joon Pyo's supposed to fill.

247
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,052
Hi, mom and dad. You guys are doing well, right?

248
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:26,802
San too?

249
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:29,350
What?!

250
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,650
You should be eating well! What are you going to do getting sick?!

251
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,400
Hey.

252
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,610
Yes.

253
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,023
Don't worry about me.

254
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:49,550
Please take care of your health.

255
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,495
Don't be so frugal and cheap either.

256
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:56,290
Buy and eat some meat, too.

257
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,010
Understand?

258
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,130
Okay.

259
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,230
Yes, grandfather?

260
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,470

261
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:46,670

269
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,290
The Couple Wedding Contest.

270
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,780
They said they would give you a prize if you win.

271
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,481
You can also wear a wedding dress for free.

272
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:28,083
Prize?

Don't try saving money.

00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:48,630
♫ One person with whom I'll promise forever ♫

333
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,360
♫ That's you, dear ♫

334
00:36:02,022 --> 00:36:04,184
Are you okay?

335
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:08,259
the day has finally come

336
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:10,629
Jan Di came with us.

337
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:13,450
Does any of this make sense?

338
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:18,007
Whether the monkey asked her to be the maid of honor...

339
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:20,605
or the girl that accepted it.

340
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:26,244
Who do you think is having the hardest time right now?

341
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,039
Jan Di,

342
00:36:59,212 --> 00:37:01,180
you came.

343
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,470
You really came.

344
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,108
Thank you.

345
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:23,420
I know that

346
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:29,850
you and Joon Pyo really like each other.

347
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:36,147
Jae Kyung.

348
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:38,070
Wait no...

349
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,260
Even right now...

350
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,650
I don't know if you still like each other...

351
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:54,743
I'm sorry I pretended to not know.

352
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:59,404
I'm not usually like this.

353
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:04,609
I was a little disloyal and cowardly towards you.

354
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:06,777
No.

355
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:11,380
It was because I didn't come out honestly and tell you.

356
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:14,719
You're right.

357
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,891
It wasn't that you didn't want to, it was because you couldn't.

358
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:20,780
And,

359
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:25,063
even if you had told me,

360
00:38:25,063 --> 00:38:27,899
I'm sure nothing would have changed.

361
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:30,640
I...

362
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,970
wouldn't have given up on Joon Pyo.

363
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:49,854
I...
really do like you a lot.

364
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:57,361
If someone told me to pick the two most precious people in the world to me,

365
00:38:58,273 --> 00:39:01,478
I would say Goo Joon Pyo and Geum Jan Di.

366
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:03,634
Jae Kyung...

367
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,540
Therefore,

368
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,340
I'm really sorry.

369
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:13,040
Because I made your heart ache,

370
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,550
I'll make it up to you somehow.

371
00:39:16,552 --> 00:39:18,851
Please forgive me.

372
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,510
♫ Although I ask it to stop, to stop wherever it is ♫

373
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,950
♫ My heart keeps going to you ♫

374
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,490
♫ You don't even listen, or give in ♫

375
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,850
♫ Why is my love like this? ♫

376
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:25,370
♫ Counting each memory one by one ♫

377
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,880
♫ My heart can't rest for even a moment ♫

378
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,350
♫ It will only become a burden that's too much to handle ♫

379
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,760
♫ Why can't I just throw it away? ♫

380
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,390
♫ Something must have happened to my heart ♫

381
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,700
♫ I must have become a fool blinded by love ♫

382
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,900
♫ Just this one thing, just your feelings ♫

383
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,580
♫ Can't you share it with me? ♫

384
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,974
Hey, Joon Pyo!

385
00:41:00,974 --> 00:41:02,952
Stop playing and come here.

386
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:04,756
You're going to faint that way.

387
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,959
He actually might be trying to faint.

388
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,527
Are we really supposed to let him do that?

389
00:41:26,512 --> 00:41:30,448
How did you end up breaking up with him?

390
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,317
Who knows...

391
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:35,019
How did we break up?

392
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:39,424
You asked if I confessed, right?

393
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:43,961
I did confess.

394
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:49,633
Just once. I gathered up all my courage for 10 years worth of feelings

395
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:53,037
that I had been carrying around.

396
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:55,434
It was on Valentine's day.

397
00:41:57,168 --> 00:42:01,880
Believing that if we were destined, that how I truly felt would be understood,

398
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,850
I put everything on the line.

399
00:42:07,886 --> 00:42:11,322
So how did it turn out?

400
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:15,426
I wasn't able to get it through to that person.

401
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:17,530
My feelings, that is.

402
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,865
The amazing thing is,

403
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:25,069
after I did that, my heart was completely emptied.

404
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:28,006
Just like how the low tide drifts away.

405
00:42:29,074 --> 00:42:32,843
I thought... alright, it's up to this point.

406
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:38,583
As I felt us being combed through, it was almost to the point where I felt like I could almost touch that feeling.

407
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:43,955
It felt like solving a math problem that I had been working on for a very long time.

408
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:45,557
I felt it was for the better.

409
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:47,207
And it didn't hurt afterwards?

410
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:49,994
I've done everything I could, without any regrets,

411
00:42:49,994 --> 00:42:52,430
so it didn't really hurt.

412
00:42:54,266 --> 00:43:00,004
So Ga Eul, keep trying until you have no regrets.

413
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:07,311
Isn't the situation too serious for you to be playing in the flower field?

414
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:20,910
At this age, a marriage of convenience

415
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,113
doesn't seem real.

416
00:43:23,113 --> 00:43:27,750
In our world, it's not something to be surprised by.

417
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,301
Sunbae too... Do you accept this kind of future as well?

418
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:34,471
Who knows.

419
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:37,005
Whether it's this kind of future or that kind of future.

420
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:40,010
Neither one looks too different from the other.

421
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:43,984
How can you be so irresponsible about your one and only life?

422
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:48,450
Because you're like this, no one can stay by your side.

423
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:56,991
Now that you know about my family and my weaknesses, is that why you're acting as if you knew everything?

424
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:03,000
Why on earth didn't you go see her

425
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:11,708
on Valentine's day 3 years ago?

426
00:44:45,577 --> 00:44:49,714
It's getting cold. We should go inside.

427
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:12,656
Today might be your last chance.

428
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:15,363
Joon Pyo.

429
00:45:17,275 --> 00:45:20,734
If you want to hang onto him, there's no time.

430
00:45:26,718 --> 00:45:32,822
Ever since I got to know you, I hoped for only one thing.

431
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:36,563
That you'll become happy

432
00:45:36,563 --> 00:45:38,983
and you won't cry anymore.

433
00:45:39,664 --> 00:45:42,900
Like the first time we met,

434
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,335
smiling brightly.

435
00:45:46,938 --> 00:45:51,842
When tomorrow passes, you might not smile anymore.

436
00:45:51,842 --> 00:45:53,644
That scares me.

437
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,282
Please don't worry.

438
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:02,293
I can smile.

439
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:04,479
I will smile.

440
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:09,863
Because sunbae

441
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,299
is watching over me.

442
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:25,515
I think I got hit by the wind a lot,

443
00:46:25,515 --> 00:46:27,612
my eyes are salty.

444
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,292
I'm okay.

445
00:46:46,764 --> 00:46:50,601
My tears are so used to be wiped away by you, Sunbae.

446
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:54,671
That's why they keep stupidly falling like this.

447
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:56,799
Whoa, you surprised me! What are you doing?!

448
00:47:56,799 --> 00:47:58,536
Who says I'm doing something?

449
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:00,671
This girl really...

450
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:04,874
There's no use glaring at me like that because starting from tomorrow, you're mine.

451
00:48:04,874 --> 00:48:06,544
Yours?! Who's yours?

452
00:48:06,544 --> 00:48:08,513
Stop whining and come downstairs.

453
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,698
The adults are waiting.

454
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,980
Alright.

455
00:48:34,406 --> 00:48:36,674
Starting tomorrow, we're really going to be one family.

456
00:48:36,674 --> 00:48:38,776
I guess so.

457
00:48:39,577 --> 00:48:41,183
Shinhwa and JK.

458
00:48:41,183 --> 00:48:45,516
And for our children's happiness, let's make a toast.

459
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,852
What are you doing hiding in here?

460
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,989
Noona, when did you come?

461
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:04,811
There's no need to tell anyone since I'm not here for your wedding.

462
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:07,010
I know.

463
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,566
Aren't I pathetic?

464
00:50:08,566 --> 00:50:14,534
Goo Joon Pyo. I'm asking how far you're willing to take this?

465
00:50:14,534 --> 00:50:16,173
How far does that need to be?

466
00:50:16,173 --> 00:50:17,975
Everything.

467
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:21,188
Family, Shinhwa Group.

468
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:25,716
And even Goo Joon Pyo, your name.

469
00:50:32,355 --> 00:50:35,072
I wasn't able to.

470
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:39,861
When I threw everything away, what would Goo Joon Hee become?

471
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:43,337
To live my life as a nobody, and only being known as one man's woman.

472
00:50:43,337 --> 00:50:45,369
I didn't have the courage to do that.

473
00:50:46,204 --> 00:50:47,772
Noona.

474
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:51,608
From that one incident that I was a coward for,

475
00:50:51,608 --> 00:50:54,311
it played its toll on me and made things hard.

476
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:59,150
I thought I could forget it,

477
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,922
but I couldn't.

478
00:51:01,922 --> 00:51:06,450
Are you still apologetic to that person?

479
00:51:07,725 --> 00:51:09,510
No,

480
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:14,690
it's not him I feel sorry towards.

481
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:19,136
It's to whom I thought would always be genuine and justified.

482
00:51:19,136 --> 00:51:22,145
20-year-old Goo Joon Hee.

483
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:36,452
Little brother, no matter what you decide to do,

484
00:51:36,452 --> 00:51:39,356
I'm going to understand.

485
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:42,459
And no matter what you do, or where you do it,

486
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:46,646
you'll always be my little brother, Goo Joon Pyo, that I love.

487
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:48,931
That will never change.

488
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,898
- Ji Hoo.
- Just say it.

489
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:45,189
To me, you're my brother,

490
00:52:46,983 --> 00:52:51,466
in the past and even in the future.

491
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:56,534
But sometimes I think

492
00:52:59,036 --> 00:53:01,905
you would probably live well without me.

493
00:53:02,906 --> 00:53:05,575
But what will I do without you?

494
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:07,744
Could you be

495
00:53:07,744 --> 00:53:11,394
asking me to help you run away tomorrow?!

496
00:53:12,046 --> 00:53:14,581
Are you?

497
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:23,502
Hit me just once.

498
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:24,643
What?

499
00:53:24,643 --> 00:53:26,536
This isn't a joke.

500
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:28,784
I have to take a hit from you.

501
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:30,585
Joon Pyo...

502
00:53:50,217 --> 00:53:54,830
Jan Di... I can't let her go.

503
00:53:58,759 --> 00:54:00,631
Which one do you think is better?

504
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:03,613
This one or this one?

505
00:54:04,637 --> 00:54:06,534
They're all pretty.

506
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,736
You can't say that.

507
00:54:08,736 --> 00:54:12,607
You have to tell the bride 100% coldly and truthfully, as the best friend of the bride.

508
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:16,147
If you say you like them all, it doesn't help.

509
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:19,079
Sorry,

510
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:23,697
but all of them really are pretty.

511
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,430
[You've received a message]

512
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,465
I have something to say.

513
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,405
Do you, bride, Ha Jae Kyung, take groom, Goo Joon Pyo,

514
00:55:52,405 --> 00:55:56,315
as your husband, in times of happiness and sadness,

515
00:55:56,315 --> 00:56:00,413
as long as you both shall live?

516
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:02,682
Yes.

517
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,956
Do you, groom, Goo Joon Pyo, take bride, Ha Jae Kyung, as your wife,

518
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:11,793
in sickness and in health,

519
00:56:11,793 --> 00:56:15,979
and love each other as long as you both shall live?

520
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:21,626
I can't.

521
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:26,312
I can't do it.

522
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,181
Goo Joon Pyo.

523
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:36,717
This is just for fun.

524
00:56:36,717 --> 00:56:38,452
Why are you so serious?

525
00:56:38,452 --> 00:56:41,075
I'm not joking, Monkey.

526
00:56:41,075 --> 00:56:42,824
No.

527
00:56:46,684 --> 00:56:48,403
Ha Jae Kyung.

528
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:53,432
We can't get married.

529
00:56:53,432 --> 00:56:55,559
Joon.

530
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:57,237
I'm sorry.

531
00:56:58,673 --> 00:57:00,607
If sorry were enough,

532
00:57:00,607 --> 00:57:05,845
then why are there laws and why are there police?

533
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:11,751
There's a girl I love.

534
00:57:12,986 --> 00:57:15,455
The first since I was born.

535
00:57:15,455 --> 00:57:17,957
And until the day I die,

536
00:57:17,957 --> 00:57:20,760
she's the only one.

537
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,532
Do you still want to marry me?

538
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,130
Yes.

539
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:30,270
Are you out of your mind?

540
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:36,143
I know. That girl is Geum Jan Di.

541
00:57:37,277 --> 00:57:39,245
But,

542
00:57:40,481 --> 00:57:44,185
I want you and I want to continue.

543
00:57:46,587 --> 00:57:48,760
It might be funny,

544
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,250
but I like you because you're single-minded.

545
00:57:54,563 --> 00:57:57,001
Because you're a man who knows how to love properly,

546
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:59,165
I like you more.

547
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:02,403
The fact that it's Geum Jan Di,

548
00:58:03,237 --> 00:58:05,373
I can endure it.

549
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:09,147
I know you won't forget her easily.

550
00:58:09,147 --> 00:58:11,111
But,

551
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:13,279
I will wait.

552
00:58:14,081 --> 00:58:16,278
If I wait and see,

553
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,486
next time, there might be a chance for me.

554
00:58:20,486 --> 00:58:22,592
That you will love me like you love her.

555
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:24,491
Ha Jae Kyung.

556
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:28,108
That's all I need.

557
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:31,231
It's worth the investment for me.

558
00:58:49,411 --> 00:58:51,317
Goo Joon Pyo.

559
00:58:52,107 --> 00:58:53,954
Forgive me.

560
00:58:54,923 --> 00:58:56,823
I don't want to.

561
00:58:58,593 --> 00:59:00,594
Listen well.

562
00:59:01,562 --> 00:59:05,131
We are going to be husband and wife in this place tomorrow.

563
00:59:05,131 --> 00:59:07,933
No matter what,

564
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:10,104
until the day we die

565
00:59:10,104 --> 00:59:13,286
we're going to promise to love each other.

566
00:59:14,274 --> 00:59:17,953
Even though you are pleading with me to forgive you,

567
00:59:19,614 --> 00:59:23,316
there's nothing for me to forgive.

568
00:59:29,918 --> 00:59:32,907
It's late already.

569
00:59:32,907 --> 00:59:37,597
They begged me to go to bed early tonight for my make-up tomorrow.

570
00:59:37,597 --> 00:59:40,113
I'll be going first.

571
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:02,090
♫ Although I ask it to stop, to stop wherever it is ♫

572
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:06,530
♫ My heart keeps going to you ♫

573
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:11,040
♫ You don't even listen, or give in ♫

574
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,460
♫ Why is my love like this? ♫

575
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:19,990
♫ Something must have happened to my heart ♫

576
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,440
♫ I must have become a fool blinded by love ♫

577
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,460
♫ Just one place, everyday one place ♫

578
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:33,930
♫ Can't you share it with me? ♫

579
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:41,060
♫ Can't you love me? ♫

580
01:00:48,842 --> 01:00:51,972
Joon Pyo, it's almost time.

581
01:00:51,972 --> 01:00:54,301
You'd better come out.

582
01:01:03,815 --> 01:01:05,485
Woo Bin.

583
01:01:06,053 --> 01:01:07,433
I have a favor to ask.

584
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:09,255
What's it?

585
01:01:09,255 --> 01:01:10,947
Please break my arm!

586
01:01:10,947 --> 01:01:12,326
What?!

587
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:14,295
Joon Pyo.

588
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,062
There's no time

589
01:01:17,831 --> 01:01:19,867
With your skill, you can do it in one blow.

590
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:21,704
Are you serious?

591
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:40,650
What are you doing right now?

592
01:01:47,527 --> 01:01:49,329
Don't worry about it. Go outside.

593
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:52,765
Is that all you could come up with?

594
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:57,539
If that is the only way to stop the wedding, then it's better if you just go ahead with it.

595
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:58,806
Geum Jan Di...

596
01:01:58,806 --> 01:02:00,707
You're a coward!

597
01:02:00,707 --> 01:02:03,143
You're not being dignified in front of anyone.

598
01:02:03,143 --> 01:02:06,453
You're not facing it, you're just running away!

599
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:10,249
If you run away like this...

600
01:02:10,249 --> 01:02:12,886
someday, it might happen again.

601
01:02:15,956 --> 01:02:18,591
Then tell me not to do it!

602
01:02:18,591 --> 01:02:21,227
Tell me not to go!

603
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:43,140
♫ Although I ask it to stop, to stop wherever it is ♫

604
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:47,620
♫ My heart keeps going to you ♫

605
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:52,070
♫ You don't even listen, or give in ♫

606
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:56,450
♫ Why is my love like this? ♫

607
01:02:56,450 --> 01:03:01,070
♫ Counting each memory one by one ♫

608
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:05,650
♫ My heart can't rest for even a moment ♫

609
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,150
Cut!

610
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,640
Should I cut this?

611
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,844
Say something!

612
01:03:17,223 --> 01:03:21,030
- We have to shoot it again.
- Do I have to go up there?

613
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,140
Wait a minute.

614
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:29,460
Wait a minute!

615
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,130
It's slippery.

616
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,370
You won't film my legs, right?

617
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:38,570
Did you take that?

618
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:41,680
Okay.

619
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,920
Okay.

620
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,749
Did I fall asleep? Did you shoot that?
