In the midst of a global financial crisis, Shinhwa Group has been selected

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,349
as one of the biggest sponsors for the 2012 London Olympics.

8
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:32,506
Since the start of Korea's economic development, a single company has been holding the highest ranking.

Continuing with its ever-continuous growth,

10
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:39,169
one entity has finally been established in the international market as a world-class company.

11
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:42,560
And that company is Shinhwa.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,940
From electronics, oil refineries, and automobiles, to delivery and telecommunications,

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,195
even if you're a someone who doesn't know the President's name,

00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:53,516
you would have definitely come across the name "Shinhwa."

It is a massive empire and a model Korean conglomerate.

17
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:08,190
and its founder was invited to the Blue House,
(T/N: official residence of the president of South Korea)

18

he refused to accept a medal of honor and instead he said,

Incorporated Association, Shinhwa Academy.

21
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:26,622
The school is the first of its kind to be seen in the history of Korean education.

22
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:31,220
This was during a time when economic development was more important than equal opportunities in education.

23
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,372
The President spared no expense and even passed special laws to make the school a reality.

24
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:39,836
Now, there's even a saying that no family can get anywhere without a Shinhwa degree.

25
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:43,340
Shinhwa was based on, and built by, the top 1% of Korean society,

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,980
for the top 1% of society.

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,390
Also, enrollment is so competitive that even most upper-class children aren't accepted, even if they apply for registration the moment after their birth.

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,980
However, once enrolled, students can attend Shinhwa

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,780
from elementary, middle, and high school, until university.

Shinhwa is both, the object of their hatred and envy.

However, in this school for the chosen sons and daughters of God,

[Jan Di Dry Cleaners]

163
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,354
I'm home—

164
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:50,170
She's here!

165
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,224
Jan Di!

Say hello to him.

167
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,164
He came from the Shinhwa Chairwoman's office.

168
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:02,020
So I finally meet the famous Wonder Girl.

169
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,930
It's nice to meet you.

170
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,834
I didn't push him.

171
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:10,544
Really, I didn't. That "F4" or something... they did.

172
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:11,544
That's not why I'm here.

173
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:16,323
Jan Di, my daughter, just calm down and listen.

174
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:21,120
Starting tomorrow, you will attend Shinhwa High School.

You're in!

What the heck are you?

00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:27,394
To tell the truth...

178
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:32,599
The Chairwoman has come to admire you, and she decided to accept you as a special scholarship student!

179
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,267
She decided to accept you!

180

Scholarship student? Why me?

We would like you, Geum Jan Di...

182

Noona, you know how you used to swim, back in middle school?

I like the way things are now.

I wouldn't fit into the school and I don't want to go to that school either.

You should probably go.

Jan Di, why don't you think about it a little—

192

There's no need to think about anything. She will be there tomorrow.

Shut up!

Then, I'll see you at school tomorrow.

Yes, even if I have to drag her by the neck, I will make sure she's at school tomorrow.

Isn't it you who's always saying that those people only know how to brag about their wealth?

wasn't it regarding our F4, was it... transfer student?

I hear your family owns a laundromat.

283

It's not a laundromat. It's a dry cleaner.

I'll let you off this time.

290

What?

291
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:53,954
For the things you said about the F4!

293
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,425
Are they that remarkable?

294
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:01,210
Hey, transfer student,

295
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,730
you really don't know a thing about the F4, do you?

296
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,602
No, I don't.

297
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:18,779
Girls, let's go.

298
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:38,565
Song Woo Bin, the son of Il-Sim Construction, also known as the blue-chip stock of the construction industry.

299
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:42,869
They are real estate tycoons. People say half of Jeju Island belongs to Il-Sim.

300
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:47,808
They're the head family of Il-Sim Pa, an organization with 50 years of history.

301
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:51,111
They still have quite a few high-class clubs and saloons.

302
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:56,082
When it comes to cash mobilization, they are valued as King Wang Jjang.
(T/N: the best of the best)

303
00:27:57,651 --> 00:28:03,957
So Yi Jung is a genius ceramic artist who debuted at the Biennale at the age of 16 as the youngest artist.

304
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:08,061
He is one of the young artists to be selected by UNESCO.

305
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:13,600
There is at least one who made it on his own.

306
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,303
Cast away the prejudice that genius would be poor.

307
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:19,460
You know the cultural assets' independence fighter, So Yoon He, in Korean History textbooks?

308
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,943
He is the owner of Woo Song Museum and the grandfather of F4 So Yi Jung.

309
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:25,712
Woo Song Museum?

310
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:29,215
Do you mean it's his family's? How rich are they?

311
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:32,252
Don't try to imagine. You'll hurt yourself.

312
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:42,195
That's a picture of the old president (of Korea).

313
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:45,599
Look at this kid sitting next to him.

314
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,335
He is F4's very own Yoon Ji Hoo.

315

[The son and daughter-in-law of President Yoon Seok Young died in a mysterious car accident. The only survivor was his five-year-old grandson.]

316
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:58,479
You mean Yoon Ji Hoo is the grandson of President Yoon Seok Young?

317
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:01,381
You know Soo Am Art Center where Jang Young Joo played?

318
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:07,320
He owns the Soo Am Art Foundation, a soccer team in Europe and a Major League baseball team.

319
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,590
I envy him the most in the world.

320
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:14,628
You don't really need me to explain who this is, right?

321
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:19,420
The successor of the great Shinhwa group. Even a three-year-old knows who he is.

322
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,220
This man is the F4 leader, Goo Joon Pyo.

323
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,380
♫ It's a yearning heart, it's a yearning heart ♫

324
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,850
♫ Even at your side, I'm always longing for you ♫

325
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:36,060
♫ Hey, my girl, like glass, it's an anxious heart to me ♫

326
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,220
♫ It's a yearning heart, it's a yearning heart ♫

327
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,550
♫ Even at your side, I'm always longing for you ♫

328
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:48,960
♫ Hey, my girl, like this, I want to hold you in my arms ♫

329
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,630
♫ Your smile is like the sunshine ♫

330
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,710
♫ Your fragrance is like the wind, your warm breath ♫

331
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,600
♫ Hey, my girl, like this, I want to hold you in my arms ♫

332
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,770
♫ It's a yearning heart, it's a yearning heart ♫

333
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,230
♫ Even at your side, I'm always longing for you ♫

334
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:14,440
♫ Hey, my girl, like glass, it's a yearning heart to me ♫

335
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,660
♫ It's a yearning heart, it's a yearning heart ♫

336
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,000
♫ Even at your side, I'm always longing for you ♫

337
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,208
♫ Hey, my girl, like this, I want to hold you in my arms ♫

338
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,850
F4 are those kind of guys?

339
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,210
No way!

340
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:36,352
Goo Jung Pyo, you are Goo Jung Mool (sewage)!

341
00:30:36,352 --> 00:30:40,623
F4, you flies!

342
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:45,494
If you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you should be thankful and be nice to people!

343
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:49,250
It's annoying that someone like you is

344
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,830
the successor of Shinhwa Group!

345
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:58,573
You better hope the two of us never come face to face.

346
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:01,320
The day I have to call you "Sunbae",

347
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,880
will be the day I'll dive from the rooftop!

348
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:25,768
Yoon Ji Hoo!

349
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:31,040
Someone else is being very annoying too.

350
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:35,677
It's so loud, I can't even sleep.

351
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:39,748
I'm so sorry. I thought no one was here.

352
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:42,784
Is that really true?

353
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,253
What?

354
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,656
That you will dive?

355
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:53,330
So, the thing is...

356
00:31:54,763 --> 00:31:57,066
So you heard everything?

357
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:58,667
About what?

358
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:01,237
I mean...

359
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:05,507
Goo Jung Mool (sewage)? Or flies?

360
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,370
Oh right,

361
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,240
Joon Pyo...

362
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:20,623
Huh?

363
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:24,460
It's "Goo Joon Pyo," not "Goo Jung Pyo".

364
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,965
Remembering the right name is the least you can do when you hate someone, right?

365
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,752
Rice balls!

366
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:52,287
You like them? What the heck are rice balls?

367
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:55,523
It looks so pretty and delicious!

368
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,371
What's that smell?

369
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,639
It completely stinks!

370
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:16,178
Oh, here it is.

371
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:19,030
Oh my God!

372
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,340
Terrible!

373
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,670
Hey, transfer student, why are you eating such low grade food

374
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,850
when there's an expensive spread over there?

375
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,725
What?

376
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:31,360
Then?

377
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:39,101
Over $50 for one meal is a nuisance in my home.

378
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:45,174
So, you're planning to keep eating these stinky lunch boxes?

379
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:46,942
Yes I am.

380
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,810
God!

381
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,161
Good!

382
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:09,397
It's F4!

383
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:13,200
Mi Sook, come on!

384
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,939
I'm going crazy!

385
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:27,710
Can I...

386
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,320
try that?

387
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,060
Welcome!

388
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,297
Thank you!

389
00:34:50,806 --> 00:34:52,074
Is she from Germany?

390
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:55,130
Yeah, she looks really pretty.

391
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,945
I thought she was a doll or something.

392
00:34:56,945 --> 00:35:00,382
Anyway, it's great that you made a friend already.

393
00:35:00,382 --> 00:35:04,319
I was worried you might be a loner.

394
00:35:06,922 --> 00:35:08,490
I am a loner.

395
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,491
What?

396
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:11,826
I'm an outcast.

397
00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:16,698
But I'm thankful that I don't get noticed.

398
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:21,803
I'll stay a loner until the day I graduate.

399
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:24,506
Who are you?

400
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,942
What happened to our Jan Di?

401
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:32,047
The one who protected me from that wicked kindergarten owner's son.

402
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,810
The one who fought against the gangs in junior high.

403
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,085
All of that was the work of the justice girl, Geum Jan Di.

404
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:38,787
So, what's wrong?

405
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:41,022
What can I do?

406
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:46,627
I'd probably get beaten up to death by my mother before I cause trouble and get expelled from school.

407
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:49,962
You!

408
00:35:49,962 --> 00:35:54,102
Do you think... do you think I'm wasting cucumbers?

409
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:59,141
Your father wanted to eat cucumber kimchi, but I'm investing it in your face.

410
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:01,910
What kind of investment are you doing with cucumbers?

411
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,080
Won't this treatment give you beautiful skin?

412
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,752
Even the worst boy in your school is the super A plus when it comes to marriage material.

413
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:14,556
It seems like we've hit the jackpot. Don't you think so, honey?

414
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:18,760
Don't disturb me. I'm artistically sharpening the edge.

415
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,729
Mom, stop this!

416
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:24,266
Look at you, look at you!

417
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,902
Don't be so ungrateful!

418
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:31,005
And why are you ironing that?

419
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:34,342
Your arms will hurt from ironing all day long.

420
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:40,281
I'm 15 years in the dry cleaning business, and never once before have I seen such fine clothing.

421
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:45,020
Ordinary people would be lucky to wear such cloth even on their wedding day.

422
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,221
Oh, boy!

423
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:50,758
Noona, let me borrow it to wear on Sunday.

424
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:56,965
Jan Di, when it comes to clothes like this, you must treat them as kindly as your boss.

425
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,234
Be careful when you sit and stand up.

426
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:03,504
Take good care of it and avoid any stains. Understand?

427
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm ironing this beautiful thing for my daughter. There's no way my arms would hurt from that.

428
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,740
No, dad is totally fine.

429
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,916
Oh my!

430
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:18,370
That girl!

431
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,250
Honey, you should iron the lining too, right?

432
00:37:26,395 --> 00:37:30,565
Justice Girl Geum Jan Di hasn't died yet.

433
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:34,569
Outcast in this way, outcast in that way, and thrown about anyway!

434
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:37,739
I will say what's on my mind!

435
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:39,800
F4,

436
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,110
starting tomorrow, you're all dead!

437
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:59,527
It's F4!

438
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:35,797
Joon Pyo Sunbae, I baked this myself for you.

439
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:39,568
Please accept my heart.

440
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,620
- Wow.
- Look at her.

441
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:04,526
Our Joon Pyo only eats cakes made by top-notch patisseries.

442
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,556
Who are you?

443
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:38,627
You have something to say?

444
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,800
Yes, I have something to say!

445
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,230
I have a lot to say!

446
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:46,528
You!

447
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,167
Do you have absolutely no respect for people?

448
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:55,339
I don't even expect you to have humility being a rich person.

449
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:58,809
If you didn't want to eat it, then you could have rejected it nicely or...

450
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:03,046
will it kill you to accept it by thinking of that person's effort?

451
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:08,552
What are you going to do if she says she'll jump off the roof, you bastard!

452
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:10,421
Who are you?

453
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,593
You have something to say?

454
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:26,970
No.

455
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,420
♫ When things get hard, lucky in my life  ♫

456
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,470
♫ You come towards my life like a dream ♫

457
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:06,250
♫ When I get sad, lucky in my dream ♫

458
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:14,550
♫ You hold me tight in your warm embrace ♫

459
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:20,600
♫ I smile like this, always ♫

460
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,650
♫ Even when the world makes it hard ♫

461
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,890
♫ I don't want to show my tears ♫

462
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:37,670
♫ Even though you don't know my heart yet ♫

463
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:42,000
♫ Because I can still keep your smile, even from afar, it's a relief ♫

464
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,515
Why are you swimming so hard? You'll become exhausted and faint.

465
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:47,417
It's punishment.

466
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,052
Punishment?

467
00:41:49,853 --> 00:41:52,255
What did you do that was so bad?

468
00:41:52,255 --> 00:41:57,193
It's the punishment that the Justice Girl inflicts upon the super subservient.

469
00:41:59,028 --> 00:42:01,831
So, do you feel better?

470
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:03,534
Yes.

471
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:08,738
The reasons why I'm going to this school are right here.

472
00:42:09,506 --> 00:42:11,207
What are they?

473
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:15,490
The swimming pool and

474
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,510
Oh Min Ji.

475
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,040
The ice-cream is delicious.

476
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:46,678
Sun... Sunbaenim!

477
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:52,949
I'm so sorry, Joon Pyo Sunbaenim.

478
00:42:54,618 --> 00:42:56,285
Sorry?

479
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,740
If an apology solved everything,

480

you shouldn't try to use the American style here.

00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,600
$25!

643
01:00:17,086 --> 01:00:19,255
"Bon apetit!"

644
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:30,399
What's up, man?

645
01:00:30,399 --> 01:00:33,703
They only accept one group per week here.

646
01:00:33,703 --> 01:00:39,041
I made reservations a month ago, and I'm still waiting, so...

647
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:41,010
how did you do it?

648
01:00:59,362 --> 01:01:01,497
This one is better.

649
01:01:01,497 --> 01:01:05,868
You're right. It's a beauty.

650
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:08,505
Enough to make your cuisine even finer.

651
01:01:08,505 --> 01:01:11,707
And just who told you that I was a chef?

652
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:19,249
Your... delicious-looking hands.

653
01:01:31,594 --> 01:01:33,830
Do players know things just by looking at a woman's hand?

654
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:37,233
You at least need to know she's a chef at Michelin in order to be a player.

655
01:01:37,233 --> 01:01:39,835
Of course. My bro, yo!

656
01:01:53,616 --> 01:01:55,120
Yeah.

657
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,680
Are you doing what I told you to do?

658
01:01:59,055 --> 01:02:01,680
Don't make a mistake and do it correctly.

659
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,420
Understand?

660
01:02:13,536 --> 01:02:15,237
Let's eat.

661
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:17,750
All right.

662
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,270
Cheers!

663
01:02:28,918 --> 01:02:30,053
Mom!

664
01:02:30,053 --> 01:02:31,240
You must be crazy!

665
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,890
Everyone is dying to lose weight, but,

666
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,359
here you are stuffing your face?

667
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:39,095
Will you be happy if I die doing such a worthless thing?

668
01:02:39,095 --> 01:02:44,734
Hey! You need to diet and at least have a killer body, so the rich boys will notice you!

669
01:02:44,734 --> 01:02:48,671
Really! We're not rich, we don't have a good family background, nor are we smart!

670
01:02:48,671 --> 01:02:50,773
What are you talking about? Is dieting worthless?

671
01:02:50,773 --> 01:02:52,408
Give me the rice container!

672
01:02:52,408 --> 01:02:53,730
No, I can't.

673
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:57,760
Right now, surviving is more important than dieting to me.

674
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:02,785
In this day and age, even swimmers must be skinny to become stars!

675
01:03:02,785 --> 01:03:04,460
Haven't you seen Kim Yeon Na?

676
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,690
You're a young girl, how can you not know the trends?

677
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,092
Give me the rice container!

678
01:03:09,092 --> 01:03:11,260
Mom! I said I don't want to!

679
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,795
Give it to me!

680
01:03:12,795 --> 01:03:14,196
Hey, you!

681
01:03:14,196 --> 01:03:16,899
Mom, Kim Yeon Na is a figure skater.

682
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:20,403
Kim Yeon Na is a figure skater, not a swimmer!

683
01:03:20,403 --> 01:03:23,310
Stop! You!

684
01:03:26,438 --> 01:03:28,644
Give up the rice container!

685
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:34,360
Jan Di? Jan Di?

686
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,850
The rice container... Jan Di!

687
01:03:51,334 --> 01:03:53,269
Has my stomach gotten bigger?

688
01:03:55,472 --> 01:03:57,540
A little bit.

689
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:01,677
I'm sorry. I haven't been able to take care of you.

690
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:07,183
I'm only putting up with this because of the swimming pool.

691
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:11,687
If I had attended this kind of school from the get-go, there's no doubt I would have been in the Olympics.

692
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:13,389
No doubt at all.

693
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,560
What the? What is this?

694
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,520
Goo Joon Pyo!

695
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:54,464
What's going on? You keep on smiling to yourself.

696
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:57,934
She's probably really pissed right about now.

697
01:04:57,934 --> 01:04:59,635
Who?

698
01:05:00,469 --> 01:05:04,273
Perhaps, the laundry girl? Still?

699
01:05:04,273 --> 01:05:07,143
Wait a minute, how long has it been?

700
01:05:07,143 --> 01:05:09,111
It's been over a week.

701
01:05:09,111 --> 01:05:13,649
Okay, hand them over, the girls' phone numbers.

702
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:15,051
She's really something.

703
01:05:15,051 --> 01:05:20,356
Wait, isn't she the first girl who really stood up to the F4?

704
01:05:20,356 --> 01:05:21,690
What are you saying?

705
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:24,960
It's only because I'm going easy on her.

706
01:05:25,995 --> 01:05:27,597
But, how come Ji Hoo is not here again?

707
01:05:27,597 --> 01:05:30,966
He's probably sleeping somewhere.

708
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,830
Gosh!

709
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,770
One, two...

710
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,610
Let me go!

711
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:00,130
Let go! Let go!

712
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:05,260
♫ Shout to the world, "I love you..." ♫

713
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:09,220
♫ "...I love you, be my woman" ♫

714
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:12,890
♫ You are blinding. Always you're my star ♫

715
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:16,750
♫ I'll protect you ♫

716
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:21,060
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

717
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,880
♫ Let's make one promise ♫

718
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,230
What? You couldn't find that one thing? What the hell are you guys?

719
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:30,270
It says that someone got pregnant at Noona's school!

720
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,310
What?

721
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:34,840
Guys! Can you smell something strange?

722
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,170
Hey! Geum Jan Di!

723
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:41,460
Doing this to a girl is stupid and childish.

724
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:45,270
One of them seems to be different.

725
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,460
Who?

726
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,770
I think that girl

727
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:54,090
has completely fallen for me, head over heels.

728
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:55,180
What?

729
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,740
Good looking, tall, smart and rich.

730
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,560
What is there not to like about me?

731
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,910
Are you really that dumb?

732
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,280
You have someone waiting for you.

733
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,700
Who?

734
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,850
A prince.

735
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,840
This is a dream, right?

736
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,740
I don't know what is gonna happen, but it is getting interesting, don't you think?

737
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,920
Why the heck are you here?

738
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,530
Why shouldn't I be in my own house?

739
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:26,970
Every time I see you, you are very annoying and noisy.

740
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,250
Do Ji Hoo Sunbae

741
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:33,150
and the model Min Seo Hyun know each other?

742
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:38,590
For Ji Hoo, she's like his first love, his lover, a mother.

743
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:41,580
Geum Jan Di!

744
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,640
Joon Pyo... Goo Joon Pyo sunbae fell into the pool!

745
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,330
Goo Joon Pyo! Wake up!

746
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:54,950
♫ You are blinding. Always you're my star ♫

747
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:58,720
♫ I'll protect you ♫

748
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:03,190
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

749
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:06,860
♫ We only need to make one promise ♫

750
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,300
♫ I'm always swearing on the Heavens ♫

751
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:17,020
♫ I'll keep loving you until the very sun burns out ♫

752
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,730
♫ Oh My Love ♫

753
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:27,250
♫ I pray you allow me this, that you accept me as your man ♫

754
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:32,360
♫ I promise that my heart will not change to my final day ♫
