♫ I don't know myself well either ♫

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,010
♫ I didn't know I would do this ♫

♫ I keep looking for you ♫

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,467
How did you do this?

12
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:01,730
Didn't I tell you?

13
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,370
Every day, you can enjoy things you can't even imagine.

14
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:09,845
Jan Di Baht, you act so strong but get touched by such trivial things?

15
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:11,547
This was trivial?

16
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:15,440
If you're done being mushy, let's get to the point.

17
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:18,219
The... the point?

18
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:25,894
What are you doing right now?

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,365
Don't-don't take off your clothes!

20
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,070
Is he up to something?

21
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:43,912
You! Don't take your clothes off! I'll do... I'll kill you!

22
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,370
You! If you take off your pants, too... I'll really kill you!

23
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,930
I told you not to take them off!

24
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,600
Pervert!

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,794
Hey!! I told you not to take them off!

26
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:01,096
Dummy.

27
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,850
Come here, you dummy.

28
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,400
Do you want to die? Surprising people like that?

29
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:24,719
Goo Joon Pyo, don't move. Wait there!

30
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,090
- What's wrong?
- Don't move!

31
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,490
What is it? What's wrong?

32
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:38,600
There... there's a snake by your leg.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,101
What?

34
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:43,380
By your leg...

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,242
By your leg... snake!

36
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:51,413
I really hate snakes!

37
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:53,930
Oh god!

38
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,223
You run well, Goo Joon Pyo. Run more!

39
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,830
What?

40
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,790
Go on! Run farther! You're doing well!

41
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:25,046
Madam... the juice you ordered is here.

42
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:26,882
Put it over there...

43
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:29,130
Okay.

44
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,360
Enjoy.

45
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,490
Tip.

46
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,893
Thank you, madam.

47
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,370
- Wait a second.
- Yes ma'am.

48
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,000
If you have the time, why don't you rub this on for me?

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,005
That would be my specialty, Madam.

50
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,112
Mom!

51
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:03,100
The chicken store's owner said if you are not going to order chicken then to put the parasol back.

52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,453
What?

53
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,780
One whole chicken?

54
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,010
Do you know how much chicken soup you could buy with that?

55
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,661
Strike! Strike!

56
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:15,439
Then how about this...

57
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:20,763
Hey, Gang San.

58
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:23,605
My sweet Gang San.

59
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:27,041
What are you doing to him?

60
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:45,861
Do you want me to put it on for you?

61
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:47,929
No, thanks!

62
00:04:55,537 --> 00:05:00,675
My baby, your skin is just like a baby's skin.

63
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,510
What the heck?

64
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:09,060
Jan Di! Jan Di!

65
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:13,321
Hey, that's enough, come out now!

66
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:20,940
Jan Di!

67
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:24,760
Stop it now!

68
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,710
Seriously...

69
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:37,860
Jan Di! What's wrong?

70
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,748
- Jan Di!
- What is it?

71
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:42,170
Jan Di!

72
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,450
What should I do?

73
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,655
What? What's going on?

74
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,930
Something is wrong with Jan Di.

75
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,220
Cramps, maybe she got cramps!

76
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:56,340
Jan Di!

77
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,200
Jan Di!

78
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,040
Jan Di, wake up! Wake up!

79
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:17,046
Are you okay?

80
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,600
Mrs. Chairwoman.

81
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,260
Where did JunPyo go?

82
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,331
According to the report from the private plane, he left for New Caledonia at 5pm.

83
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,632
Why did he go there?

84
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:14,602
He went for some fresh air and for a weekend trip.

85
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,720
I got it.

86
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,780
Hold on.

87
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:23,410
Did you check who else went with him?

88
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:29,717
Yes, I did. As usual, he went with the F4.

89
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,280
F4...

90
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,240
When is he ever going to quit being the leader of that childish group?

91
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,928
You can leave.

92
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:20,640
Help me! Mom, Dad,

93
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,200
Noona, help me!

94
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:31,680
For someone who is so well off, how come he doesn't know how to swim?

95
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,616
- He was kidnapped when he was 8 years old.
- What?

96
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,360
When he was young, there was this guy who looked after him instead of his parents.

97
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,188
He was a bodyguard and a driver.

98
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,757
So that person was the criminal?

99
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:46,394
The police were chasing after a car, and it crashed into the water.

100
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:47,795
No way!

101
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,799
Yeah, Joon Pyo was in that car.

102
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,790
Oh, medium, okay?

103
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,440
Okay.

104
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,620
♫ Is passing by me now ♫

105
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,610
♫ In my heart ♫

106
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,990
♫ Perhaps there's only the sunlight that shines you ♫

107
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,090
♫ Even pain and wounds are embraced ♫

108
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,297
What happened?

109
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:26,104
I just gave some extra consideration in preparing something for you guys.

110
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:29,204
Well, I guess this is for someone else though.

111
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:31,405
Who cares.

112
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,574
- It looks delicious!
- Come here.

113
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:36,130
Why? Let go of me!

114
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,060
Ah, it hurts!

115
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:42,283
This is all for you.

116
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,987
Do you see me as some kind of Godzilla?

117
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:49,518
It's good for your health, so eat it.

118
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:53,422
You're always eating some kind of weird bugs. That's why you are getting cramps in your legs.

119
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:54,957
Weird bugs?

120
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:58,961
Anyway, does it make sense for a swimmer to drown?

121
00:10:58,961 --> 00:11:01,397
If all of a sudden you get a cramp, then it does make sense.

122
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:06,000
Rat or cat, I won't allow you to be weak when you're with me.
(T/N: the word for rat and cramp is the same)

123
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,490
So stop talking so much, and just eat it, okay?

124
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,920
Here.

125
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,880
♫ Love you, love you, love you. Forever ♫

126
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,820
♫ I am walking, following you ♫

127
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,260
♫ I hide behind the moonlight there ♫

128
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:50,920
♫ What to do if you are so tactless? ♫

129
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,910
♫ For the rain to at least fall ♫

130
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,230
♫ Shall I request the clouds again? ♫

131
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,620
♫ So that I can hug your drenched heart ♫

132
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,310
♫ Love you ♫

133
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:12,280
♫ Recalling you now ♫

134
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,330
♫ I close my eyes again ♫

135
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:16,680
How are you?

136
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,670
Your girlfriend is not with you?

137
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:26,510
Give this flower to your girlfriend.

138
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,280
♫ I will bring everything and give it to you ♫

139
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,580
♫ I love you, if I could convey these feelings of mine ♫

140
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,480
♫ I love you, if you teach me how that feels ♫

141
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,250
♫ I'll follow all of that ♫

142
00:12:52,250 --> 00:13:01,480
♫ Love you, love you, love you, my dear ♫

143
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:06,555
Are you going to eat all of that?

144
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,526
But JunPyo doesn't like plump girls.

145
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,728
What?

146
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:17,550
But the pajamas in my luggage will probably be a lot of help.

147
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,268
Pajamas?

148
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:26,609
Right now he is into Jan Di, but with his personality, nobody knows what will happen.

149
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:28,611
What are you saying?

150
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:31,710
Guys that get rejected become weak...

151
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,390
I believe you can compete against it. Good luck!

152
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:39,955
What in the world are you saying right now?

153
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:44,058
Ga Eul, don't you like Joon Pyo?

154
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,760
Oh my God.

155
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,330
Look here, I have my own tastes too you know.

156
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:56,138
Then why were you so upset that an accident was going to happen between Joon Pyo and Jan Di?

157
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:05,080
Unless... you like Jan Di?

158
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,951
Well there's someone Jan Di likes.

159
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:17,540
Hey, So Yi Jung, come over here.

160
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,480
Hurry.

161
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,750
♫ Yes yes yo ♫

162
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,480
♫ I love you (Forever you) ♫

163
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,270
♫ I love you (Only you) ♫

164
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,040
♫ I love you (Just as you are) ♫

165
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,430
♫ I love you, my heart goes bang bang boom when I see you ♫

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,200
♫ I stay up all night because of the excitement ♫

167
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,190
♫ I style myself up moderately oh yeah ♫

168
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,760
♫ My scooter which is shinier ♫

169
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,880
♫ This road also welcomes you, way ♫

170
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,870
♫ The sun shines over us ♫

171
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:07,490
Show time!

172
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,930
♫ I gather up my courage and say ♫

173
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,080
♫ I love you more than anyone else in this world ♫

174
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,280
♫ I want only you ♫

175
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,120
♫ I won't hurt you ♫

176
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,190
♫ I want to have only you ♫

177
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,370
Goo Joon Pyo,

178
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,970
from now on, I'll put you on the player's list.

179
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,480
♫ Lady who captivates me in a second ♫

180
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,790
♫ My heart's like a dynamite that'll burst
Yes yes yo oh ♫

181
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,460
♫ Oh, get up, bigger, stand up, my heart's fluttering ♫

182
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,290
♫ Oh, the closer I get to you, the intense my feelings get,
bang bang boom ♫

183
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,990
♫ The sun shines over us ♫

184
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,880
♫ I want to confess now ♫

185
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,490
♫ I gather up my courage and say
I love you more than anyone else in this world ♫

186
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:25,400
What is she doing in there?

187
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,840
I thought you had passed out in there.

188
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,890
Were you scrubbing yourself or something? What took you so long?

189
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,466
You!

190
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:45,400
This jerk wants to die! He's so dead!

191
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,678
This isn't your room, it's my room!

192
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:51,047
Did I say it wasn't?

193
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:53,747
Then why are you here?

194
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,918
Do you really think I would show up here for no reason?

195
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:59,160
Reason?

196
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,010
What reason?

197
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:10,250
You're losing something important.

198
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,700
Important?

199
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,801
As a woman.

200
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:19,141
As a woman. Could it be...

201
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:35,280
Goo Joon Pyo, really, what are you doing?

202
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,832
Cheap things look good on you.

203
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,640
You're here to give me this?

204
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,444
What? Did you think I was going to do something to you?

205
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,850
I wouldn't mess around with a girl that didn't love me.

206
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,250
Close the door tight an sleep. Lizards may come in otherwise.

207
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,000
Even though it's cheap, if you lose it you're dead!

208
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,950
Geez!

209
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,390
Ga Eul, are you awake?

210
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:01,120
Ga Eul, are you sleeping?

211
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,000
Ga Eul!

212
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:11,110
Do you know the meaning of this flower?

213
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,300
Without a doubt,

214
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,080
happiness will come.

215
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:25,160
That is why it's only given to the person you love.

216
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:28,640
You know about it.

217
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:31,733
From today, at the market.

218
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:36,210
I used to come here often with her.

219
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,170
She said it was similar to Nice, so she liked it.

220
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,490
Is she doing well?

221
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:49,585
I guess she's doing well.

222
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,457
Did something happen?

223
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:59,628
Why did you tell me to follow her?

224
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:01,620
That's because...

225
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:10,610
I found out what a pathetic man I was.

226
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,860
All day long in an empty apartment.

227
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:20,048
There was nothing else to do besides wait.

228
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:25,007
But, just being able to be together would've been enough.

229
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:29,080
Do you know what it feels like to be a burden

230
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,210
to the one you love?

231
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:37,887
A no-good, lousy guy.

232
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:39,126
What I meant was...

233
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:41,090
You're right.

234
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,370
I...

235
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,820
Besides loving a girl out of habit,

236
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:55,070
I'm a pathetic guy who doesn't know how to do anything else.

237
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:03,746
Take it.

238
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,110
I can't accept it.

239
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,400
This belongs to Seo Hyun unnie. Sunbae, you should give it to her personally.

240
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,760
I'll get going.

241
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,230
Sunbae, you'll catch a cold if you stay out for too long.

242
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,960
♫ Because I'm stupid ♫

243
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,920
I'm cold.

244
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,990
I'm so cold that I can't handle it anymore.

245
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,160
♫ You wouldn't know how I feel ♫

246
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,420
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

247
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,660
♫ I wouldn't even be in your memory ♫

248
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,870
♫ I still keep looking at you only ♫

249
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:09,120
♫ My tears keep rolling ♫

250
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,320
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

251
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,470
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

252
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,780
♫ "I miss you" plays on my mouth ♫

253
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,550
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

254
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,340
Why didn't you tell me where you were going? I was worried!

255
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,580
Am I a kid?

256
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,940
I can take walks by myself!

257
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:47,060
I thought of the worst, that maybe you fell in the water or got bit by a snake!

258
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,380
How could I not be worried?

259
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,790
Goo Joon Pyo!

260
00:23:57,884 --> 00:23:59,580
I'm sorry.

261
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,390
You...

262
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,140
From now on, don't go swimming alone.

263
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:19,381
Don't even take walks alone.

264
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:21,216
Understood?

265
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,211
What?

266
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:45,200
It's hot. Be careful.

267
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:47,969
Do you want some?

268
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:50,172
No, it's okay.

269
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,876
- Where is it?
- What?

270
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:03,770
The thing I gave you.

271
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:07,500
Ah, that.

272
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,540
I left it in the room.

273
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,990
You think you'd let me be if I lost it while running around?

274
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:16,810
As long as you know, it's fine.

275
00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:24,599
Grab it tightly.

276
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,970
Tighter.

277
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,060
♫ Stand by me, look at me ♫

278
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,540
♫ I might not know love yet ♫

279
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,780
♫ Stand by me, watch over me ♫

280
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,100
♫ I think I'm still not good with love ♫

281
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,410
♫ The more I see you, my mood gets better ♫

282
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,740
♫ I sing unknowingly ♫

283
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,070
♫ I want to buy a rose ♫

284
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,350
♫ Such a side of myself surprises me ♫

285
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,680
♫ I feel like my heart is going to you ♫

286
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,040
♫ This world is beautiful ♫

287
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,430
♫ If you feel this excitement too ♫

288
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:19,500
♫ Can you please wait for me? ♫

289
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,050
♫ Together make it love. Forever make it your smile ♫

290
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,260
♫ Full of your bright smile ♫

291
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,740
♫ Together make it love. Forever make it your smile ♫

292
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,600
♫ Now hold my hand, my hand ♫

293
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,030
What is that? It doesn't suit you.

294
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:50,190
Is that so?

295
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:53,120
You like it?

296
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,826
- What is it?
- It belongs to Jan Di.

297
00:28:57,826 --> 00:29:01,263
She dropped it last night, pass it along to her for me.

298
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,200
Play ball!

299
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,677
Goo Joon Pyo, why didn't you pass?

300
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:28,540
Am I a kid?

301
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,930
I can take walks by myself!

302
00:29:32,961 --> 00:29:35,370
Ah, that.

303
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,510
I left it in the room.

304
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,170
You think you'd let me be if I lost it while running around?

305
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,220
Joon Pyo! The ball!

306
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:55,050
Joon Pyo! Are you all right?

307
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,510
I'm fine. I'm fine.

308
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm fine

309
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:08,557
Where did Ji Hoo go?

310
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:10,526
That way.

311
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,626
Are you going somewhere?

312
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:36,029
- Fishing.
- With this boat?

313
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:38,190
With this white sail and the wind,

314
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,860
we can go anywhere.

315
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:46,973
Do you wanna go too?

316
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:48,278
Is that okay?

317
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:52,845
Is that okay?
If you promise that you won't be noisy and scare the fish away.

318
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,580
♫ Because I'm stupid ♫

319
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,830
♫ I know no one but you ♫

320
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:18,070
♫ But you are looking at someone else ♫

321
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:22,560
♫ You wouldn't know how I feel ♫

322
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:28,140
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

323
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,816
You let this go.

324
00:34:29,816 --> 00:34:31,245
Just let it go like that?

325
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:33,940
For something that lived here for so long,

326
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,420

Is it true that Geum Jan Di likes another guy?

It's probably some low-life.

I know a little about women, and girls like Geum Jan Di

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,370
are attracted to bad boys.

351
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:45,184
Guys like that like to leech off of strong women like Jan Di and suck everything out of them.

352
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:50,620
Nonsense! That guy might be Jan Di's soulmate.

353
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:59,031
Soulmate?

354
00:36:59,031 --> 00:37:01,667
That's why it isn't working out with them.

355

Do you actually believe in such a thing?

356
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,440
Of course! Definitely!

357
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,820
Playboys like you wouldn't understand,

358
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,160
but that one person does exist in this universe.

359
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,300
So, have you met yours, Ga Eul?

360

Your soulmate?

361

Not yet,

362
00:37:22,922 --> 00:37:27,300
but if he appears, I'm not letting him go.

363

An emergency regarding Ji Hoo.

392
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:10,657
Here.

393
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,270
He's an elite politician.

394
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:21,467
And he might be the next prime minister.

395
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:24,490
Ji Hoo seems to have known about this since before he came back from Paris.

396
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,339
I didn't see him this afternoon.

397
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:29,210
His stuff is still in his room.

398
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,644
What should we do?

399
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:35,748
He's going to be fine. I know him.

400
00:40:47,427 --> 00:40:51,930
Your prince, now I understand why he's changed.

401
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:54,967
Ga Eul...

402
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:56,469
What should I do?

403
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:58,160
What?

404
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:02,220
What I said before, it's coming true.

405
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,540
Ji Hoo sunbae is going to really hate me.

406
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:22,450
I hope she marries someone of royalty

407
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,913
or someone who may become president.

408
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:29,380
Like Diana or Audrey Hepburn.

409
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,380
To be a princess who contributes to world peace.

410
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,400
Something like that.

411
00:41:37,176 --> 00:41:39,460
She's just a model.

412
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:42,400
Why does that matter?

413
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,719
The president of France divorced so he could marry a model.

414
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,080
Who knows,

415
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:54,590
a French President or an European prince might pick unnie.

416
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:10,843
How did you get in here?

417
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:13,513
Have you forgotten who owns this place?

418
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:25,727
Geum Jan Di.

419
00:42:27,763 --> 00:42:29,670
My heart...

420
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,310
you understand right?

421
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:37,106
What?

422
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:54,857
Don't keep me waiting too long.

423
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,340
Is it true?

424
00:43:40,635 --> 00:43:43,170
It's just a rumor, right?

425
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,740
It's just a false report, right?

426
00:43:48,778 --> 00:43:51,213
I'm sorry.

427
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:53,882
Really...

428
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:59,522
I guess you just knew her better than me.

429
00:43:59,522 --> 00:44:01,390
Sunbae.

430
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,100
He is a man fit for Seo Hyun.

431
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:07,663
I can't even be compared to him.

432
00:44:07,663 --> 00:44:11,667
That's not true! There's no way for it to be true!

433
00:44:33,622 --> 00:44:38,093
Please, be happy.

434
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,963
Tell me that you will be.

435
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:49,810
Because if you are unhappy,

436
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,270
then I'll be unhappy too.

437
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:56,412
Why couldn't I have fallen for a girl like you?

438
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:38,100
So,

439
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,650
this is how it is?

440
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:53,097
Goo Joon Pyo, don't do this! This...

441
00:45:53,097 --> 00:45:54,830
This what?

442
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,110
You didn't know about this either?

443
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,640
Did you fall for another trap?

444
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:04,850
I wanted to believe you,

445
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,840
I didn't want to regret later on, so I tried my best.

446
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,760
I'm sorry. It's...

447
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,820
I showed you my heart.

448
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,740
But...

449
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,100
Is this your answer?

450
00:46:28,037 --> 00:46:32,040
It's not like that. It's not...

451
00:46:39,915 --> 00:46:42,285
Now, this time, it really is the end.

452
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:49,191
Geum JanDi, let's not meet ever again.

453
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:56,364
- Joon Pyo!
- Shut up!

454

455
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,240
I'll kill you.

456
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,330
Yes. Okay.

457
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,300
Where did he go?

458
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,110
What time did he leave?

459
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,620
Yes. What?

460
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,550
I got it.

461
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:46,916
What? He really left?

462
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:50,819
Yeah, by jet at dawn.

463
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:55,024
Crazy fool. What is he thinking?

464
00:47:55,024 --> 00:47:57,358
Geum Jan Di.

465
00:47:57,358 --> 00:47:59,828
Do you know anything about this?

466
00:48:11,635 --> 00:48:13,542
JanDi!

[Jan Di Dry Cleaners]

468
00:48:50,412 --> 00:48:52,720
I'm home!

469
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,550
Oh my god!

470
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,551
Jan Di!

471
00:48:56,551 --> 00:48:58,610
Jan Di! Jan Di.

472
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,689
- You must be exhausted.
- My daughter.

473
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,980
This was your first vacation overseas,

474
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,410
and on a private plane across the Pacific Ocean!

475
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,432
What kind of blessing was this?

476
00:49:10,432 --> 00:49:11,920
It's been hard on you, my daughter.

477
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,137
Seeing that you have this many prospects, I can die in peace!

478
00:49:15,137 --> 00:49:17,940
Why do you have to die? It's only the beginning.

479
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:23,145
If Jan Di becomes part of that house, she'll have everything. She'll live without regrets.

480
00:49:23,145 --> 00:49:25,717
- I have a lot of regrets.
- Honey...

481
00:49:25,717 --> 00:49:29,150
Noona, does that island really belongs to Joon Pyo Hyungnim?
(T
: hyungnim = brother-in-law)

482
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,484
Really? It's theirs?

There's nothing Shinhwa Group doesn't have!

484
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:36,025
- He's a prince!
- A prince?

485
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:38,480
Then, if Jan Di got married, what would she become?

486
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,167
- A princess.
- Princess?

487
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,200
Please calm down, the prince's mother-in-law.

488
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,935
Will I become the prince's mother-in-law?

489
00:49:46,935 --> 00:49:49,505
Dad, dad, then what would I be?

490
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:54,460
When you see the historical dramas, the brother of the princess is always causing trouble...

491
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,414
Geum Gang San, be careful!

492
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:01,550
Well, you don't have to worry about any of that.

493
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,918
Why?

494
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:05,250
That household, no.

495
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:10,420
There's no reason for me to have any relation with Goo Joon Pyo.

496
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:16,932
Just wake up from your dream!

497
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,920
She!

498
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,240
Why is she saying that?

499
00:51:10,118 --> 00:51:12,090
That...

500
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,620
Isn't it pretty?

501
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,830
I bought it at a shack.

502
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:20,670
You're supposed to give this to the person you want to always be with.

503
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,066
Does it mean not to run away?

504
00:52:01,636 --> 00:52:04,106
Don't drink when I'm not around.

505
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:07,743
If it's snowing, you should go inside somewhere!

506
00:52:07,743 --> 00:52:09,960
I was waiting for you!

507
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,310
This is the first time I had to wait for someone in my entire life!

508
00:52:21,456 --> 00:52:23,491
Wow, it's a heart!

509
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:26,161
Do you see it? My heart?

510
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,770
Sorry.

511
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,860
I'm sorry, Goo Joon Pyo.

512
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:39,808
I'm sorry.

513
00:52:45,614 --> 00:52:47,516
Stay.

514
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:53,288
You don't have to worry about me...

515
00:52:53,288 --> 00:52:55,456
It seems you're in trouble too.

516
00:52:57,037 --> 00:53:02,312
You were always in trouble, weren't you?

517
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:06,579
I'm sorry for what happened at the island.

518
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:08,281
Why are you apologizing?

519
00:53:08,281 --> 00:53:10,417
If I didn't look for you...

520
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:14,987
I was the one who wanted to do that, and I'm the one who should be apologizing.

521
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:19,725
I was the one who hurt Goo Joon Pyo.

522
00:53:40,513 --> 00:53:44,960
Joon Pyo must be looking like this right now.

523
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:47,990
Of course not.

524
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,980
Give it here.

525
00:53:57,297 --> 00:54:01,199
He's got this dirty look on his face,

526
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,910
and his face is steaming red.

527
00:54:05,669 --> 00:54:10,376
His hair is curly. Curly, curly...

528
00:54:34,968 --> 00:54:37,069
I'm sorry.

529
00:54:47,179 --> 00:54:49,015
It's all right.

530
00:55:21,311 --> 00:55:26,251
On behalf of F4, I have an announcement.

531
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:33,893
From now on, Yoon Ji Hoo is no longer a part of F4.

532
00:55:33,893 --> 00:55:35,400
What?

533
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,362
Joon Pyo!

534
00:55:37,362 --> 00:55:41,510
And, in a week's time,

535
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:47,030
Yoon Ji Hoo and Geum Jan Di will be expelled from this school.

536
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,410
Expelled?

537
00:56:13,064 --> 00:56:13,966
Expelled?

538
00:56:13,966 --> 00:56:16,901
Yeah, expelled! Don't you understand what that means?

539
00:56:16,901 --> 00:56:17,974
You're being kicked out!

540
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:21,474
I don't care about you being kicked out, but

541
00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:24,980
because of someone like you, Ji Hoo is being kicked out of F4!

542
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,377
What are you going to do about that?

543
00:56:26,377 --> 00:56:31,751
It was the start of bad things happening the moment someone like you stepped foot in this school.

544
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:37,730
This is the first time Ji Hoo and Joon Pyo have come across a commoner.

545
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,960
They must have felt bad because they are so pure hearted. Take responsibility!

546
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,790
A cheap girl like you ripping F4 apart!

547
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,133
Take responsibility for everything!

548
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:50,603
I'll take that responsibility.

549
00:56:58,175 --> 00:56:59,312
What do you want me to do?

550
00:56:59,312 --> 00:57:02,415
Sunbae, are you in your right mind?

551
00:57:02,415 --> 00:57:05,250
Aren't you guys the ones who aren't in your right mind?

552
00:57:06,853 --> 00:57:09,160
Cheap girl?

553
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,891
When you guys talk like that, it seems like you're the ones who are cheap.

554
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:15,820
Sunbae! If you keep siding with her,

555
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,464
we can't be on your side anymore!

556
00:57:18,464 --> 00:57:20,633
Who asked you to be?

557
00:57:21,935 --> 00:57:25,404
You're going to regret this! Really!

558
00:57:36,882 --> 00:57:39,952
You can quit with that face now.

559
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:48,460
This time, both of us are in trouble.

560
00:57:52,132 --> 00:57:56,360
Well for me, it's okay to be expelled or kicked out, but for you,

561
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,905
sunbae, this can't happen to you.

562
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:03,142
Even if he's Goo Joon Pyo, he can't do that, right?

563
00:58:03,142 --> 00:58:05,010
Yes, he can.

564
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:08,430
There's Shinhwa Group behind Joon Pyo.

565
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:13,150
Did you forget whose school this is?

566
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:18,624
Don't make that face.

567
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:21,227
I won't sit back and do nothing while being attacked.

568
00:58:21,227 --> 00:58:24,929
Do you have a plan?

569
00:58:24,929 --> 00:58:26,960
I'll have to make one,

570
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,030
because now I have a reason to fight.

571
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:34,874
That's right...

572
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:39,678
I can't take the fact that you are being kicked out of F4 like this.

573
00:58:41,114 --> 00:58:43,148
You're not too bright.

574
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,087
Those things don't matter.

575
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:58,097
Again, that face.

576
00:59:15,148 --> 00:59:17,226
I'm home.

577
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,519
Come in.

578
00:59:22,088 --> 00:59:23,990
What's all this?

579
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:28,127
Where were you all this time? We're less on hands!

580
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,662
Hurry in, change up and come out!

581
00:59:29,662 --> 00:59:30,997
Why so suddenly?

582
00:59:30,997 --> 00:59:33,530
When one thing goes well, everything goes well.

583
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,130
It's all thanks to you, my daughter!

584
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:40,740
There's a rumor that if people get their uniforms cleaned here, they're going to meet handsome guys.

585
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,370
- What?
- Look.

586
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,230
Korean Girls' School, Han Gang Girls' School, Mun Hwa Girls' School,

587
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,914
they all come from even across Han Gang!

588
00:59:48,914 --> 00:59:51,960
We're striking it rich, rich!

589
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,420
I've heard about this before, but to experience it myself, this is the first time in my life!

590
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,958
Noona, I heard instead of Joon Pyo hyung, you're going out with a different F4 member, Yoon Ji Hoo.

591
00:59:58,958 --> 01:00:02,694
You! Where did you hear that from?

592
01:00:04,998 --> 01:00:08,233
It was the Shinhwa girls who brought their uniforms first.

593
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:12,620
Goo Joon Pyo or Yoon Ji Hoo, it doesn't matter.

594
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:17,643
Your admittance into Shinhwa High School is like a dream every day!

595
01:00:17,643 --> 01:00:20,710
Honey, I won't wake up from this dream tomorrow, right?

596
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:24,029
Hold on.

597
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:27,687
Ah, sorry. Honey, I told you everything would work out.

598
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,640
Shinhwa group aren't the only rich ones.

599
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,426
We are the Shinhwa in the dry cleaning business, we can be rich too!

600
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:40,933
Rich! Rich! Rich! Rich!

601
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:06,992
Speak.

602
01:01:07,693 --> 01:01:10,662
I always took your actions into consideration.

603
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:15,490
However I would question Joon Pyo's, I didn't think

604
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:18,300
I would have to talk to you like this.

605
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,339
It's unlike you not to get straight to the point.

606
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:24,142
- Why did you do it?
- I just wanted to.

607
01:01:24,142 --> 01:01:26,512
- Joon Pyo likes Jan Di.
- I knew that.

608
01:01:26,512 --> 01:01:28,747
Yoon Ji Hoo!

609
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:34,120
If you had seduced my younger sister and dumped her three days later, I wouldn't be this mad.

610
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,188
But you don't have a younger sister.

611
01:01:36,188 --> 01:01:38,460
This isn't a joke.

612
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,793
I'm saying to take a friend's girl is crossing the line.

613
01:01:42,793 --> 01:01:44,330
I feel bad for Joon Pyo too, but...

614
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:45,764
But what?

615
01:01:45,764 --> 01:01:49,100
I can't let him expel her like that.

616
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,410
So what are you going to do?

617
01:01:53,337 --> 01:01:55,674
I will have to do whatever I can.

618
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,940
I'm warning you on this,

619
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,640
this time there won't be anyone on your side.

620
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,610
Don't be disappointed.

621
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,704
I know how you feel Joon Pyo,

622
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:28,873
but expelling is just too much.

623
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:30,242
Too much?

624
01:02:30,242 --> 01:02:34,379
It'll be too much when I kill them all.

625
01:02:39,185 --> 01:02:41,887
Ji Hoo is not in his right mind right now.

626
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:44,460
You know what Seo Hyun was to him.

627
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,410
With his personality, he followed her to Paris.

628
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:51,362
An unexpected marriage would definitely make him crazy.

629
01:02:51,362 --> 01:02:53,320
You're right.

630
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,700
It's not because he truly liked Geum Jan Di.

631
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,840
He used her because of Seo Hyun.

632
01:03:01,606 --> 01:03:05,344
That's even more unforgivable. You know that?

633
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:12,240
Joon Pyo...

634
01:03:12,983 --> 01:03:15,440
You can't take his side anymore.

635
01:03:17,556 --> 01:03:20,259
Say one more thing and you'll be kicked out as well.

636
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,470
♫ I know I shouldn't feel this way ♫

637
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:30,880
♫ A lie... If I said it was a lie ♫

638
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,110
♫ Will my heart come back to me? ♫

639
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,060
♫ Tears are falling ♫

640
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,910
♫ I can't look at you because I feel sorry ♫

641
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,920
♫ My heart aches ♫

642
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:46,530
♫ What should my first words be?
I can't think ♫

643
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,120
Let Jan Di go.

644
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,807
What will you do if I let her go?

645
01:03:49,807 --> 01:03:50,975
I'll protect her.

646
01:03:50,975 --> 01:03:54,620
You were the friend I watched this movie with 11 times. If you remembered,

647
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:57,740
this wouldn't have happened.

648
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:03,187
You're stupid! How am I suppose to get into the water?!

649
01:04:03,187 --> 01:04:05,856
Whether they win or lose, it isn't your business.

Don't you know how glad I am that Joon Pyo has such friends?

653
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:19,303
The heir of Shinhwa Group doesn't need friends.

01:04:19,303 --> 01:04:22,439
It's not too late.

01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:35,480
I will definitely not regret it.
