Grandpa, why do you ask for things like that at a porridge restaurant?

Even though I can only think of the times we fought,

166
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,417
whenever I think of you, I smile.

167
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,395
Goo Joon Pyo,

168
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:44,934
you're doing well, right?

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,072
When are you going to come fight with me?

170
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:20,170
♫ Among the people passing by ♫

171
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:27,320
♫ I wanted to find you before anyone else ♫

172
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:34,340
♫ Your eyes and voice that seemed like you were about to cry ♫

173
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:41,350
♫ I just feel like I want to hug you ♫

174
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:48,220
♫ I missed you, I miss you when I call you ♫

175
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:56,310
♫ Wherever in the world, it's you ♫

176
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:01,450
♫ I try calling you again, ♫

177
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,070
♫ like this, because it's you, ♫

178
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,670
♫ because it's you whom I love ♫

179
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,410
♫ I'm going to meet you now ♫

180
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,430
♫ The one who taught me ♫

181
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:25,450
♫ love deeper than tears ♫

182
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:32,810
♫ was you ♫

183
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,774
You find me irresistable don't you?

184
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,649
There's yet to be a girl that hasn't fallen for me after seeing me like this.

185
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,984
Who's fallen for who?

186
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,421
I came here because I have something to say.

187
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,756
About Joon Pyo and Jan Di?

188
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,326
Yes.

189
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,065
Tell me...

190
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,502
About?

191
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:10,937
You still haven't changed your mind about waiting for the one person of your destiny?

192
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,009
That doesn't have anything to do with this.

193
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,949
Do you think Joon Pyo is really Jan Di's partner in life?

194
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,154
Eternal partners or soulmates? Can that be right?

195
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,189
That...

196
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,994
Miss Ga Eul, you're applying your beliefs to Geum Jan Di.

197
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,430
What do you mean?

198
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,468
If it were me, I'd use that time to search for my own soulmate.

199
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,280
Though,

200
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,770
I don't really know if such a thing exists.

201
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,850
It seems like I shouldn't have come here,

202
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,810
so I'll take my leave.

203
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,295
Sunbae, you believe in it too, don't you?

204
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,632
Soulmates.

205
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:13,635
That uncertained true love that you'll spend the rest of your life with.

206
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:18,407
I think that you also believe that such a true love exists.

207
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,010
What?

208
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,747
They say a strong "no" is "yes".

209
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,350
I think I get it now.

210
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,422
Sunbae, you do believe that it exists?

211
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:34,990
You're scared that it does maybe exist.

212
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,959
Why is that?

213
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,428
Don't act like you know everything about me.

214
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,035
For the first time, it feels as though you're just like everyone else.

215
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,538
It's a good thing I came here.

216
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,043
We'll talk about Jan Di next time.

217
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:55,745
Well, goodbye.

218
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,272
Enjoy your meal.

219
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,257
HEY YOU!

220
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:45,428
Half of the appeal in the nine combo platter comes out in its look.

221
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:47,329
But look at this color! The color!

222
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,898
It looks delicious.

223
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,701
You two can try it too.

224
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,869
Really?

225
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,988
It's delicious!

226
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,096
You! Did you do your homework?

227
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,432
Homework ?

228
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:24,266
Yes.

229
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,372
Oh, the phone's ringing.

230
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,476
Ji Hoo sunbae?

231
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:38,180
Now?

232
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,751
Just a minute.

233
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:59,668
Sunbae.

234
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:06,542
Aigoo, all I've done was ruin my appetite.

235
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,277
Excuse me.

236
00:21:08,277 --> 00:21:10,512
What?!

237
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:13,116
What shall I make for you next time?

238
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:15,940
What do you mean next time?!

239
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,243
The one dish that you're most confident in making.

240
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:23,047
One that you feel is even more superior than the dishes of your father.

241
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,940
Okay!

242
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,820
This brat.

243
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,091
What's wrong?

244
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,693
There's a place you have to go.

245
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,194
Where?

246
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,100
You'll know when we get there.

247
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,545
Your shoulder is badly damaged.

248
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,990
Why didn't you get it checked out when it happened?

249
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,919
If you start treatment right away, you won't experience any future difficulties.

250
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,740
But swimming is...

251
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:14,092
I know...

252
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,730
That I'm not pretty,

253
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,266
not smart,

254
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,510
and that I don't have money.

255
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,450
But,

256
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,343
there was just one thing

257
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,981
that I liked more than anything else,

258
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:40,051
and I was good at.

259
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,994
They say I'm not supposed to do it anymore.

260
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,764
Swimming.

261
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,167
I'm never supposed to swim again.

262
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,485
What am I going to do now?

263
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,725
What do I do from now on?

264
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,533
You can start searching again, for something else you like.

265
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:35,473
Sunbae, you have your music.

266
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:40,277
Yi Jung sunbae has his pottery.

267
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:45,416
Goo Joon Pyo and Woo Bin sunbae will be inheriting businesses.

268
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,757
Everyone is following the road that they were meant to take.

269
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,695
But I don't know what I'm supposed to do now.

270
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,688
I'll help you.

271
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,892
I'll help you.

272
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:30,028
Let's find it together.

273
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,430
Sit down.

274
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:21,079
It was because of me.

275
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,680
That accident.

276
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:26,017
Pardon?

277
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,186
I can vaguely remember that

278
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:32,423
I was in the backseat, playing around.

279
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:35,593
And I covered my father's eyes when he was driving.

280
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,096
They said they wrapped their arms around me to protect me.

281
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,734
Everyone said it was a miracle.

282
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,637
And eventually, Grandpa

283
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:49,307
stopped coming to this house.

284
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:56,110
He probably didn't want to see the grandchild who killed his son.

285
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:02,220
At that point,

286
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,223
she took my hand and helped me start over again.

287
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,924
That person.

288
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,313
Now, I think

289
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,283
it's my turn.

290
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,400
What are you doing?

291
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,102
Is this all you were capable of (for showing love), sunbae?

292
00:28:58,102 --> 00:28:59,937
Go after her!

293
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:04,942
If she can't stay here with you, then you should go being with her!

294
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:09,181
If you really love her... is waiting around the way you'll show her how much you love her?

295
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,516
Can you still say you love her after all this?

296
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:42,680
Ga Eul, I made this new dish. What do you think of it?

297
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,648
Well...

298
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:47,631
This has to do well.

299
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,276
Is it good?

300
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,910
Um,

301
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,540
can you give me an advance?

302
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:00,398
An advance.

303
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,267
Jan Di, is your dad in trouble again?

304
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:04,902
No.

305
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:07,138
I just need it for something.

306
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,070
How much do you need?

307
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,210
￦ 2,000,000 ($2,000).

308
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,680
What are you going to with 2 million won?

309
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,516
It's for a plane ticket.

310
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,800
A plane ticket?

311
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:23,621
Are you by any chance...

312
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,680
Jan Di, don't you see this?

313
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,229
For a flower boy, his skin is his life.

314
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:34,865
But mine became rough because of stress.

315
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:37,535
I'd love to give it to you if I could,

316
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,337
but I can't before this becomes a hit.

317
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,100
This tastes good.

318
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,646
If I sell one, I can get 500 won, right?

319
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,223
If it's 100, 50,000 won ($50).

320
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:52,750
If we sell 1000...

321
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,351
500,000 won ($500)!

322
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:55,320
Aja!

323
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,522
Guys, here.

324
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,794
E.S.

325
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,828
What does ES mean?

326
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:07,464
Enjoy Selling.

327
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,761
Fighting!

328
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:10,968
Fighting!

329
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:13,504
Healthy abalone porridge, here!

Are you really going to take responsibility?

347
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,480
Of course!

348
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:27,030
♫ I'm just blaming the time that has passed ♫

349
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,730

Good job.

365
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,087
I think you should do the count, Jan Di.

366
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,053
I didn't know that we could make this much money.

367
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,353
But, I didn't earn all this money all by myself.

368
00:33:37,353 --> 00:33:39,053
Is it okay for me to keep it all?

369
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:40,720
You can keep it.

370
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,320
It was pretty fun for us, too.

371
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,580
But... Why did you guys come here all of the sudden?

372
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:54,020
There's a place that you need to go with us.

373
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,720
Swimmer, to your mark.

374
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,520
Get ready.

375
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,280
Start!

376
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:35,830
From now on.

377
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:42,787
Beginning now, we will begin Swimmer Geum Jan Di's

378
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:45,853
retirement ceremony.

379
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,030
First, we will present our distinguished service award.

380
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,440
Oh...

381
00:36:55,987 --> 00:37:00,487
Shinhwa High School's Distinguished Service Award is presented to Geum Jan Di.

382
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:04,153
Based on her natural nosiness

383
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:08,153
and the weed spirit as the only student

384
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:12,653
with special ability in swimming at the fiercely prestigious aristocratic Shinhwa High school,

385
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:16,253
especially with the specialty of taming the F4 and Goo Joon Pyo,

386
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:19,053
she is second to none,

387
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:24,220
thus raising the standards for her sportsmanship and therefore awarded Distinguished Service

388
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,687
by Korea's F4 members.

389
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:43,496
Geum Jan Di,

390
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:47,853
an ending means another beginning. You know that, don't you?

391
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:50,253
Now go to Macau, to Joon Pyo,

392
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:53,700
and give it to him good.

393
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:56,687
Thank you!

394
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:58,460
Jan Di,

395
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,753
have a safe trip.

396
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:09,153
I will.

397
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,220
Hey, come here!

398
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,420
One hundred dollars to Macau, okay?

399
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,560
$100?

400
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,880
Taxi?

401
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:41,987
$100, very cheap.

402
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,330
Macau. Yes? Okay?

403
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:48,320
Wait, wait.

404
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:59,670
19,700 won?!

405
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,820
I'm sorry.

406
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,597
Thank you.

407
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,587
It`s too expensive! How can I ride a taxi for 19,700 won?

408
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,187
Bus. BUS!

409
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:25,820
Bus, wait!

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,420
They say this is the place to be, but now I can really feel it.

00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:35,520
Where's the entrance?

470
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:51,598
Wow, this is it.

How much?

473
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:05,395
Give her wallet back while I'm still being polite about it.

474
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:11,150
W, wal, let, my wallet!

475
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,090
My wallet?

476
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,364
Ohh, thief!

477
00:46:14,364 --> 00:46:16,624
He's a thief!

478
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:19,400
Are you Korean? Thank you.

479
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,110
Stay put.

480
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:28,089
Hey, you! You speak English?

481
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:30,465
I'm a black belt holder of Taekwondo.

482
00:46:30,465 --> 00:46:33,120
You know? You know Taekwondo?

483
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,820
Fine.

484
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,705
Come on, just let her go while things can still end well. You're just making things worse.

485
00:46:37,705 --> 00:46:39,211
Why don't you hurry up and let go of her?

486
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:41,536
Your crime is getting more and more serious.

487
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:45,302
Before you were just a thief. Now you're holding someone as a hostage.

488
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,050
Go! Go away!!

489
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,040
Ahh, what a really annoying man.

490
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,343
I gave you a chance, okay?

491
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:55,350
If you blame me later, you're really a loser, got it?

492
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,664
When I say 1, 2, 3 bite his arm and run!

493
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:01,450
Don't you know Korean??

494
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,352
Yes. Of course I know.

495
00:47:03,352 --> 00:47:04,526
1, 2...

496
00:47:04,526 --> 00:47:07,231
- Oh, wait a sec!
- Why?

497
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:11,672
Do I bite after the count of 3 or on 3?

498
00:47:11,672 --> 00:47:14,424
You're a funny one, aren't you?

499
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:17,540
One, two, three! Now!

500
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:22,100
You're dead!

501
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:38,182
- Your wallet.
- Thank you!

502
00:47:47,283 --> 00:47:50,290
Come on, let's go. If we get caught it's going to be a pain for us.

503
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,670
It's him.

504
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,970
I don't know how I can thank you.

505
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:09,080
Now I know what it's like to meet another Korean when traveling abroad.

506
00:48:09,861 --> 00:48:11,685
This is your first time abroad?

507
00:48:11,685 --> 00:48:14,418
It's my first time by myself.

508
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:17,600
Why Macau?

509
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,535
I'm looking for someone.

510
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:22,610
Ahh, it must be your boyfriend.

511
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:25,931
Ahh, ye. Kind of.

512
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:28,206
I envy you!

513
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:30,219
Well, it's not always something to be envious of.

514
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:31,607
Ahh! That's right.

515
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:34,136
Honey, you were going to buy jerky, right?

516
00:48:34,136 --> 00:48:35,800
Follow me.

517
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,853
Honey?

518
00:48:39,853 --> 00:48:41,527
Me?!

519
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:58,750
Mmmm, tastes good.

520
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:03,933
Hmm, very delicious!

521
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:05,854
One is ten dollars?

522
00:49:05,854 --> 00:49:07,287
Yes.

523
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:10,320
If I buy ten, can you give me a discount?

524
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,187
How about seventy dollars?

525
00:49:12,187 --> 00:49:13,726
No way, no way.

526
00:49:13,726 --> 00:49:15,141
Hey, I'm not buying it then.

527
00:49:15,141 --> 00:49:16,795
I'm not buying it then.

528
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:19,253
Ahh, okay, okay, okay, very well then.

529
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:20,787
Ten pieces.

530
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,927
Okay, 70 dollars then.

531
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:30,222
I saved $30 off the price by buying yours and mine together.

532
00:49:30,222 --> 00:49:33,480
See, there's no business that can't be negotiated.

533
00:49:54,777 --> 00:49:56,880
It was nice to meet you!

534
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,330
Be careful.

535
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,360
You can say that again.

536
00:50:04,124 --> 00:50:06,223
Hey! Wait!

537
00:50:06,223 --> 00:50:07,895
Can I at least know your name?

538
00:50:07,895 --> 00:50:11,610
Me?? Jae Kyung. Ha Jae Kyung.

539
00:50:12,662 --> 00:50:15,010
Oh, Ha Jae Kyung!

540
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:23,753
Hey! Wait! My name is Geum Jan Di!

541
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,982
Is this a hotel or a cathedral?

542
00:53:28,089 --> 00:53:30,831
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

543
00:53:30,831 --> 00:53:33,020
Oh, ok.

544
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,950
Ok.

545
00:53:58,063 --> 00:53:59,763
Sorry.

546
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:16,628
He didn't see me.

547
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,515
Even if he did see me, he probably thought it wasn't me.

548
00:54:19,515 --> 00:54:23,344
Yes, of course. It's weird that I came to Macau all of a sudden.

549
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,457
That's really weird.

550
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:28,730
It's weird, weird, it's just weird.

551
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,590
Weird.

552
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:57,753
Are you okay, young master?

553
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:58,953
About what?!

554
00:54:58,953 --> 00:55:01,230
Just now, Geum Jan Di.

555
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,284
When will the JK Group be arriving?

556
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:08,874
If that goes wrong, the old witch might just kill me,

557
00:55:08,874 --> 00:55:10,901
so please take care of it.

558
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,116
Hi.

559
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,983
Hotel! Cheap!

560
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:40,521
Cheap! Ssayo, Ssa! (It's cheap)

561
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:43,304
You have a cheap room?

562
00:55:45,149 --> 00:55:47,852
That's all right, I'll carry it myself.

563
00:55:47,852 --> 00:55:50,486
Oh that's all right. I'll carry it.

564
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,195
Ohh, follow me.

565
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:56,133
Okay.

566
00:56:09,797 --> 00:56:11,894
Hey, hey!

567
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,790
You stop right there! Do you hear me?!

568
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,160
You! You are so dead!

569
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,920
You're dead meat!

570
00:56:23,197 --> 00:56:25,780
Stop! Stop!

571
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:27,710
Stop right there!

572
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:30,092
Give me back my bag!

573
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:37,208
I have a little brother like you,

574
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,819
so I will give you a chance.

575
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:40,219
So will you give me my bag?!

576
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:42,284
You! Idiot!

577
00:56:42,284 --> 00:56:46,357
Ahh really! Do you really want to die?!

578
00:56:46,357 --> 00:56:48,420
Let go! LET GO!

579
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,210
Let go!

580
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,960
Let go!

581
00:56:55,485 --> 00:56:57,890
Ahh, this is really!

582
00:56:58,476 --> 00:56:59,476
What's this?!

583
00:56:59,476 --> 00:57:01,866
Looking at you, you're probably worth 3,000 at most.

584
00:57:01,866 --> 00:57:04,557
If you're obedient,

585
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:08,823
it'll make things easier for you from now on.

586
00:57:10,623 --> 00:57:13,072
Ohh. Ahh! Help-pp me!

587
00:57:13,072 --> 00:57:14,640
Help me!!! help me!! Ahhhh!

588
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,433
Help me! Goo Joon Pyo!

589
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:26,360
♫ Almost paradise ♫

590
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,330
♫ Warmer even than the sun,  ♫

591
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:34,110
♫ the way you look at me ♫

592
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:37,170
♫ Feels like I have the whole world ♫

593
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:43,560
♫ In my life, in my tiring life, like a light ♫

594
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,440
♫ you came to me ♫

595
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:52,180
♫ If I could treasure your love forever ♫

596
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,960
♫ I bet my everything  ♫

597
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,930
♫  and love you ♫

598
00:58:02,715 --> 00:58:04,922
Do you guys know "Il Shil Hweh"?

599
00:58:04,922 --> 00:58:06,757
What?

600
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:09,557
- Are you Prince Song?
- Yeah.

601
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:17,151
I'm sorry... forgive us.

602
00:58:17,151 --> 00:58:18,790
Forgive us.

603
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,283
Hurry, get lost!

604
00:58:20,283 --> 00:58:22,283
Let's go.

605
00:58:35,609 --> 00:58:37,659
What's going on?

606
00:58:37,659 --> 00:58:39,559
I just knew.

607
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,528
I just knew you would be crying like this.

608
00:59:09,723 --> 00:59:13,161
Joon Pyo must be really busy.

609
00:59:13,161 --> 00:59:16,605
Even though we're here, he's not able to rework his schedule.

610
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:20,607
What? You don't think he's actually matured after all this time, do you?

611
00:59:20,607 --> 00:59:22,675
Remember, his father passed away.

612
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:25,566
Even if he did mature, it couldn't be helped.

613
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:28,267
It's just hitting me, but it feels kind of sad.

614
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:29,467
What does?

615
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:31,490
He's not part of F4 anymore.

616
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:34,686
He's now the owner of the Shinhwa Group.

617
00:59:36,025 --> 00:59:39,583
Hey, Jan Di... Were you able to meet Joon Pyo yet?

618
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:42,399
Pardon?

619
00:59:42,399 --> 00:59:44,923
I haven't met him.

620
00:59:44,923 --> 00:59:47,182
He looked really busy and stressed.

621
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:49,657
How could I meet him?

622
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:52,690
Then how do you know that he's busy and stressed?

623
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:55,788
Ah, that...

624
00:59:55,788 --> 00:59:58,767
A hunch, just a hunch.

625
00:59:58,767 --> 01:00:01,397
He has to take care of all of this.

626
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:04,257
It would be strange if he weren't busy.

627
01:00:04,961 --> 01:00:07,061
In any case, I'm sure we'll eventually get to see him.

628
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,800
While we're waiting, should we loosen up a bit?

629
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,566
Okay! Let's go!

630
01:00:12,566 --> 01:00:13,966
Let's go.

631
01:00:18,688 --> 01:00:21,647
Manager Kim will report the rest.

632
01:00:21,647 --> 01:00:23,228
When the reports are finished.

633
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:25,028
Alright sir.

634
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:36,400
♫ Because I'm stupid ♫

635
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,620
♫ I know no one but you ♫

636
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,850
♫ But you are looking at someone else ♫

637
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:50,200
♫ You wouldn't know how I feel ♫

638
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,430
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

639
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:57,600
♫ I wouldn't even be in your memory ♫

640
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,780
♫ I still keep looking at you only ♫

641
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:06,670
♫ My tears keep rolling ♫

642
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,370
♫ Your backside ♫

643
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,580
♫ Looking at that is also a happiness ♫

644
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,810
♫ If you still don't know how I feel ♫

645
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:24,340
♫ If I stop this and go too ♫

646
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:29,450
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

647
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:33,710
♫ On the days that it's too hard to handle ♫

648
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:37,990
♫ "I love you" plays on my mouth ♫

649
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:42,220
♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

650
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:46,460
♫ Alone again, missing for you ♫

651
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:51,910
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

652
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,160
♫ I wouldn't be in your day ♫

653
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,280
♫ You wouldn't even remember me ♫

654
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,510
♫ I still keep looking at you only ♫

655
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:10,550
♫ I keep making memories on my own ♫

656
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:14,060
♫ Love to me ♫

657
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:18,380
♫ Is like a beautiful wound ♫

658
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,600
♫ Even if I see your pretty smile, ♫

659
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:28,950
♫ I can't even smile with you ♫

660
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:33,260
♫ On the days that I think of you too much ♫

661
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:37,370
♫ On the days that my chest hurts and it's sad ♫

662
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:41,700
♫ "I miss you" plays on my mouth ♫

663
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,930
♫ Alone again, crying for you ♫

664
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:50,150
♫ Alone again, missing for you ♫

665
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:55,070
♫ Baby, I love you, I'm waiting for you ♫

666
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,630
♫ Bye, bye never say good bye ♫

667
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:02,880
♫ I can't hold you like this (can't hold you) ♫

668
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,170
♫ I need you, I can't say anything, I want you ♫

669
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:13,440
♫ even if I hope again and again ♫

670
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,685
♫ On the days that I miss you too much ♫

671
01:03:16,685 --> 01:03:20,123
You should make a bit of time for your F4 friends...

672
01:03:20,123 --> 01:03:21,530
Am I really that free?

673
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:24,446
Do you think I want to change my schedule and play around with them?

674
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:27,706
Apart from that, that guy really has gotten weird.

675
01:03:27,706 --> 01:03:32,449
Whatever he has to say, I came to hear it directly from Goo Joon Pyo.

676
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:34,257
I have to meet him.

677
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:36,664
Are you telling the truth?

678
01:03:36,664 --> 01:03:39,629
I was always this kind of person,

679
01:03:39,629 --> 01:03:41,974
I was just pretending not to be.

680
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:46,039
Hey, ugly girl there, buy me some ice cream!

681
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:48,245
Give me this one day.

682
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:51,570
Ji Hoo, do you like her?

683
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,533
What?

684
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:56,767
When Ji Hoo looks at the girl, he smiles.

685
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:58,462
Get on my back.

686
01:03:58,462 --> 01:04:01,862
Because of you, I've done many things that I never would have done.

687
01:04:01,862 --> 01:04:05,369
So now, thank you.
