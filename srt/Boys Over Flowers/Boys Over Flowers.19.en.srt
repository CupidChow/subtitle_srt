00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,320
Goo Joon Pyo!

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,900
Hey you again!

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,480
I told you there's a connection between us.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,680
I just knew that if I came by your house, I would be able to see you.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,400
Did you boil your cell phone or something?

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,280
You are supposed to call and get permission from the owner before comming to visit someone's house.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,000
Don't you know that?

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,360
I'm tired.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,140
Come to think of it, I don't remember learning anything like that.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,200
Joon Pyo, how about you?

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,716
Hey, monkey! Aren't you getting up?

17
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:54,220
Why are you lying on my bed?

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
Get up, hurry.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,640
Get up, hurry!

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,920
Get up! Get up!

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,980
Do you want to make a bet with me?

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,720
What kind of bet?

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,220
Oh! No, no, no!

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,480
Please win.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,010
Please win!

26
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,680
I won!

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,740
I'll let you try again.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,340
Please win!

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,240
- I won again!
- Why don't you ever win?

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm not playing this anymore!

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Play it yourself. What is this?!

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,840
Stop drinking that.

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,680
It's going to hinder your recovery.

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,280
Recovery?

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,700
What does it matter if I don't get better soon?

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,060
So what if it's hindering me from making a few bowls?

37
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,220
I am probably going to continue living as a womanizer.

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,000
Aren't I?

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,000
Yi Jung, until now, you've been doing well. Why are you being like this?

40
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,760
Young master.

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,864
Your mother has again...

42
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:53,760
What happened?

43
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,120
She's doing okay at the hospital, but...

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
she is asking for you, young master.

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Tell her I'm busy.

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,240
Where are you going?

47
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,180
If you don't want to see me go crazy, leave me alone.

48
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,600
Ga Eul.

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,780
You said you wanted to go on a date with me, right?

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,420
Is that offer still good?

51
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,780
If you want to walk away like this, then you shouldn't have asked me for a date.

52
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,220
The highlight of the night has yet to come.

53
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,860
Did you say your name is Ga Eul?

54
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,540
Take your time and enjoy the food.

55
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,380
The foie gras (duck) here is the best.

56
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,100
Thank you.

57
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,900
It seems that you like Ga Eul.

58
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,940
Of course, how can I not like a cute young lady like Ga Eul?

59
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,500
I guess I'm just like you after all.

60
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,220
The mother is in the hospital, but the son is out on a date instead of being there.

61
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,300
You don't care if your wife is alive or dead,

62
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,180
but you dine on fois gras with a young lady.

63
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,120
I guess the apple really doesn't fall that far from the tree, does it?

64
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,920
Let's talk about our family later.

65
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,200
Then what should we talk about?

66
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,560
You seem to take a liking to this lady, shall I lend her to you?

67
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,960
Yi Jung sunbae.

68
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,420
Why are you so formal and proper?

69
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,340
She's about the same age as your former girlfriend.

70
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,380
What do you think, Ga Eul?

71
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,760
Is my father okay for you?

72
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,200
Please, excuse me.

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,200
Today, you were the one who went overboard, my son.

74
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,140
Why are we here?

75
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,020
The loser needs to shut his mouth. Did you forget the wager?

76
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,938
You agreed to be my servant today.

77
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:10,360
When did I?

78
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,920
Wow! What I really hate is someone who goes back on their word.

79
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,380
Have you heard a man's word is as good as blood?

80
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,940
A man's word is as good as a blond?

81
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,380
Don't talk, just follow me.

82
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,720
A man's word is as good as a blond?

83
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,840

You really buy that?

108

- Thank you.
- He's just trying to sell this thing we're eating.

- No, he's not!

Hey, monkey. This is...

112
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,820
Jan Di moved to a new house.

113
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,980
She's living alone with her brother. I was concerned. So, I went to see her.

114
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,880
Let's go.

115
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,580
Here.

116
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,020
I've been on the receiving end of things again.

117
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,280
Today, I got something in return, too.

118
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:10,560
Would you like to come in and have a cup of tea?

119
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,360
At least, I can offer you warm green tea.

120
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,460
Ah, grandfather, ah, h-he has already gone home.

121
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,780
Wait for a moment. I'll just prepare the tea.

Are you having fun, Ji Hoo?

125
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,280
Yeah, grandpa!

126
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,480
Let's go fishing!

127
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
I'll catch a gigantic shark.

128
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,480
Fishing? Okay Ji Hoo, when should we go?

129
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,040
Right now.

130
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,840
Okay, let's go.

131
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,960
Wow, it smells so good.

132
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,240
Me first!!

133
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,540
How dare you? You're going to eat it all in the blink of an eye.

134
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,560
What?

135
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,980
Little bro, this girl is a glutton. Hurry up and eat.

136
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,400
That can't be, of course. Whose money was used to buy all this?

137
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,140
Hey! That's it for you!

138
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,580
Why aren't you eating?

139
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,500
Because I'm tired of always only eating ramen.

140
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,980
What do you want to eat besides ramen?

141
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,520
Pizza!

142
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,740
I wouldn't have any other wishes if I could eat pizza the whole day.

143
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,920
What a small wish!

144
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,340
Ah! Don't eat!

145
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,340
You should eat something good.

146
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,700
Ah! I'm so full.

147
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,940
By the way, why isn't Jan Di home yet?

148
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,140
Little brother, try calling.

149
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,080
Sister doesn't have a cellphone.

150
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,600
What?! She doesn't have a cellphone anymore?

151
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,180
She gave it to my parents when they left, for emergencies.

152
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,460
You guys are really...

153
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,920
Oh, I see.

154
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,840
Let's go!

155
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,100
Where to?

156
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,780
What?

157
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,610
Come quick!

158
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,330
Hello.

159
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,720
- I will take this.
- You mean this product?

160
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
Just a moment please.

161
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,980
It was this! This is what I told you!

162
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,640
- Mister, please let me have a look at this.
- Oh, that's what I want!

163
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,880
Oh, sorry. We came first.

164
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,660
Yo! CEO!

165
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,830
I guess you are not just CEO for show.

166
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,360
Good job, boy!

167
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,460
Excuse me, the one that I was talking about earlier on.

168
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,300
Ji Hoo.

169
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,340
Excuse me.

170
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,980
Ji Hoo! I was wrong.

171
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,660
What are you talking about?

172
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,860
It was all my fault.

173
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,880
I killed your beloved son and daughter-in-law,

174
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,660
and survived alone.

175
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,920
You probably hated me.

176
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,060
It wasn't your fault.

177
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,820
It was my fault.

178
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,580
Ji Hoo!

179
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,280
15 years...

180
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,640
You should have said that 15 years ago.

181
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,740
Do you know?

182
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
That child,

183
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,280
how long that child waited for his grandfather?

184
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,340
- Ji Hoo.
- You didn't know, did you?

185
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,400
That child.

186
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,820
Do you know how much that child longed to cry in his grandfather's arms?

187
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,360
My grandson...

188
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,920
Please never call me that again.

189
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,880
Ji Hoo!

190
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,860
Grandfather!

191
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,860
Grandfather, Grandfather!

192
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,280
I'm fine. Follow him. Hurry.

193
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,040
That child... Hurry.

194
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,860
Go on.

195
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,280
Ji Hoo Sunbae!

196
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,200
Ji Hoo Sunbae!

197
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,920
Grandfather!

198
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,520
Grandfather!

199
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,080
Grandfather! Grandfather!

200
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,140
Grandfather!

201
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,620
Because of me that kid may be crying.

202
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,980
I was scared.

203
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,940
Like father...

204
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,940
Like mother.

205
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,680
That kid may be crying because of me.

206
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,300
I ran away.

207
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:50,190
♫ It's so hard. From a step back ♫

208
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:57,060
♫ Watching you like this ♫

209
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:06,200
♫ Because of my tears, because I'm missing you ♫

210
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,290
♫ You are fading ♫

211
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:21,250
♫ Can we go back to how things were before ♫

212
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,810
♫ When I didn't even know your name ♫

213
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:37,260
♫ I just look at you a little longer ♫

214
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,400
♫ I don't see anyone else but you ♫

215
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:53,410
♫ I'll look at you just for today ♫

216
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,350
♫ I'll forget you tomorrow ♫

217
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,910
♫ I promise ♫

218
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:29,460
♫ I tried to erase them, but the stained memories ♫

219
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,480
♫ just keep spreading ♫

220
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,400
♫ Can we go back to how things were before ♫

221
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:52,090
♫ When I didn't even know your name ♫

222
00:25:52,090 --> 00:26:00,440
♫ I just look at you a little longer ♫

223
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,580
♫ I don't see anyone else but you ♫

224
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:16,580

225
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,510

226
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,370
♫ I promise ♫

227
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,280
♫ Will I be able to endure it ♫

228
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:38,470
♫ I don't know, but I have to leave ♫

229
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:46,970
♫ I love you, I love you. I've never said it ♫

230
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:54,010
♫ I had to keep it inside and erase it ♫

231
00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:03,190
♫ Just like that, living without you ♫

232
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,140
♫ Always, in my heart ♫

233
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:14,130
♫ You are ♫

234
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,220
What kind of girl comes home at this hour?

235
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,220
Ah. That is...

236
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,990
Why am I explaining myself? It's not like I've done anything wrong.

237
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,290
It's my life!

238
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,160
You don't even know the word "privacy"?

239
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,800
Hey, Geum Jan Di, if you want to say something, say it properly.

240
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,340
It is not privacy but p-r-i-d-e.

241
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't you even know what pride is?

242
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,900
What?

243
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,640
Hey, where are you going when someone is talking to you?

244
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,980
Whether it is privacy or pride,

245
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,420
I am going to school to find out. What do you want?!

246
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,920
You really aren't going to tell me what you have been doing and where?

247
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,800
I won't!

248
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,220
Really!

249
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,030
I can't even ask anyone.

250
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,940
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

251
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,800
What about Joon Pyo?

252
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,528
He went to school.

253
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:58,960
How are things with Joon Pyo and Jae Kyung?

254
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,320
When you were not around, she came often and spent time with young master.

255
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,260
Oh, did she? That's a relief.

256
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,540
By the way...

257
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,820
Do you have anything else to report to me?

258
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,740
Yes?

259
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,880
Secretary Jang,

260
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,800
I know that you are busy supporting our family in my place.

261
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,460
But both you and I know that Joon Pyo is not the type of person to give up easily.

262
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,040
It is too early to think that he has given up on her. Don't you think?

263
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,820
I am sorry.

264
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,980
It is my mistake to miss something like this.

265
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,800
- Check it out right now.
- Yes, President.

266
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,000
What a pain this must be for you!

267
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Why don't you just return to your old neighborhood?

268
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,880
I told you it's training for getting used to an independent and wild lifestyle.

269
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,580
But you go back there for every meal with your chauffeur, you even go back there to change your clothes.

270
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,340
Which part of that is "wild and independent?"

271
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,480
Sleeping! I spend the nights here.

272
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,420
I spend nights here in this tiny room where I can't even stretch my long legs out with roaches and all kinds of bugs.

273
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,980
Who told you to do that?

274
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,520
No one asked you to do that.

275
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,859
Don't make your life so difficult!

276
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:11,400
Are you really not going to tell me?

277
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,240
What?!

278
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,400
I, what...

279
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,420
I'm not asking because I'm curious about your pride, or privacy.

280
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,940
It is because I am like your guardian.

281
00:33:24,911 --> 00:33:27,520
I'm not done talking to you.

282
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,580
Are you Geum Kang San?

283
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,720
Yes, I am Geum Kang San.

284
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,580
Please come this way.

285
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,380
[Kang San, cheer up ^^]

286
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,740
[Enjoy it.]

287
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,260
I granted your wish. Now eat as much as you want.

288
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,420
Joon Pyo hyungnim?

289
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,680
Is it good?

290
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:41,480
Eat a lot.

291
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,500
Kang San!

292
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,690
- Let me have some too!
- Me too!

293
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,300
Stand in line!

294
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,440
Welcome!

295
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,600
Ji Hoo Sunbae.

296
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,980
What brings you here?

297
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,950
I went to Jan Di's house and...

298
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,700
Ah! You still don't know.

299
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,920
Jan Di has already moved.

300
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,560
She moved?

301
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,640
You guys eat a lot, too.

302
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:55,266
It bugs me even when he (Joon Pyo) is too quiet.

303
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:12,500
Hey! Why aren't you turning on?

304
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,140
Secretary Jang, it's me.

305
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,120
I can't turn it on.

306
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,920
What can it be! I'm talking about the stove! The stove!

307
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,280
It doesn't turn on!

308
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,380
Come here quickly and do something about this!

309
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,040
That was quick.

310
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,420
Secretary Jang.

311
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,840
Let go! Aish!

312
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,810
Hey! I said let go!

313
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,120
Get your hands off of me!

314
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,140
Get your hands off of me!

315
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,180
Hey, just let me go!

316
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,160
Kang San.

317
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,680
Who is it?

318
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,620
- Hello!
- Hey, yo!

319
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:00,720
Sunbae!

320
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,460
How did you guys find out?

321
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:14,260
We heard you moved, so we're here for a housewarming party.

322
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,920
The owner of the house has to invite you for there to be a housewarming party.

323
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,600
But do you two really live in this kind of place?

324
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,560
It's better than it looks.

325
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,720
It is quiet and safe.

326
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,220
The rent is quite cheap.

327
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,700
Almost free!

328
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,940
But, Joon Pyo...

329
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,940
Excuse me.

330
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,840
Who can it be?

331
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,280
Geum Jan Di, you're pretty popular.

332
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,300
Hold on a minute.

333
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,240
Who is it? Who is it?

334
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,120
How did they get here?

335
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,480
I can hardly believe my eyes seeing you boys here at this late hour.

336
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,540
Joon Pyo is not here.

337
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,960
I know where my son is and what he is doing.

338
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,860
What is the reason that you're here?

339
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:52,700
Even a commoner like you should know that it's etiquette to greet elders and ask them to come inside.

340
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,820
So I am saying that family education is important.

341
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,540
Then, would you like to come inside?

342
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,180
Forget it.

343
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,540
I prefer staying out here rather than stepping a foot inside.

344
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,380
I knew you weren't an average girl but I guess you excel in seducing men.

345
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,280
Chairwoman, it's not that but...

346
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,420
If I'm wrong about this misunderstanding,

347
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,120
then please, tell me what your excuse is.

348
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,960
I've done nothing wrong. I don't owe you an excuse.

349
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,580
I find that hard to believe after you've been caught red handed after what had just happened.

350
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,560
Is it not wrong to seduce someone who is engaged?

351
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,600
Well, isn't it?

352
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,540
I really have nothing to do with that.

353
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,540
It was all Goo Joon Pyo's idea.

354
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,960
Right, that's the typical excuse from girls like you, "I didn't do anything, he is the one who did it."

355
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,360
What am I supposed to do when he is the one who started it?

356
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,920
That's why I am here for a favor.

357
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,660
Even if my Joon Pyo comes to see you, please don't see him.

358
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,580
Like you said, my Jun Pyo and you, Jan Di,

359
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,700
are now two people who have nothing to do with each other.

360
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,280
Can I believe that?

361
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,820
Please make me believe that Jan Di has pride.

362
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,860
This is why,

363
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,730
I will not allow you guys to hang out with Joon Pyo.

364
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,340
Please think of my family and come to your senses!

365
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,080
- Lets go, Secretary Jang.
- Yes, Madam.

366
00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:56,560
Geum Jan Di, don't take Joon Pyo's mother's words to heart.

367
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,600
She's normally like that.

368
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,180
She's like that to us, too.

369
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,520
But what is this talk about Joon Pyo?

370
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,500
Let's go.

371
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,980
What is all this?

372
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,880
Geum Jan Di, it's our gift for your new house!

373
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,100
Ready!

374
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,330
♫ Stand by me, look at me ♫

375
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,750
♫ I might not know love yet ♫

376
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,020
♫ Stand by me, watch over me ♫

377
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,710
♫ I think I'm still not good with love ♫

378
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,140
♫ The more I see you, my mood gets better ♫

379
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,380
♫ I sing unknowingly ♫

380
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,710
♫ I want to buy a rose ♫

381
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:49,090
♫ Such a side of myself surprises me ♫

382
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:53,430
♫ I feel like my heart is going to you ♫

383
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:57,720
♫ This world is beautiful ♫

384
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,010
♫ If you feel this excitement too ♫

385
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:08,230
♫ Can you please wait for me? ♫

386
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,800
♫ Together make it love. Forever make it your smile ♫

387
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,910
♫ Full of your bright smile ♫

388
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:21,510
♫ Together make it love. Forever make it your smile ♫

389
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:25,840
♫ Now hold my hand, my hand ♫

390
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,060
♫ Stand by me, look at me ♫

391
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,740
♫ I might not know love yet ♫

392
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,840
♫ Stand by me, watch over me ♫

393
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,300
♫ Although I'm still not good with love ♫

394
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,410
♫ Stand by me, watch over me ♫

395
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:53,140
♫ Although I'm still not good with love ♫

396
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,940
The President said that you are grounded for a while.

397
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,780
I suggest that you should watch out for a while.

398
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,580
How the hell did that witch find out?

399
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,220
I wasn't cautious enough.

400
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,100
I'm sorry.

401
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,160
Miss Jae Kyung is here.

402
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,500
Why is that monster here again?

403
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,600
Why did I come? What's so strange about a fiancée going to her fiancé's house?

404
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,980
I am not in the mood to amuse you.

405
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,089
Just go.

406
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:42,080
Really? I wanted to ask you along to Jan Di's house.

407
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,000
I guess you can't then.

408
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,560
Then I will go alone.

409
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,020
Where did you say you were going?

410
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,690
Jan Di's house. We had ramen at her place yesterday.

411
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,440
I want to give this to her.

412
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,020
- I can go if you beg, but...
- Really?

413
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,680
But if the witch asks about it, say it's you.

414
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,100
Don't worry about that. I already told her we're going on a date.

415
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,940
Let's go!

416
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,200
Ah, it's troublesome!

417
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,840
Let's go!

418
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,560
Quick! Wear your clothes, quick!

419
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,060
Kang San, do you want more sausage?

420
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,100
He's sleeping.

421
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:37,020
San, if you sleep like that you won't grow. Get up.

422
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,240
San.

423
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,920
Ah! I feel good.

424
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,220
This kind of mood... It's been a long time.

425
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,600
Isn't it like we are camping?

426
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,160
Since we're bored...

427
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,240
Wait, you're not asking about a kiss, right?

428
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,720
You can do that in front of me, don't worry.

429
00:49:04,246 --> 00:49:06,260
Shall we play a game?

430
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,880
Game?

431
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,920
It's something that you have to do on a MT (bonding trip with coworkers or school friends).

432
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,300
What's that?

433
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,940
Truth or dare.

434
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,840
Truth or dare?

435
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,520
Me too! Me too! Me too!

436
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,400
You can ask a question to anyone you want.

437
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,660
How do you know whether it is true or false?

438
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,060
You can't lie.

439
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,620
But there is a "no comment" option.

440
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,900
"No comment" option?

441
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,060
Let's say, if you don't want to answer the question, you can, as punishment...

442
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,220
Give a kiss!

443
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:56,720
Jae Kyung, why would you say something like that?

444
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,880
Why not? It'll be fun!

445
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,140
Fine, then you have to do a french kiss.

446
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,740
No way!

447
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,100
Ok, then, a kiss on the forehead?

448
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,380
That should be fine, right?

449
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,980
If not... Getting hit?

450
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,500
That's also great.

451
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,080
Just... kiss.

452
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:38,480
Me?

453
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,860
Yoon Ji Hoo.

454
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:53,140
Other than Seo Hyun, is there anyone else you thought you could love?

455
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,280
For the first time in a long time, I have the desire to.

456
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,940
What?

457
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,840
Hey! That wasn't even a hard one!

458
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,500
Hey don't come over!

459
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,580
Go away!

460
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,800
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

461
00:51:47,863 --> 00:51:49,660
Joon Pyo,

462
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,640
if the person you love is suffering because of you,

463
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,580
would you let her go?

464
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,400
No.

465
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,600
I don't let go. I can't let go.

466
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,100
I would hold on tightly to her

467
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,000
and definitely make her happy.

468
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:31,660
Now it's me, right?

469
00:52:32,786 --> 00:52:34,460
Geum Jan Di.

470
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,880
The promise we made last time,

471
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,020
is it still valid?

472
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:47,580
No matter what may happen,

473
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,602
you won't run away from me.

474
00:52:50,602 --> 00:52:52,880
I promise.

475
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,820
I'll promise that

476
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,260
whatever happens, your mother won't be the one to come between us.

477
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,060
No.

478
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,880
The person who made that promise,

479
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,040
and the person who held the promise,

480
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,720
no longer exist.

481
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,580
Now it's my turn, right?

482
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,360
Woo Bin Sunbae.

483
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,000
Me?

484
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,780
If the F4 were women,

485
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,620
who would you want to get married to?

486
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,519
What?

487
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:57,220
I'm really curious. Who would it be?

488
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,340
No way. None of them. I'd never want to!

489
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,840
Self-centered, 4th dimensional*, and a cold-hearted womanizer.
 (T/N: meaning a person who is weird / in his own world)

490
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,280
Would you want me to spend my whole life with someone like that?

491
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,940
I'd rather be sent to a nunnery.

492
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,580
What's wrong?

493
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,880
- Self-centered egoist?
- 4th-dimensional?

494
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,380
Cold-hearted Casanova?

495
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,390
What would you do if you didn't have a choice but to choose one of us, huh?

496
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,320
Go away! Get away from me!

497
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,600
Don't come here!

498
00:54:57,692 --> 00:55:00,940
That's all, right? I'm leaving.

499
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,740
Hold on.

500
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,920
What now?

501
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,480
I want to play it, too.

502
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,220
What?

503
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:11,820
That truth or dare game.

504
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,892
I am going to ask just one question. Will you answer me?

505
00:55:17,892 --> 00:55:21,100
That game ended a while ago.

506
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,260
Love and friendship.

507
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,980
What would you choose if you had to choose one out of them?

508
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,080
Both.

509
00:55:39,788 --> 00:55:42,640
There is no such thing as "giving up" in my dictionary.

510
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,840
Go in and sleep.

511
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,880
Fool.

512
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,880
If you keep saying all the right things,

513
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,800
what am I supposed to do?

514
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:31,120
Noona, the ground's shaking.

515
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,380
I'm shaking too.

516
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,580
Is it an earthquake?

517
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,780
Where do you think we are, Japan?

518
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,160
Earthquake?!

519
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,180
Oh, you guys are still here. Hurry, pack your belongings and leave.

520
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,060
This morning, we've started to demolish this building.

521
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:27,040
Demolish? All of a sudden?

522
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,080
We're just following orders. We don't have any of the details.

523
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,860
So please pack your belongings.

524
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,240
We must do as ordered.

525
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,660
Who ordered?

526
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,920
We don't have that information.

527
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,400
Please hurry and pack your belongings.

528
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,100
You draw an engaged man to your house, and what?

529
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:56,040
You say you've done nothing wrong?

530
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,840
Noona, what do we do now?

531
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,200
It's ok. Don't worry.

532
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,380
It seems that father is mesmerized by this young lady, should I lend her to you?

533
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,780
Yi Jung sunbae.

534
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,000
Well done. See you tomorrow.

535
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,400
Please have a safe journey.

536
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,120
You're working diligently.

537
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,720
It's because I want to make something decent already.

538
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,180
Well then, I will leave first.

539
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,740
Goodbye.

540
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,260
What is that?

541
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,828
It's very unique.

542
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,150
I made it when I was little.

543
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,800
It even has some writing. It's pretty.

544
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,411
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

545
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:51,540
Teacher, can you lend this to me for a few days?

546
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,040
I've wanted to make something like this.

547
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,900
It's not hard. Would you like to try making one?

548
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,880
It is something very valuable to me, so return it to me in one piece.

549
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,520
Yes.

550
01:00:11,035 --> 01:00:12,467
It's pretty!

551
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:14,200
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

552
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,420
Take care.

553
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:39,440
You've put too much pressure on your wrist.

554
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:43,500
Yi Jung sunbae.

555
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,780
Noona, are you jealous?

556
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:11,140
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to eat a whole bunch of seafood.

557
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,140
So cheap.

558
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:17,240
You get to eat lots of delicious seafood all by yourself and get to sleep with mom and dad.

559
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,020
Lucky.

560
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,580
Maybe I should I go too.

561
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,380
No way!

562
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,400
Didn't you say you were going to Shinhwa Medical School after you graduate from Shinhwa High School?

563
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,780
How do you plan on doing that if you go?

564
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,840
Do you really think you'll be okay?

565
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,180
Don't worry. I'll take good care of mom and dad.

566
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,580
I'm going.

567
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,870
The train will be departing soon.

568
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:48,570
Passengers who are using the train service, please proceed...

569
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,240
Noona, don't just drink milk for breakfast. Eat some food too.

570
01:02:00,127 --> 01:02:01,840
Food.

571
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,640
It seems like Joon Pyo Hyungnim still likes you.

572
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:16,200
I said he still likes you.

573
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:25,190
I'm always on your side sister. Be strong!

574
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:26,880
Fighting!

575
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:56,130
♫ Shout to the world, "I love you..." ♫

576
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:00,070
♫ "...I love you, be my woman" ♫

577
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:03,740
♫ You are blinding. Always you're my star ♫

578
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,540
♫ I'll protect you ♫

579
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,850
♫ I can always be waiting for you ♫

580
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,400
♫ Towards the end of a tiring day ♫

581
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,200
Geum Jan Di.

582
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,190
That was cute.

583
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,475
Geum Jan Di.

584
01:03:23,475 --> 01:03:26,280
Sorry. Why isn't this working?

585
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,760
This is driving me crazy.

586
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,040
I really have to get going.

587
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,417
What did he say?

588
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:45,290
♫ On the sky I promise you ♫

589
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:49,400
♫ I'll bet my everything to protect you ♫

590
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,550
♫ Shout to the world, "I love you..." ♫

591
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,750
I was about to eat.

592
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:58,700
♫ "...I love you, be my woman" ♫

593
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,320
Can't I eat a little?
