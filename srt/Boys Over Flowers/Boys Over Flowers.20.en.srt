7
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,534
This...

8
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,962
Ohh. Isn't it pretty?

9
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:15,753
It's unique and doesn't look that difficult to make, so I want to give it a try.

10
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:17,939
Where did you get it?

11
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:21,304
Why?

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,401
Tell me! Where did you get this?!

13
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:28,667
From the teacher who teaches here.

14
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:48,511
To me that friend was

15
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:52,745
my kiln and potter's wheel.

16
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:57,289
I was afraid

17
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:01,742
that I would make her cry.

18
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:06,422
Like my father...

19
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:09,583
and my mother...

20
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:15,404
I didn't want her to end up crying because of me.

21
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,801
I ran away.

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,098
Impossible.

23
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,600
The call cannot be answered.

45
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,224
I told you not to get involved with a man like him.

46
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:36,708
Do you know how insulting that was for him?

47
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:41,030
I gave them money for their troubles. What is the problem?

48
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,903
Was it not enough?

49
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,597
This is the first time I've ever wanted something.

50
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:49,761
Can't you let me win just this once?

51
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:51,432
How?

52
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:55,515
How can that kind of man be what you want?

53
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,702
You are Shinhwa Group's heiress!

54
00:06:57,702 --> 00:07:02,717
Instead of meeting Korea's, no, Asia's best male prospects...

55
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:04,320
Get a hold of yourself!

56
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,239
To me, that person is the best,

57
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,342
because I love him.

58
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,763
Other men, no matter who they are, make no difference to me!

59
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:16,765
Pathetic girl.

60
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:22,752
Marrying a man for a love that will fade in a few years will not be an option.

61
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:23,829
Mom!

62
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:26,196
That's right! Because I am your mother.

63
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,900
Because you were born into the Shinhwa Group,

64
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,997
I cannot allow your foolish gamble at love.

65
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:36,436
You can do that in your next life.

66
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,869
Miss?

67
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:40,500
What should we do?! Are you all right, Miss?

68
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,620
Miss, are you okay?

69
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,650
What happened? Please wake up.

70
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,560
Try to help her up, hurry.

71
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:50,767
Hello?

72
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:53,715
The lady has fainted here!

73
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:56,327
If you're wondering where this is.

74
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:05,104
Are you awake?

75
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,427
What happened?

76
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,143
You were almost in big trouble!

77
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,176
You collapsed on the road.

78
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,688
But how did you...?

79
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,718
What would have happened if I had not called you at the right time?

80
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:19,533
Why were you being so foolish?

81
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:23,033
Didn't I tell you to call me if things got too hard for you?

82
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,947
Don't you consider us sisters anymore?

83
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:29,173
It's not that.

84
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,492
Did something bad happen?

85
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:36,621
Then, from now on, you have to listen to what I say.

86
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:52,252
From now on, Jan Di, you are my guest.

87
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:57,253
Since your parents aren't around, you cannot leave this house until things get better for you. Understand?

88
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:59,388
Unnie, but that is a little...

89
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:03,782
Regardless of Joon Pyo didn't we decide that you were going to treat me as if I were your real older sister?

90
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,902
Even so, the President...

91
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:11,144
There's no need to worry about my mother. She's out of the country for a while.

92
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,924
You don't have any more concerns do you?

93
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,533
So lot of nerve, though, and you...

94
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:23,589
Right! That's the way it ought to be!

95
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,400
But... I have a condition too...

96
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,558
Condition?

97
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:32,336
I don't like to accept things for free.

98
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:35,645
For sleeping and eating in this house,

99
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,674
please put me to work.

100
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,498
What?

101
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,537
I am curious about something.

102
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:58,008
About what?

103
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:01,179
What is your reason for being so nice to me?

104
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:05,870
You know, honestly, Goo Joon Pyo is already engaged.

105
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,788
If the President finds out that you're doing this...

106
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,643
Are you really that curious?

107
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:16,799
Finished! It's a gift!

108
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,452
From today onward, Geum Jan Di is the new maid.

109
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:48,444
She is like my sister, I want to give her all but she wants to work.

110
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:51,247
Everyone, please help her out.

111
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,710
Hello, I'm Geum Jan Di. Please take care of me.

112
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,964
There is no need for us to take care of you!

113
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:21,839
Grandma. Please take care of her.

114
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,625
If you have to ask that, it's better if she doesn't start.

115
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,461
Granny, go a little gentler on her.

116
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:33,568
No. There's no need! I will do my best!

117
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:35,778
Please treat me the same as you would the others.

118
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:38,163
Your best will not do.

119
00:12:38,163 --> 00:12:39,322
Perfect.

120
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:44,083
In this household perfection is a requirement.

121
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,783
Are you ready?

122
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,610
You are not a child. Answer the question! Say, "Yes! I understand!"

123
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,202
Confidently and clearly.

124
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:03,114
Yes... I understand!

125
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:07,465
I have to return to the U.S.

126
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:10,001
Will you be fine on your own?

127
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:12,550
Don't worry about me.

128
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,348
You! You new girl!

129
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:18,013
What do you think you're doing, chatting instead of getting to work?

130
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:20,012
Yes, Granny!

131
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,140
What do you mean, "Granny"?

132
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,002
How did I become "Grandma" to Miss Geum Jan Di?

133
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:28,254
Then... what should I call you?

134
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:32,298
This is a divine work place for you and me.

135
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:35,230
Call me, "Sunbae!"

136
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,513
Oh... Sunbae?

137
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:42,108
How long are you going to just stand there like an idiot?

138
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:45,103
If you're going to learn everything from the basics, every second and minute is precious!

139
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:47,570
Hurry up!

140
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:50,435
Yes!

141
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:10,070
In this house, a maid needs to meet all the needs of her master.

142
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,840
Work hard for the convenience of the master that you are serving.

143
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:16,771
There is a list of all these things.

144
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:20,076
Ironing a shirt in one minute is a given.

145
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:24,215
Being able to correctly dust expensive artworks.

146
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:29,706
Knowing how to organize all the wines.

147
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:33,568
Chambertin (wrong pronunciation).

148
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,706
Chambertin.

149
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:44,657
Now, we will memorize the menu.

150
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:50,012
Shrimp carpaccio with white truffle aioli.

151
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:56,146
Shrimp-tu carpa.

152
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,572
Skirt steak garnished with asparagus.

153
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:10,343
Aa... As-pa-ra-gam (asparagus).

154
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:15,424
Roast duck with bell pepper chutney.

155
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:24,410
Duck?

156
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:30,644
I am hungry! Give me food.

157
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:53,421
Sprinkled basil oil on le...

158
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:55,250
Lentil corn!

159
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,325
Lentil corn.

160
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,101
Oh my!

161
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:06,291
Grandma, you're still alive?

162
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,517
Yes. No matter how you may wish for it, it seems I cannot go.

163
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:13,643
No, no that's not what I meant.

164
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:15,959
It's because I haven't seen you for so long!

165
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,557
What happened to you?

166
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:20,366
Didn't you say you were going to run the housekeeping school or something?

167
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:26,617
The house was such a mess. I couldn't just sit and watch.

168
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:31,790
In the meantime, Butler Lee will be at the school on my behalf.

169
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:35,750
Why? Is there a problem?

170
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,710
N... No.

171
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,469
Who is she? Is she your student?

172
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:45,565
Where did you find such a stupid girl that can't even memorize the menu?

173
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:49,548
I took her on as my student because of an unavoidable situation.

174
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:50,973
I'll introduce her to you.

175
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:53,270
Come here.

176
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,530
Nice to meet you.

177
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:05,439
From now on, you will serve Master Joon Pyo here.

178
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,550
Please take care of me.

179
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,612
Ge... Geum Jan Di...

180
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:26,790
From today onwards, Geum Jan Di will be Master Joon Pyo's personal maid.

181
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,370
Per... personal maid?

182
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:41,944
Please. I will do anything else you want me to!

183
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:45,265
But what's this about Goo Joon Pyo's personal maid.

184
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,298
What do you mean, "Goo Joon Pyo"?

185
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:51,130
No one can call him like that in this house!

186
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,910
No matter what happens outside,

187
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,192
when you're working in this house, call him, "Master!"

188
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:02,090
Ah... Yes... Yes!

189
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,490
So as I was saying, please reconsider this position with 'Master'.

190
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,595
Grandm- Sunbaenim...

191
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,450
Please, I am begging you.

192
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:15,739
Have you already forgotten?

193
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:21,150
It's not something that can be decided just because you wish it.

194
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,841
I should not have come here.

195
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:42,890
Maybe it is still okay for me to leave right now.

196
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,270
I told you to come to me anytime you needed help.

197
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,010
Did you forget that we are unnie-dongsaeng?

198
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,157
Oh... Geum Jan Di.

199
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:03,495
Goo Joon Pyo's maid, Geum Jan Di, reply to me now.

200
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,270
Goo Joon Pyo?

201
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,130
Geum Jan Di. Report to my room immediately.

202
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,950
Over.

203
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,630
What?

204
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,890
This guy is really!

205
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,310
What are you doing right now?

206
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,170
It took you 3 minutes to get here.

207
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,360
Next time make it here in one.

208
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,770
What? You really...

209
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:02,598
I, Goo Joon Pyo, command my personal maid, Geum Jan Di, to make delicious ramen right away.

210
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,870
I don't want to!

211
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,530
You know I am holding back because of your sister.

212
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,230
I want my ramen in 10 minutes.

213
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,610
I'm hanging up.

214
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,230
Goo Joon Pyo. Do you really want to die?

215
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,670
Who do you think you are addressing so informally?

216
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,270
Yes, sir.

217
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:27,514
- What is this?
- It's the ramen...

218
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:29,716
that you wanted me to cook, Master.

219
00:21:29,716 --> 00:21:32,865
- There's no lid!
- What li...?

220
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:47,277
Satisfied?

221
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:50,933
- Where are you going?
- What do you want now... sir?

222
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:56,912
- What... what is it?
- I want you to sit there until I finish.

223
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,892
There is a button on the side, push it.

224
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:24,100
You!

225
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,530
I mean... Master.

226
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:30,332
What are you trying to do?

227
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:32,645
It's because the chair is so uncomfortable.

228
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:35,913
I'm just testing it. Just do as I say and sit.

229
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,750
♫ I keep smelling a familiar fragrance in the air ♫

230
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,100
♫ The breeze that brushed off you ♫

231
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:31,730
♫ Is passing by me now ♫

232
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,790
♫ In my heart ♫

233
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:40,150
♫ Perhaps there's only the sunlight that shines you ♫

234
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:45,420
♫ Even pain and wounds are embraced ♫

235
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:53,140
♫ Love you, I think of you now ♫

236
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,750
♫ I close my eyes again ♫

237
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:01,020
♫ I love you, if I could fill your two eyes ♫

238
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:07,070
♫ I love you, if you show me your smile ♫

239
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,740
♫ Even the starlight there ♫

240
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,080
♫ I will bring everything and give it to you ♫

241
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,430
♫ Love you, if I could convey these feelings of mine ♫

242
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:28,430
♫ Love you, if you teach me how that feels ♫

243
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,090
♫ I'll follow all of that ♫

244
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,040
♫ Love you Love you Love you ♫

245
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,000
♫ Forever ♫

246
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:53,491
Do you know what time it is?! How is it that you are still asleep?!

247
00:24:56,323 --> 00:25:00,144
Hurry over to master's room.

248
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:01,585
What?

249
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,692
This early?

250
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,940
What if all of us get fired?

251
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,070
Don't say that, seriously.

252
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,230
What should we do?

253
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:16,650
Get out!

254
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,481
If you try to wake me up one more time, I will fire you! Got it?

255
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,520
Don't cry.

256
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,430
It's okay.

257
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,920
I don't think he will fire us for real.

258
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:38,644
Sir Joon Pyo, don't you think it's time to wake up?

259
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,740
Didn't I tell you? I'll fire you if you try to wake me up again!

260
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,720
Do you want to die?

261
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:53,843
Goo Joon Pyo... Get up!

262
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:57,079
How many people have to risk their jobs just to wake you up?

263
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,738
- Get up!
- What the!

264
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:02,886
Geum Jan Di.

265
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:09,390
Okay! I got it, I'll get up! I'm getting up.

266
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,237
About firing you... I take it back.

267
00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:47,790
What? Thank you. Thank you.

268
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:50,333
Satisfied?

269
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,880
Thank you Geum Jan Di!

270
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,660
Is there anything that you need?

271
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:46,009
Yi Jung. How did you...

272
00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:52,312
I used to be the one hiding, so I never got to seek.

273
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:59,610
It's pretty hard.

274
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,396
Cha Eun Jae.

275
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,996
Don't you think you hid too well?

276
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:12,370
I was almost about to give up on the game.

277
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,255
Yi Jung...

278
00:28:39,624 --> 00:28:43,805
Why does nothing work for both of us?

279
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,039
What do you think is worse?

280
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:50,277
Working as a personal maid under your ex-boyfriend or

281
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:57,010
accidentally putting your crush and his first love together as soon as you gather up the courage to ask him out?

282
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,173
I think comparing the two situations is sad in itself.

283
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:06,919
Hello?

284
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,434
Jae Kyung unnie.

285
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:10,424
Jan Di! Did you move again?

286
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:13,628
Where did your house go? There's not even a trace of it left.

287
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:16,619
Oh yeah. Something came up.

288
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:19,550
So? Where did you go?

289
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,790
Let's have another housewarming party!

290
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,816
I'll buy you something good to eat!

291
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:28,934
Ga Eul! Let's play truth or dare like the last time, too? Doesn't that sound good?

292
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,520
Tell me, where?

293
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,250
There were some issues... So...

294
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,358
My house!

295
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:39,280
Jan Di is sharing my room with me right now,

296
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,925
so I don't think we can hang out like last time. That's why we haven't invited you.

297
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:43,996
We're sorry.

298
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:48,470
Oh, I see. I'm glad you're at least with Ga Eul.

299
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,217
You could have stayed with me, too.

300
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:54,700
Thank you for offering.

301
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,695
Oh yeah. Can you pack some porridge for me?

302
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:57,732
Porridge?

303
00:29:57,732 --> 00:30:02,369
Goo Joon Pyo is sick?

304
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,819
- I'm going to go visit him.
- Joon?

305
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:09,142
No, Goo Joon Pyo is not sick. He was fine this morn-

306
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:13,130
Jan Di. Isn't it time for you to go to the clinic?

307
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,670
You should go.

308
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,791
That's right. You're all done.

309
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:37,407
He's alright. Breathing's good.

310
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:40,472
Even though he has a fever, he's still healthy.

311
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,690
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

312
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,050
You should hold your mom's hand.

313
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,325
Goodbye.

314
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:05,970
Doctor.

315
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,150
Doctor...

316
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,550
Grandpa!

317
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,388
Grandpa... Grandpa... are you okay?

318
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:23,070
Ah, I'm all right.

319
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,670
I know my own disease.

320
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:31,510
There's nothing to be worried about.

321
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,605
You're not okay.

322
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:50,460
What would have happened if I hadn't been here? This happened last time, too.

323
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,430
Right.

324
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:56,222
You can't live by yourself like this.

325
00:31:56,222 --> 00:32:00,799
So you plan on putting me in a retirement home?

326
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,130
Yes.
You!!

327
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,250
Sunbae...

328
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,895
What are you doing here all of a sudden?

329
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,272
What is all this?

330
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:30,496
It's for moving in.

331
00:32:30,496 --> 00:32:34,161
Do you have a spare room?

332
00:32:39,382 --> 00:32:40,993
Come on, hurry!

333
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,278
Come on, hu-

334
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:45,168
Hold on a moment.

335
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,167
Come on, hurry!

336
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:57,371
Ah, I don't know what your motive is.

337
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,608
- Why don't I see my personal maid?
- Pardon?

338
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:16,866
Geum Ja...

339
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,626
My new personal maid.

340
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:24,570
Her master is eating and she doesn't even show her face?

341
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,776
New personal maid?

342
00:33:26,776 --> 00:33:29,550
Today is Saturday, sir.

343
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,327
So?

344
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:36,532
So?

345
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:41,076
When Mistress Joon Hee hired Geum...

346
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:50,928
Because of school and her part-time jobs,

347
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:56,560
she's only required to work during the 5 weekdays. So...

348
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,498
Only five days?

349
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:02,173
What kind of maid is that?

350
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,025
Sir, Mistress Jae Kyung is here.

351
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:07,974
- What?!
- Joon....

352
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,160
What...

353
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,670
Our little Joon... Does it hurt? Should I nurse you back to health?

354
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,710
Let's eat porridge.

355
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:22,439
Are you sick?

356
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:28,087
Here.

357
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,010
What are you doing Joon Pyo?

358
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,580
Your fiancée says to open.

359
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,360
Say "ah".

360
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:43,190
Good, you eat well.

361
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,126
Does it taste good?

362
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,047
Come and sit down.

363
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,820
Here.

364
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,835
Here is...

365
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,540
Alright.

366
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,988
This is your home now.

367
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:02,894
YOU!

368
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:06,124
What kind of person does this all of a sudden?

369
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:09,634
He and I need time to prepare our minds.

370
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:11,929
You've been doing it for 15 years.

371
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:14,161
Preparing your mind.

372
00:35:15,926 --> 00:35:18,110
Was it not enough?

373
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:25,781
Also if you don't listen to me, I might tell him all about it.

374
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:27,915
About what!?

375
00:35:27,915 --> 00:35:30,958
That you are sick.

376
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:35,865
Should I do that?

377
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:40,654
Look at you. Where did you learn all these bad things from?

378
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:48,442
I've been told that I have good skills in dealing.

379
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:51,886
Goodnight.

380
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:56,471
- Jan Di...
- Yes.

381
00:35:56,471 --> 00:36:00,554
Do you think he'll forgive me?

382
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:04,739
What are you so scared of? You're his grandfather.

383
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:08,892
If your grandson doesn't listen, just give him a good beating.

384
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,376
Goodnight.

385
00:36:51,063 --> 00:36:53,143
What do you think you are doing?

386
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:59,587
You and your grandpa needed a family.

387
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,521
All I did was help you guys find it.

388
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:05,375
- Geum Jan Di, I'm still...
- You're not ready for it?

389
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:11,028
Grandpa said the same thing.

390
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:17,411
For something like this, how much time do you need to prepare...?

391
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:22,448
Isn't that pointless?

392
00:37:23,128 --> 00:37:25,980
You said it before,

393
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,012
it's impossible to know somebody completely.

394
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:36,960
But you can at least know what kind of person he or she is.

395
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:44,471
The Ji Hoo I know,

396
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:48,993
still loves and misses his grandfather.

397
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:54,379
So, he's capable of forgiving him.

398
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:22,399
Geum Jan Di. Answer me. Geum Jan Di.

399
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,394
My personal maid!

400
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:26,590
Don't you think you're a little too absent just because you have the day off?

401
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,960
Are you still not in?

402
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:36,025
What?! I'm not supposed to be working right now.

403
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:38,050
Hurry here right now.

404
00:38:38,923 --> 00:38:42,910
I start on Monday at five o'clock. Call me then.

405
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:47,608
You can earn extra money for extra hours.

406
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:59,282
What? Do you want me to make ramen?

407
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:02,824
Huh? What is this?

408
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:04,696
Sit still here.

409
00:39:05,855 --> 00:39:07,114
What? What is this?

410
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:10,256
Hold on a minute and just sit still.

411
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,718
What is this?

412
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,248
It's starting.

413
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,450
[First Day of Midterms]

414
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:12,932
Leave that there too.

415
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,450
- You feel frustrated about having to study, right?
- No.

416
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,630
Even so, the elites are gathered here, so take pride in that.

417
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,830
Yes!

418
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,800
He's not here yet.

419
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,130
It's almost time.

420
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,400
I want to leave!

421
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,760
Let's show them the capabilities of our school.

422
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,696
Geum Jan Di

423
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:05,989
Goo Joon Pyo... There's a huge problem! A huge problem!

424
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:09,297
Jae Kyung unnie. She is walking up here right now.

425
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:10,868
What?

426
00:41:16,381 --> 00:41:18,831
What are we going to do? What are going to do now?

427
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:21,973
Why do we have to do anything? Just stay still.

428
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:23,588
It's better this way.

429
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:27,485
- This time is...
- Ah... over there!!

430
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,859
Hey! Where are you going?

431
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,947
What are you doing?

432
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:44,750
Why would you go in there?

433
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,935
Goo Joon Pyo. Close the door for me.

434
00:41:46,935 --> 00:41:49,370
I asked why you'd go in there?

435
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:56,880
Joon! Joon!

436
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,330
Where are you? I'm here.

437
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,766
So you were in here.

438
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:13,926
Hey Monkey. Don't you sleep?

439
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:16,161
What kind of woman comes to someone else's house in the middle of the night?

440
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,829
You're not "someone else." You're "someone I like."

441
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,343
What?

442
00:42:19,343 --> 00:42:21,120
Isn't it funny?

443
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,904
My dad always said the words of a popular song has its philosophy.

444
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:27,329
I didn't know what it meant.

445
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:30,146
But now I so understand it.

446
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:31,626
Maybe because I'm dating?

447
00:42:31,626 --> 00:42:33,694
What dating?

448
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:35,601
Anyway, why are you here?

449
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:37,130
To spend the night.

450
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,990
Night...

451
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:45,030
Let's watch this together.

452
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,935
I wanted to watch this, but I'm too scared to watch it alone.

453
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,990
Good, right? Let's go.

454
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,810
♫ I know I shouldn't feel this way ♫

455
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:29,300
♫ A lie... If I said it was a lie ♫

456
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,460

486
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:42,078
I remember you liked this when you were young.

487
00:46:42,078 --> 00:46:43,986
Let's eat!

488
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:46,585
I'm not hungry.

489
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:54,099
Then at least take this.

490
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:56,901
Jae Kyung... How did you...?

491
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:58,766
Jan Di... How could you do this?

492
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:01,579
Why did you lie to me? I thought you were my best friend.

493
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:04,020
I wanted to be with you for the rest of my life like sisters!

494
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,740
How could you do this to me?

495
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,960
Jae Kyung... That's not it.

496
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,008
I'm sorry... The truth is...

497
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:17,874
I don't want to hear excuses.

498
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:21,179
You lied to me, you hurt me more than you can imagine.

499
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:25,318
Please, listen to me.

500
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,336
Jan Di! What are you doing today?

501
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:51,828
I'm really sorry, I think I'm busy all day! I'm so busy I don't think I can do anything today.

502
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:55,121
Right now I'm on my way out.

503
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:59,168
Really? Okay, bye.

504
00:49:59,888 --> 00:50:01,668
Bye.

505
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:35,201
Did you two sleep well?

506
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:38,937
- What are you doing here?
- So early in the morning?

507
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:43,219
Ah, me? I came to go to work with you two!

508
00:50:49,403 --> 00:50:53,825
Well, since it's the three of us, let's take the car.

509
00:50:55,314 --> 00:50:58,909
Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go!

510
00:50:59,395 --> 00:51:01,306
Here, ma'am...

511
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:04,990
Be careful, it's hot.

512
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,100
Grandpa, here.

513
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,880
Can I take a look at your temperature?

514
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,820
Thank you.

515
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,464
Oh! It's normal temperature.

516
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:18,120
Here you go...

517
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,006
Grandma! Grandma!

518
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:29,477
I don't want to!

519
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:35,330
Mrs. Min.

520
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,350
Can you help me hold him for a while?

521
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:39,539
Oh, hold on a minute.

522
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,570
Let me.

523
00:51:53,472 --> 00:51:55,662
Sunbae! Sunbae!

524
00:51:55,662 --> 00:52:00,200
- Please give us some tea.
- We didn't drink tea either.

525
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,950
That's right, us too.

526
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,650
How did you get so handsome?

527
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,950
You can become a celebrity.

528
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,120
This is good.

529
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,640
I think I'll drink a cup too.

530
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,900
Can I get one?

531
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,370
Okay.

532
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:30,387
Yes, it's good.

533
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,018
You can exit this way.

534
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:54,202
Please wait a little bit.

535
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,960
He's so handsome.

536
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,470
That was lovely.

537
00:54:33,926 --> 00:54:36,819
It has been a while since I have been here.

538
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:42,824
Do you remember getting in trouble from playing hide and seek in here?

539
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:47,979
Of course. I had to clean for a week as punishment.

540
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:50,080
Right.

541
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,100
And you said you were cold so we tried to heat it up and we got in trouble again.

542
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,898
You were the one who told me you were cold.

543
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:01,490
No way! It was you!

544
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:05,343
No... was it me?

545
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:17,274
Your mother, is she well?

546
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:20,950
She's still the same.

547
00:55:21,582 --> 00:55:24,201
Do you want to know about my dad as well?

548
00:55:24,817 --> 00:55:27,290
What about you?

549
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,940
You have been well, right?

550
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:33,240
Are you curious?

551
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,774
Are you really curious?

552
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,658
Why did you do that?

553
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,650
Do what?

554
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:44,099
How could you do that all of a sudden?

555
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,503
Without a warning, how could you disappear like that?

556
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,594
Do you know how I felt?

557
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:54,500
I felt suffocated,

558
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,500
as though the air I breathed was all gone.

559
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:03,808
Can you imagine how I felt?

560
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,548
How could you have done that to me?

561
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:10,804
I wasn't the air.

562
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,203
What?

563
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:17,852
I... I wasn't your air... Yi Jung.

564
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:22,663
I was just a breeze that you mistook for air.

565
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:27,992
I thought of myself the same way, Yi Jung.

566
00:56:28,804 --> 00:56:35,655
I thought, if I wanted to, I could stay at your side forever.

567
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:40,240
What are you trying to say?

568
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,430
A breeze...

569
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,560
Once it passes by, it can't come back to the same place Yi Jung.

570
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,059
Why are you here, like this?

571
00:57:28,807 --> 00:57:31,000
It's you, Ga Eul.

572
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,900
I want to sleep.

573
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,730
Can we talk later?

574
00:57:39,343 --> 00:57:45,559
Sunbae, how could you act like you were so much better than me back then, when now you've become like this?

575
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:49,074
Can you shut up and leave?

576
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:53,113
No, if I shut up now,

577
00:57:53,113 --> 00:57:56,490
I'll probably have to watch you spend your life in this condition,

578
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:00,570
so I think I'll say a few more things.

579
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:04,198
Sunbae... You're a liar.

580
00:58:04,198 --> 00:58:06,388
You're immature.

581
00:58:06,388 --> 00:58:09,343
A pathetic coward.

582
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:10,311
What did you say?

583
00:58:10,311 --> 00:58:13,815
You said you pretended because you didn't want to hurt her, right?

584
00:58:13,815 --> 00:58:19,444
No, it was you, sunbae, who didn't want to get hurt.

585
00:58:19,444 --> 00:58:22,832
You thought that she'd see you for what you are and that she'd run away.

586
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,303
- Chu Ga Eul.
- I know.

587
00:58:25,303 --> 00:58:31,843
Your cool and collected self is just a mask.

588
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:37,417
But the Yi Jung that I like... He's afraid of love.

589
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:41,674
He's afraid of people leaving, just like a child.

590
00:59:10,306 --> 00:59:16,652
Children, in front of what they really want, they don't hesitate.

591
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:22,587
Because if they lose it, they know they'll start crying.

592
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:36,210
[Meeting]

593
00:59:47,047 --> 00:59:49,397
Thank you for today.

594
00:59:50,082 --> 00:59:54,146
You got to do more things for the first time because of me again, right?

595
00:59:54,146 --> 00:59:56,106
Get in. I'll take you home.

596
00:59:56,106 --> 00:59:58,831
No. I can go alone.

597
01:00:18,272 --> 01:00:21,010
Aigoo, it must be heavy.

598
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,939
Doctor, let's go.

599
01:00:25,939 --> 01:00:30,662
Work time is over so I'm now "grandpa"?

600
01:00:30,662 --> 01:00:33,714
Drive home safely, Grandpa.

601
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:35,990
- Put on your seatbelt!
- Ok.

602
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,720
Alright.

603
01:00:50,116 --> 01:00:52,739
Drive safely!

604
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,032
Drive safely!!

605
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,155
Sir.

606
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:40,866
Master!

607
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:01,119
Sir! It is time to wake up, Sir!

608
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,401
You should wake up now.

609
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:05,339
Sir.

610
01:02:08,217 --> 01:02:09,970
Sir.. SIR!!!

611
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,230
You.

612
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,710
You... What are you...?

613
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,404
Five minutes.

614
01:02:15,404 --> 01:02:19,035
Let me stay like this for five minutes, then I'll get up.

615
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:26,110
Even when I'm holding you like this,

616
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,966
I can't believe you're really here.

617
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,419
Joon... I'm here!

618
01:02:39,419 --> 01:02:41,323
Let's...

619
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:59,980
♫ Although I ask it to stop, to stop wherever it is ♫

620
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:04,420
♫ My heart keeps going to you ♫

621
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:09,000
♫ You don't even listen, or give in ♫

622
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,480
♫ Why is my love like this? ♫

623
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,440
How do I look?

624
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:18,630
I can't let go of Jan Di.

625
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,700
You're not asking me to take you and run from the wedding tomorrow,

626
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,460
right?

627
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,960
Goo Joon Pyo. I'm asking, what are you prepared for?

628
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,480
- How much should I be prepared?
- Everything.

629
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:36,380
I'll pay you back for the heartache.

630
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,660
Please forgive me.

631
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,840
- Break my arm for me.
- What?

632
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,960
Joon Pyo.

633
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,570
If this is the only way, you should just go.

634
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:50,270
We will become a married couple right here tomorrow.

635
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:54,320
No matter what happened in the past, from now on,

636
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,350
we will promise to love only each other.

637
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:03,320
♫ Just one line, "I love you" just that line ♫
