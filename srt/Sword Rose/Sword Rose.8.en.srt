3
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,510
He's dead.

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,790
He's dead?

5
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,430
Did you kill him?

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,080
It wasn't me.

7
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,870
I would never kill anyone.

8
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:51,000
If you didn't do it,
why would we be questioning you?

9
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,822
Do you think we would bring you in
without evidence?

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,960
Is this

11
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,430
your car?

12
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,510
Yes.

13
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,880
Where is it now?

14
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,230
I was just about to report on this.

15
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,480
My car was stolen.

16
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,950
We found your car
near Zhao Dafeng's body.

17
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,880
It was parked right next to his.

18
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,960
When was the last time

19
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,230
you saw Zhao Dafeng?

20
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,550
Last time?

21
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,950
How many days have I been here?

22
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,360
Is it

23
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,830
the fifth or sixth day?

24
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,266
Anyway, it's the night
before I came here.

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,760
We were playing cards.

26
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,360
After that?

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,177
After that, we all went home.

28
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,590
When you got home,

29
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,244
(Knife)
did you happen to see this knife?

30
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,760
That's not mine.

31
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,750
Are you sure it's not yours?

32
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,680
Yes.

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,950
It has your DNA on it

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,830
and Zhao Dafeng's.

35
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,470
We tested it,

36
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,770
and the lab report is right here.

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,760
Do you want to see it?

38
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,711
You two officers
really don't mess around.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,480
If you have that much evidence,

40
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,270
why waste time talking?

41
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,240
Just take me out and shoot me already.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,666
Watch your mouth.

43
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:34,310
We're trying to be nice,

44
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,400
and that's how you respond?

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,133
You don't get to decide your punishment.

46
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:38,111
Neither do we.

47
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,933
That's up to the prosecutor
and the court.

48
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:43,777
Do you even understand
what is happening?

49
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,680
The evidence clearly shows
you killed Zhao Dafeng.

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,110
You can't talk your way out of this.

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,270
Murder carries the death penalty.

52
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,240
We're here to give you the opportunity

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,920
to share some information,

54
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,644
and perhaps you'll receive
a more lenient sentence.

55
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,760
Got it?

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
Got it.

57
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,950
Zhao Dafeng once stole a girl from me.

58
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,422
My handler was furious and wanted
to make an example out of me,

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,510
so I asked Zhao to meet and talk.

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Feng, I'm here.

61
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,230
There you are.

62
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,990
Let's talk.

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,600
You're not getting

64
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,830
the girl.

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,520
Seriously?

66
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,350
In that case,

67
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,888
one of us isn't walking away alive.

68
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,870
What did you just say?

69
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,560
Repeat that.

70
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:01,950
I said if you can't give the girl back,

71
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,320
one of us has to die.

72
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,150
What a temper.

73
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,070
Darn right.

74
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,040
Serious, huh?

75
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,960
You're serious, huh?

76
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,000
One of us dies,

77
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,480
huh?

78
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:21,310
You may not care about your life,
but I still value mine.

79
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,310
Got it?

80
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,240
Come on, hit me.

81
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,390
Where's your temper?

82
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,390
Acting real tough, huh?

83
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,030
You even brought a knife.

84
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:34,380
What, are you going to stab me?

85
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:38,600
Would you even dare to stab me?

86
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,200
If you don't stab me right now,

87
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,350
I'll kill you.

88
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
Do it.

89
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,310
Do it!

90
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,110
Still putting up an act...

91
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,911
I'm calling the cops.

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
You little punk, I'm calling the police.

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
The police...

94
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,950
Do you have a handler?

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,950
My handler...

96
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,990
is Skinner.

97
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,030
It's Skinner.

98
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,150
He runs the supply around here.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
I've met him a few times.

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,644
There's something you'll notice.

101
00:06:58,244 --> 00:06:59,440
He loves salted duck eggs.

102
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,320
Where is he now?

103
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,400
I don't know.

104
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,000
How do you guys usually keep in touch?

105
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,120
He's the one who usually calls me.

106
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,390
What is his number?

107
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,910
I don't remember.

108
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,640
It's in my phone.

109
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,440
You can check,

110
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,590
but it won't help.

111
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,630
Guys like them change numbers
all the time.

112
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,190
Where are Zheng Weiwei and the girls

113
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,110
you trafficked?

114
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,390
I handed them off to Skinner.

115
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,200
I left after taking the money.

116
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,760
So if you want answers, talk to him.

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,950
After all this,

118
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:51,666
can I get a reduced sentence?

119
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,870
Skinner,

120
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,710
there's a crackdown going on.

121
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,760
Tell the guys to keep their heads down.

122
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,780
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

123
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:22,870
Who's looking for me?

124
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,790
She's inside.

125
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,244
You still want fried chicken
like last time?

126
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Are you done eating?

127
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,640
Yes.

128
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,880
Here.

129
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,030
So, can you tell me

130
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,190
why you left the welfare home,

131
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,710
and came looking for me?

132
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,830
I don't like it there.

133
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,590
Why not?

134
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:38,440
Aren't there a lot of kids to play with?

135
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,760
Did they pick on you?

136
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,333
They wouldn't dare bully me.

137
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,680
I only think

138
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,160
they're too childish

139
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,430
and silly.

140
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,520
We're all kids
who were abandoned by our parents.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,960
Yet, they're still laughing like fools
every day.

142
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,950
You see,

143
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,990
there are things in life we can choose

144
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,200
and cannot choose.

145
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,990
Those kids in the welfare home,
for instance,

146
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,200
all went through tragedies.

147
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,030
But that doesn't mean

148
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,680
they can't have a happy childhood.

149
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,510
It also doesn't mean

150
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,110
they won't have a good life.

151
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,400
What really matters

152
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,444
is how you choose to face it.

153
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,630
What happened in the past

154
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,720
has already happened.

155
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,080
No use dwelling on it.

156
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,800
But what comes next?

157
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,830
That's all up to you.

158
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,800
When you grow up, you'll understand.

159
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,470
Life comes

160
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,400
with both joy

161
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,911
and moments of disappointment too.

162
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,950
That's what makes life whole.

163
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,070
Do you understand?

164
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,630
Who told you all that?

165
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,160
No one

166
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,110
really tells you about that.

167
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:23,950
You have to figure it out for yourself.

168
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
Enough of that.

169
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,066
If you are done eating, I'll clean up.

170
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,040
Go wash your hands.

171
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,200
Later, I'll send you back
to the welfare home.

172
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:38,470
I want to go to the amusement park.

173
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,520
Everyone says it's fun.

174
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,790
If you behave.

175
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,070
Let's go.

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

177
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,430
Yan Lei is calling.

178
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,790
Hello, Director.

179
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,070
Director,

180
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,280
I have a bad signal here.

181
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:16,030
You told me to keep an eye on Mo Lin.

182
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,355
This afternoon, he ran off
into the mountains with a girl.

183
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,600
What do you mean?

184
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,520
Be clear.

185
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,320
A bunch of guys came
to Mo Lin's place looking for the girl.

186
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,679
Right after that, Mo Lin took her
and slipped out the back.

187
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,970
I already alerted the local police.

188
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:28,360
They are preparing a mountain search.

189
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,590
Why are they chasing the girl?

190
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,080
That's not the point right now.

191
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,260
We're pulling a night shift.
Let's head to Pengcang Town.

192
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,490
Okay, I'm coming with you guys.

193
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,320
Be careful out there!

194
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,710
Watch your step.

195
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,180
(Police)
You're here.

196
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,120
Here's the situation.

197
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
Mo Lin took a girl

198
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
and ran into the woods.

199
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,710
This is Chief Chen.

200
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,270
- Director Deng.
- Hi.

201
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,670
He suspects it could get dangerous,

202
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,670
so he has already sent in
a rescue team to assist.

203
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,190
Master.

204
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:20,422
How's the area set up?

205
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:21,280
Let's sync up.

206
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,360
Okay.

207
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,320
Officers,

208
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,150
it's the rainy season

209
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,110
in Pengcang now.

210
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,555
It's also mushroom-picking season.

211
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,750
The woods are damp,

212
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,880
cold, and slippery.

213
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,110
The river's water level is higher,

214
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,630
so ordinary people can't get across.

215
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,560
We've already blocked off
both ends of the bridge.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,950
They can only be hiding
by the stream near the village.

217
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,630
That narrows our search area.

218
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,710
The rescue team consists
of fifteen members,

219
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,866
in addition to thirty personnel
from our station.

220
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,870
We've covered every possible spot

221
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,830
they could reach.

222
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,320
The weather in the mountains
is unpredictable.

223
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,680
We need to find them fast.

224
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,480
What about Mr. Mo?

225
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,750
Did he run off with them?

226
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,080
No.

227
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,350
He's still playing dumb to cover
for Mo Lin.

228
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,480
But we have him under control.

229
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,511
We have someone watching him
at the supermarket.

230
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,670
Okay.

231
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,870
Here's the plan.

232
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,910
Mr. Yin, talk to Mr. Mo
and try to get through him.

233
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,333
Don't come into the forest with us.

234
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,710
Are you saying I'll slow you down?

235
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,560
Fine, I'll go talk to him.

236
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,720
Master, Mr. Mo is tight-lipped.

237
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,111
Let's go into the forest together.

238
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,333
Jiajia, stay with Mr. Yin.

239
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,710
Got it.

240
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,360
Song,

241
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,960
come here.

242
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,760
You go with the Director's team.
Be careful.

243
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,470
Yes, Sir.

244
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,720
Chang Rui,

245
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,800
stay close to Director Deng.

246
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
So,

247
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,511
what about this area?

248
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,160
That area...

249
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,830
Let's take a break.

250
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:10,670
There are still no leads.

251
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,720
That's right.

252
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,640
That's him.

253
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,680
A kid barely twenty.

254
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:28,920
I see him in the woods all the time,

255
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,920
but I have never seen the girl before.

256
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:34,390
- Let's keep walking.
- This way.

257
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,577
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

258
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,430
Wait.

259
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,955
It looks like someone
who rarely comes to the forest was here.

260
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:58,670
What makes you say that?

261
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,160
Anyone who knows this area

262
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:02,666
wouldn't bring fire into the woods.

263
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:04,630
And it wasn't just one person.

264
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,280
I have a theory.

265
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,280
You mentioned a group
that's been after Mo Lin.

266
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,960
They've shown up
at his place several times,

267
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,511
and all have been acting aggressively.

268
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,950
If the girl really escaped
during the transit,

269
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:23,955
then they are likely Skinner's men
who are chasing her.

270
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:25,266
That means the ones after her

271
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,377
and the ones chasing Mo Lin

272
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:27,444
might be the same group.

273
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's go take a look ahead.

274
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,360
Notify Chief Chen.

275
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,280
Yes, Madam.

276
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,100
(Mo's Grocery)

277
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,630
(We hope every missing child)

278
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,750
(can return home soon.)

279
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,080
(We also hope
every family can be whole again.)

280
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,220
(Mo's Grocery)

281
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:16,790
Do you have anything to drink?

282
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,622
(Linshan Police Warn of Trafficking)
(May trafficking come to an end.)

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Help yourself.

284
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,550
(This requires a joint effort)

285
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,490
(between the police
and all sectors of society...)

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,511
Why did you put your drinks so far in?

287
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,430
You've seen this girl more
than once, right?

288
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,110
You know why we're here.

289
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,520
There's no point hiding.

290
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,030
I suggest you tell us

291
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,760
everything you know.

292
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:54,870
Conditions in the mountains
aren't great.

293
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,000
We'll bring them food and water,

294
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,000
so they won't suffer needlessly.

295
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,990
Honestly,

296
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,600
they weren't hiding from you
in the first place.

297
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,220
Then, who were they hiding from?

298
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,510
San Laizi.

299
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,080
That thug from before.

300
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,560
San Laizi?

301
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,270
How many of them?

302
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,440
Four.

303
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,350
All armed with knives

304
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,270
and very aggressive.

305
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,350
Why are they after Mo Lin?

306
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,030
Because...

307
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,880
Because...

308
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,880
They just left.

309
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,180
It's the police. Let's get out of here.

310
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,190
They're over there.

311
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,880
Stop right there!

312
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,320
Stay there!

313
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,750
Stop!

314
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,120
Stop right there!

315
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,190
Stop!

316
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,400
Stay still!

317
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,990
Stop moving!

318
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:03,880
Don't come any closer!

319
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,800
Put your weapon down!

320
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,120
Stay still.

321
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,240
Mo Lin,

322
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,880
don't be scared.

323
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,800
We've met before.

324
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,920
We're the police.

325
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,510
The three suspects chasing you

326
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,480
have been arrested.

327
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,590
Lianqiao,

328
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,510
I've met them.

329
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,430
They're the police.

330
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,230
We're safe now.

331
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,090
Since you know we're the police,
why are you hiding from us?

332
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,240
I wasn't trying to hide from you.

333
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,150
It's just that...

334
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,260
(Police)

335
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,480
Do you know these two girls?

336
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,720
Okay, get down.

337
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,470
Faster!

338
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,550
Get down!

339
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,200
One by one!

340
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,120
Get out of the car!

341
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,800
Move it!

342
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,840
Go!

343
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,840
Where are they?

344
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,790
Don't worry.

345
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,720
They are safe now.

346
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,590
We have rescued them.

347
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,630
You're safe now too.

348
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,520
Can you tell me

349
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,110
how you ended up with Mo Lin?

350
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,670
Is Mo Lin one of them?

351
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,880
No, he's not.

352
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,440
Mo Lin

353
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,240
is a good person.

354
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,960
He saved me.

355
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
Please believe me, Officer.

356
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,670
He's really not a bad person.

357
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,470
I know.

358
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,920
Why did you lie?

359
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,950
I did not lie.

360
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,560
Since you're her friend,

361
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:27,840
do you know her real name?

362
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:29,480
Do you know where her home is?

363
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,470
She has no home.

364
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,430
You're from Mulang Town.

365
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,590
Your real name is He Xiaoying.

366
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,800
Your father's name is He Dashan.

367
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,160
No, no.

368
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,320
I'm not He Xiaoying.

369
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,110
That's not my home.

370
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,990
I am not He Xiaoying.

371
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,710
Lianqiao,

372
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,733
your father has been searching for you.

373
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,760
Why are you afraid to go back?

374
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,800
No, I don't want to go back.

375
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,960
That's not my home.

376
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,040
Please, I'm begging you.

377
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,520
Don't send me back.

378
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,720
Please.

379
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,640
Okay, calm down.

380
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,800
Then can you tell me

381
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,760
what happened

382
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,000
that makes you not want to go home?

383
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,355
Do you fear your father that much?

384
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,920
Stand there.

385
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,390
I told you to stand there!

386
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,800
You didn't come home to cook
after school.

387
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,590
You went off to be a waitress again,
didn't you?

388
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,630
I work right after school.

389
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,590
I only make thirty yuan a day.

390
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:42,750
I need to pay tuition,

391
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,733
cover household expenses,

392
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:44,755
and still buy your drinks!

393
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,480
I raised you!

394
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,044
What's wrong with buying me drinks?

395
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,711
Besides, do you think
that a waitress's job pays enough?

396
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:52,333
Then why don't you go earn
some money?

397
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,590
You stopped farming
and have rented out the land.

398
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,070
I do all the chores.

399
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,750
All you do is drink and gossip.

400
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,870
What else can you do?

401
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,830
Farm?

402
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,280
Farming doesn't make money.

403
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,240
Now,

404
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,240
this is what I call making money.

405
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,470
Did you gamble again?

406
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,390
No, you made this money.

407
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,840
Me?

408
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,577
Did my mom send me more money again?

409
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,190
What lies did you tell her this time?

410
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,679
What trouble did you claim I was in
to make her send that much?

411
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,666
Other than lying to my mom,
who else can you fool?

412
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:36,960
Don't bring up that woman!

413
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:38,133
Since she left me,

414
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,920
has she ever cared
whether I lived or died?

415
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,790
And you?

416
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,044
Do you think I don't know

417
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:44,266
you always hang around
with Madam Dong every day?

418
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,320
If not

419
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,440
for the thirty thousand yuan,

420
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,577
I would've smashed a bottle
over your head already!

421
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,040
Try going to school again tomorrow!

422
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,900
(Remuneration for Services)

423
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,700
(He Xiaoying)

424
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,190
What are you doing?

425
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,050
You useless wench!

426
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,070
I'll beat you to death!

427
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,880
Give me that!

428
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
Tear up the contract, huh? Listen here!

429
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,750
Even if you tore it,

430
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,800
I'm not paying them back a cent!

431
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,830
I ran away twice.

432
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,000
Both times, the police said

433
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,590
my dad was my legal guardian

434
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,590
and made me go back to him.

435
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,040
He acted all nice

436
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,150
in front of them.

437
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,030
But as soon as they left,

438
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,320
he turned into someone else.

439
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,590
I'm sure he'll try to sell me again.

440
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,560
Please, I'm begging you.

441
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,310
Please,

442
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,590
don't send me back.

443
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,070
Don't send me back.

444
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,190
Please.

445
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,430
Please.

446
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,910
Don't be afraid.

447
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,560
We won't send you back.

448
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,320
We won't let anyone hurt you.

449
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,870
Even if that's your father.

450
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,120
Thank you.

451
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,120
Thank you so much.

452
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:24,910
She has been through enough.

453
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,880
I can protect her.

454
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,800
How?

455
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:31,110
By hiding her in a cabin deep
in the mountains?

456
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:32,640
Is that your idea of protection?

457
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,240
What else did she tell you?

458
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,320
She ran away from home.

459
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,590
She wanted to find her mom,

460
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,350
but her mom's phone wasn't reachable.

461
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,640
So

462
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,870
she tried to work while saving money.

463
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:56,560
That's when she ran into those people.

464
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,230
At first...

465
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,830
I thought they were recruiting.

466
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,230
I had no idea

467
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,560
they would drug me.

468
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,270
Then,

469
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,840
when I woke up,

470
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,590
I was locked

471
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,760
in a wooden cabin.

472
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,390
Come here!

473
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,510
Later,

474
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,030
while they were transferring

475
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,240
some of us...

476
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,340
I took the chance to escape

477
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:41,644
when they weren't paying attention.

478
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,320
Hey, she's getting away!

479
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,710
Stop right there!

480
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,533
They chased me the whole night.

481
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,510
Skinner,

482
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,950
we lost her.

483
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,430
Keep looking.

484
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,840
She's there!

485
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,150
Skinner! Over here!

486
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,933
When I made it halfway up the mountain,

487
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,320
I saw San Laizi with two other men.

488
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,480
They were chasing Lianqiao.

489
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,880
Stop right there!

490
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,400
Stop!

491
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,710
Where did she go?

492
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,030
Skinner.

493
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:06,666
We'll definitely get her.

494
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,120
Search there.

495
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,470
San Laizi

496
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,955
is a well-known troublemaker
in our town.

497
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,200
He's good at sneaky stuff
like stealing and cheating.

498
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,320
I don't know the other two.

499
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,244
Why didn't you call the police?

500
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,866
I was scared
San Laizi would take revenge.

501
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,430
If he did,

502
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,800
my family would have no peace.

503
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,920
So

504
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,230
I...

505
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,400
I hid Lianqiao

506
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,840
in the mountains.

507
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,030
Dad!

508
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,430
Mo Lin?

509
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,870
Who is this girl?

510
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,350
I am not sure

511
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,710
why San Laizi

512
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,280
was chasing her down.

513
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Good thing I saved her.

514
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,577
She said she was abducted
from Mulang Town.

515
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,670
Mulang Town?

516
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,550
In any case,

517
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,830
we can't let them take her away.

518
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,430
We should report this.

519
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,720
Please, Mister.

520
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,520
Please help me.

521
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,310
Help me.

522
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,230
How about this?

523
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,760
Take her over that ridge

524
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:14,022
to your second uncle's place.

525
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,160
Call the police from there

526
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,311
and hand her over safely.

527
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,270
Go now.

528
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,880
Come with me.

529
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,800
Thank you.

530
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,510
If it weren't for Mo Lin

531
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,680
and Mr. Mo,

532
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,000
I would've been taken back again.

533
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,960
Officer,

534
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,920
please believe me.

535
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,310
Mo Lin is really a good person.

536
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,320
He saved me.

537
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,400
Okay,

538
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,270
I believe you.

539
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,680
We would never accuse a good person.

540
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,600
All right.

541
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,320
You might need to stay here for now.

542
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,240
I may need your help again later.

543
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,360
Can you do that?

544
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,670
Yes.

545
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,470
Where's Mo Lin?

546
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,950
Don't worry.

547
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,150
He will be fine.

548
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:46,555
Have some hot water.

549
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,510
It'll warm you up.

550
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,740
(Interrogation Room)

551
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:06,320
He hasn't confessed anything yet?

552
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,360
Not yet, sir.

553
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,560
You'll let me out

554
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,800
in a few days anyway.

555
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,800
I won't say a word.

556
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,380
So stop wasting your time.

557
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:21,866
Has he written out
the full account of the crime?

558
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:22,750
Yes.

559
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,270
Okay.

560
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,190
Then have him sign it.

561
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,710
Sign what?

562
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,150
I didn't even confess anything!

563
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,270
You've already written the entire crime

564
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,190
in your statement.

565
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,550
Do you really think we can't convict you

566
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,830
if you say nothing?

567
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:43,560
Everything is written in there.

568
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,880
Woman trafficking,

569
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,666
kidnapping, and assaulting
an officer with a weapon.

570
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,800
These are facts.

571
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,666
We don't need your confession.

572
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:53,760
Once you sign this, we'll send you
to the detention center.

573
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,349
This statement goes straight
to the Public Prosecutor's Office.

574
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,090
After that,
it's in the hands of the court.

575
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,110
With what we have,

576
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,080
the best case is five to eight years.

577
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,640
Worst case,

578
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,977
it could be a life sentence.

579
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:08,990
Stop wasting time. Just sign it.

580
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,270
Wait, Officer.

581
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,755
Why a life sentence all of a sudden?

582
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:13,950
Because you didn't say anything.

583
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,311
Wait, you didn't ask me anything.

584
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,110
Ask me.

585
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,888
I'll answer.

586
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:19,270
Didn't they say coming clean
could get me a lighter sentence?

587
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,070
Officer.

588
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,990
Just ask me.

589
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,760
So now you're ready to talk?

590
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,120
I...

591
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,488
I'm working under a handler.

592
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:27,511
Just ask me anything.
I'll tell you everything.

593
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,520
Who's your handler?

594
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,000
He's someone from the underworld.

595
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,000
I haven't known him long.

596
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,720
We call him Skinner.

597
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,630
It seems he's obsessed
with salted duck eggs.

598
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,880
Move it!

599
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,960
Skinner,

600
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,160
this girl's too stubborn.

601
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,130
It has been a whole night.

602
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:04,733
She wouldn't let the customer touch her
and made the customer mad.

603
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,200
That's a naughty girl.

604
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,320
Teach her a lesson.

605
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,920
All right, enough.

606
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,190
It would be a shame to ruin

607
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,920
that pretty face.

608
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,630
Look at me.

609
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,550
Look at me.

610
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,670
Listen.

611
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,440
If you listen to me from now on,

612
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,840
I promise

613
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,590
no one will ever dare lay a hand

614
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,200
on you again.

615
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,240
Okay?

616
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,230
You scumbags!

617
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,750
You'll get what's coming to you!

618
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,150
You can have her.

619
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,320
Thank you, Skinner.

620
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,280
Get up.

621
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,190
No!

622
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,540
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

623
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,470
Here's your dish.

624
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,230
Here's your food. Beef noodles, right?

625
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,960
If you like it spicy,

626
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
you can try

627
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,440
our house-made chili.

628
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,790
You can add more if you want.

629
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,880
Okay, thank you.

630
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,400
Yanyan?

631
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,590
Come here quickly.

632
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,920
Madam.

633
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,150
Take a seat.

634
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,320
Okay.

635
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,080
You're free today?

636
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,710
I saw on TV

637
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,270
that you've solved
a few big cases lately.

638
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,590
That's great.

639
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,280
How about

640
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,360
some noodles?

641
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:13,840
No need to trouble you.

642
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,760
It's no trouble.

643
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,400
Vegetarian rice noodles

644
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,320
with extra chili?

645
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,510
Coming right up.

646
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,200
Here you go.

647
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,840
See

648
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,630
if it still tastes like the old days.

649
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,840
It tastes exactly like
what I had when I was a kid.

650
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Really?

651
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,230
Some of the ingredients

652
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,550
in that broth

653
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,920
are really hard to find now.

654
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,755
Whenever I come across them, I stock up.

655
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,190
I have to preserve this flavor.

656
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,310
Ranran used to love these noodles too,

657
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,190
but she was way pickier than you.

658
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,190
No cilantro, no green onions,
and no five-spice powder.

659
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,110
I don't even know
what she was tasting at that point.

660
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,070
Madam.

661
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,320
To be honest,

662
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,960
I've come here many times
over the years,

663
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,670
but I always stood outside.

664
00:37:46,688 --> 00:37:48,488
I didn't have the courage to come in.

665
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,110
I...

666
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,190
I've had so many nightmares.

667
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,590
In them,

668
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,150
I've imagined
so many different possibilities.

669
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,400
What if I hadn't asked
Lin Ran to go out with me that day?

670
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,630
If I hadn't taken her out,

671
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,630
she wouldn't have been kidnapped.

672
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,280
Yanyan...

673
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,200
What if

674
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,840
I had held on tighter
to that trafficker's leg?

675
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,880
If I had,

676
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,920
he wouldn't have taken Ranran.

677
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,977
If only he did take her...

678
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:17,400
Yanyan.

679
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,320
I could have...

680
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,710
It's not your fault.

681
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,040
You were just a child back then.

682
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,080
What could you even do?

683
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,400
Yes, I admit.

684
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,400
After Ranran was kidnapped,

685
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,710
my whole family

686
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,950
fell apart.

687
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,960
I felt hopeless.

688
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,550
But...

689
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,590
Yanyan,

690
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,790
I never blamed you.

691
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,920
Yanyan,

692
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,920
you went

693
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,880
to the Public Security University

694
00:39:07,488 --> 00:39:09,066
to join the Anti-abduction Office.

695
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Did you do

696
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,310
all of this

697
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,760
(Missing Person)

698
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,590
because of Ranran?

699
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,360
Madam,

700
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,630
I will find her.

701
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,680
Thank you.

702
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,150
Madam,

703
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,990
can I have the bill?

704
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,030
So...

705
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,070
Yanyan,

706
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,560
whenever you're free,

707
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,880
come here.

708
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:50,520
I'll make you vegetarian noodles.

709
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,030
Okay.

710
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,240
Eat up.

711
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,150
Okay.

712
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,590
Please come again.

713
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,780
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

714
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,880
Jiajia,

715
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,990
can you check

716
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,960
who was in charge of this case before?

717
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,990
Rui.

718
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,280
Where is he?

719
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,460
I haven't seen him lately,
even with all the overtime.

720
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,710
It's not work-related.

721
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,840
Is he dating someone?

722
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,400
Guess.

723
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,070
No way.

724
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,480
Who is she?

725
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,110
It's not that.

726
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,590
He took Luoluo out to have some fun.

727
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,720
Luoluo?

728
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:49,710
The little girl we sent
to the welfare home?

729
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,630
Yeah.

730
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,710
Didn't we find her sister earlier?

731
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,030
The adoptive parents didn't want
to adopt Luoluo.

732
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,190
She was really upset after that.

733
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,670
Since then,

734
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,750
he has been taking her out a lot.

735
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,440
And he doesn't want anyone to know.

736
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,080
That's so him.

737
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:07,911
Tough on the outside,
soft on the inside.

738
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:10,550
Next time he goes out,
he should bring me too.

739
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,666
Here. Which one do you want?

740
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:55,470
This one.

741
00:41:59,022 --> 00:42:00,480
So, do you like the amusement park?

742
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,550
Yes.

743
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,070
What do you want to do next?

744
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,360
Roller-coaster.

745
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,520
No, you're too little

746
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,150
for that one.

747
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,840
Then you go ride it.

748
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,760
I'll watch.

749
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,590
Me?

750
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,520
Nah, it's boring.

751
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,670
You're scared, aren't you?

752
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,920
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

753
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,590
