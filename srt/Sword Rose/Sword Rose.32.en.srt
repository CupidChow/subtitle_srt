=Episode 32=

3
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,500
(Wu: I've failed. Farewell, Sir.)

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,300
(Delete)

00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,820
(Delete message? Confirm)

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,900
(Deleted)

7
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,200
Book me a flight.

8
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,080
No,

9
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,320
make that two tickets.

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,560
The next flight

11
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,480
to Qinmang.

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,580
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,520
Right now,
both Dingshun's transaction records

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,240
and Liu Gang's statement

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,520
are pointing the blame

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,600
at Ye Xiuming.

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,560
But just

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,120
when we were about to summon Ye Xiuming,

19
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,200
something happened to him.

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,220
And

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,480
Liu Gang also mentioned

22
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:29,111
that Wu only takes orders from Cripple.

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,280
We discovered

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
that the true owner of Jiji Trading

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,800
is Wu Bin.

26
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,260
Also, the footwear impression expert
examined the scene

27
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,400
where Ye Xiuming fell

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,920
and confirmed he was pushed.

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
The attacker's description matches

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,240
Wu Bin.

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,960
Bring Wu Bin in right away.

32
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,220
Zilin,

33
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:20,000
there is a project in Qinmang

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,688
that requires both of us to be there.

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,300
I booked today's flight.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,750
We can leave now.

37
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,133
So pack your things.

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,160
You can go alone.

39
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,640
I need to stay here
and look after Xiuming

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,300
and Qian.

41
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:33,733
I've already arranged

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,480
the best doctors and nurses for Mr. Ye.

43
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,260
As for Qian,

44
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,800
she should already be in Qinmang.

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,600
What do you mean?

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,666
I'll wait for you in the car.

47
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,330
Qian!

48
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,100
Ms. Fang.

49
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,720
Qian!

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,240
Ms. Fang,

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,080
didn't Mr. Wu say you were taking Qian

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,540
to Qinmang for a trip?

53
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,450
Why are you back?

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,960
Where's Qian?

55
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,400
Someone already picked her up
early this morning.

56
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,720
Hello, Yanyan.

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,640
Wu Bin took Qian

58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
to Qinmang.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,700
I don't know if that's true.

60
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,000
But now he wants me to go to Qinmang
with him.

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,260
Okay, got it.

62
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,960
Do you know

63
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,440
what time Qian was taken?

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,330
I was told this morning.

65
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,180
Zilin,

66
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,730
I think Wu Bin is faking it.

67
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:56,333
Qian might not have left the country.

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,070
Just stall him

69
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,200
and make sure you're safe.

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,080
And don't turn off your phone,

71
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,560
okay?

72
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,440
Okay.

73
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,520
All right.

74
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,610
I understand.

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,400
Jiajia.

76
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,720
Yes?

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Track Fang Zilin's phone.

78
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,080
Don't lose her.

79
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,520
Got it.

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,640
Mr. Wu, watch the house.

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,510
Okay.

82
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,940
Yan Lei,

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,640
Wu Bin is taking Fang Zilin
to the airport.

84
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
Get over there now.

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,880
Got it.

86
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,355
Rui, change of plans.
We're not going to Dingshun.

87
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,290
Wu Bin is making a run.

88
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,190
Director wants us to head straight
to the airport.

89
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,040
Where exactly did you take Qian?

90
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,200
Don't worry.

91
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,440
I'd never hurt Qian.

92
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,640
Or you.

93
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,680
But taking her without telling me

94
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,360
already hurts me.

95
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,680
Wu Bin,

96
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,730
we've known each other for years.

97
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,270
Xiuming and I both trust you, right?

98
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,320
Why are you doing this to us?

99
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,880
It's not too late to stop now.

100
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,680
I can help you.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,160
And I'm sure

102
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,755
Xiuming is willing to help you too.

103
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
We'll talk when he wakes up.

104
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,520
What do you mean?

105
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,080
This isn't the way to the airport.

106
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,222
Where are you taking me?

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,480
Answer me.

108
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
Where are you taking me?

109
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,160
Captain Han,

110
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,390
we tracked Fang Zilin's phone.

111
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,866
(Qinmang)
Wu Bin's car isn't going

112
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:06,000
toward the airport.

113
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:08,066
It's heading to the Qinmang border.

114
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:10,700
(Qinmang)

115
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,880
Jiajia just messaged. Wu Bin
isn't heading to the airport.

116
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,320
He's going to the Qinmang border.

117
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,880
Where are you taking me?

118
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,600
This isn't the way to the airport.

119
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,320
You kidnapped Qian,

120
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,400
and now you're taking me here.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,080
What are you up to?

122
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
Don't tell me

123
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,977
you're the one who pushed Xiuming.

124
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,280
Forget about him.

125
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,220
Just think about how happy
we'll be together.

126
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,200
Look at this transfer slip.

127
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,480
All the money

128
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,600
is already in an overseas account.

129
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,060
Are you insane?

130
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,320
You're mad.

131
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,960
You're crazy!

132
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,800
Give me the phone.

133
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,890
We trusted you for so many years!

134
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,920
Give me the phone!

135
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,320
You're crazy!

136
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll let you hear Qian's voice!

137
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,560
Give it to me!

138
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,070
I want...

139
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,910
Give me the phone!

140
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,880
Give it back!

141
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,040
Wu Bin! Give me the phone!

142
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,800
Stop the car! Stop!

143
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,440
Zilin!

144
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,440
I'll take you to Qian right now.

145
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,280
I'll take you there now.

146
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,880
Trust me.

147
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,960
Okay?

148
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,280
You'll see her soon.

149
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,500
(Yan Lei,
the immigration department says)

150
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,410
(there's no record
of Qian leaving the country.)

151
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,800
(She's probably still in Linshan.)

152
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,450
(We'll split up.)

153
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,200
(I've sent Ai Xin and Feng)

154
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,120
(to look for Qian.)

155
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:09,520
(You and Chang Rui will join
the Criminal Police Unit)

156
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,590
(to keep tracking Wu Bin.)

157
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,390
(Don't let them cross the border.)

158
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:12,920
(Yes.)

159
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,560
Ye Xiuming's neighbor saw

160
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
the nanny taking Qian

161
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,480
this way.

162
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,470
We checked the surveillance.

163
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,133
Two people
who looked a lot like Qian

164
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,340
and the nanny did come by.

165
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,370
Let's split up and search.

166
00:10:23,377 --> 00:10:23,866
Okay.

167
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,520
Qian is right ahead.

168
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Qian.

169
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,240
Qian.

170
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,040
Qian.

171
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,040
Over here, quick.

172
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,600
Excuse me.

173
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
This is Fang Zilin's daughter,

174
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
and you're her nanny, right?

175
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,200
Yes, I am.

176
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,590
Why did you come here?

177
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,520
Mr. Wu instructed us to wait for Zilin,

178
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,960
who would come to get us later.

179
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:45,040
Is something wrong?

180
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,200
Nothing.

181
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,040
Feng, call the Director.

182
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,720
Okay.

183
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,550
We're almost there.

184
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,480
Where's Qian?

185
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,720
I don't want to go any further.

186
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,800
Just another half an hour,

187
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,390
and we can start a new life.

188
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,520
What do you mean?

189
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,320
What do you mean
by we can start a new life

190
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,470
in half an hour?

191
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,240
Zilin,

192
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,555
just keep walking for half an hour.

193
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,120
You lied to me, didn't you?

194
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,130
Qian isn't here, is she?

195
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,240
Did you trick me?

196
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,120
You tricked me into coming here,
didn't you?

197
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,620
Tell me, Wu Bin.

198
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,890
Did you trick me?

199
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,960
Zilin.

200
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,890
Zilin, listen to me.

201
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,977
Are you out of your mind?

202
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,730
All these years,

203
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,840
we've helped you,

204
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,570
treated you well, and supported you.

205
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,180
This is how you repay us?

206
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,350
Yes, I tricked you.

207
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,140
If I didn't,

208
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,310
would you have come here?

209
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,160
All you ever care about is Ye Xiuming!

210
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,840
So

211
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,630
you were the one
who spread all those rumors

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
in the company, right?

213
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,950
I always saw you

214
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,440
as my benefactor.

215
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,040
Later, I even considered you
a close friend.

216
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,555
My husband and I treated you

217
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:29,900
as our most trusted partner.

218
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,580
And this is how you treat us?

219
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:35,111
So you think you and your husband
are my benefactors?

220
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,440
Listen here!

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,680
I achieved everything

222
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,400
through my own ability!

223
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,200
Without me,

224
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:45,800
would Dingshun be where it is today?

225
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,690
We built Dingshun together!

226
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:51,111
What does Ye Xiuming know?

227
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,279
He only came back

228
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,039
because he ran out of money
in Shencheng!

229
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,120
Where was he before that?

230
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:28,622
All right, I got it.

231
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,080
Rui,

232
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,555
Ai Xin says they've found Qian.

233
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,340
Tell the Director.

234
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,244
We'll split into three teams!

235
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,760
Move out.

236
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,650
Director,

237
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,155
we've spotted Wu Bin's car.

238
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
Zilin, I'm begging you.

239
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,720
Let me go.

240
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,470
Zilin!

241
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,100
Let's go.

242
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,780
Let me go!

243
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,280
Wu Bin!

244
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,380
Zilin, listen to me.
Just a few more steps

245
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,440
and we can have a new life!

246
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,270
Zilin!

247
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,320
Wu Bin!

248
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,320
Let her go!

249
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:14,666
Don't come any closer!

250
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,820
(China)

251
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,420
Wu Bin,

252
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:18,560
if you let her go now,

253
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,177
you might still get a lighter sentence.

254
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,920
Nobody move!

255
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,720
Wu Bin,

256
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,190
calm down.

257
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,466
I'm in charge here.

258
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:47,200
If you have something to say,
say it to me.

259
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,111
I want Officer Deng.

260
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,000
Bring her here.

261
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,530
Deng Yan.

262
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,780
Be careful.

263
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,555
Yes, Sir.

264
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,640
Stay right there.

265
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,920
So we finally meet,

266
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:07,840
human trafficker, Cripple.

267
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,340
Human trafficker?

268
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,400
Officer Deng,

269
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,555
you can't kill me.

270
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,920
Let us leave.

271
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,380
Wu Bin,

272
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,755
calm down.

273
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:19,311
If you want to talk, we can talk.

274
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,622
Just put the knife down first.

275
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,822
If you let us go,

276
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,120
I'll tell you where Lin Ran is.

277
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,520
Wu Bin,

278
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,600
you've destroyed so many families.

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,750
Don't you feel even a little remorse?

280
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,530
I will find Lin Ran.

281
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,670
But don't make things worse
for yourself.

282
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,140
It's not too late to turn back now.

283
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,920
Turn back?

284
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,160
How?

285
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,720
This is how society works.

286
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,040
The survival of the fittest.

287
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,360
I got what I wanted

288
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,360
in my own way.

289
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,430
Is that wrong?

290
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,040
Listen here.

291
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,560
Don't you know what you did is a crime?

292
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,940
A crime?

293
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,370
Do you have proof?

294
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,080
If I were lucky,

295
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,600
you'd never have caught me.

296
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,200
Wu Bin,

297
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,900
you overestimated yourself.

298
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,400
Do you think we'd be here without proof?

299
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,390
And I believe

300
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,010
you don't want to hurt Zilin, right?

301
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,840
Put the knife down.

302
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,888
That won't work on me.

303
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,700
Officer Deng, you've been looking
for Lin Ran for years.

304
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,810
Don't you want to know where she is?

305
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,680
I can tell you.

306
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,000
And I have money.

307
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,000
I know

308
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,900
police salaries aren't much.

309
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,960
I have money.

310
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,220
I have a lot of it.

311
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
I can give

312
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:34,688
you and your colleagues
enough money to last a lifetime.

313
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,740
All you have to do is let Zilin

314
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,490
and me go.

315
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,980
I'm not yours.

316
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,720
I'm not yours.

317
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,990
I'm not going with you.

318
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,390
You're insane.

319
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:48,355
- You've lost your mind.
- Sniper in position.

320
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm begging you, Zilin.

321
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,044
- Please let me go.
- Zilin, listen.

322
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:52,533
- Zilin.
- Please let my child go.

323
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:53,460
Don't do this.

324
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,620
- Zilin.
- I'm not yours.

325
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,040
I'm not going with you.

326
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm not yours.

327
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,866
Zilin, hear me out.

328
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,720
Zilin, calm down.

329
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,200
Have you forgotten about Qian?
If you work with me,

330
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,844
you'll see Qian soon.

331
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,980
Just let us leave!

332
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,180
Calm down, Wu Bin.

333
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,560
If you really love Zilin, let her go.

334
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:14,266
If you continue to be stubborn,

335
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,888
Zilin will end up dying because of you.

336
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,640
Do you really want

337
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,590
to watch the person you love die
in front of you?

338
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,400
Shut up!

339
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,760
Fire.

340
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,160
Xiuming.

341
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,070
Xiuming.

342
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,960
Xiuming.

343
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,920
Xiuming.

344
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,410
Xiuming.

345
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,720
I'm here.

346
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,080
I'm here.

347
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,320
I'm right here.

348
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,680
Zilin...

349
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,800
I knew you'd wake up.

350
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,640
I knew you'd wake up.

351
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,000
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

352
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,550
It is

353
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,970
all my fault.

354
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,290
Give me another chance

355
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,400
to love you

356
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,440
properly.

357
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,880
While you were unconscious,

358
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,480
I kept apologizing to you.

359
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
I know I've made many mistakes.

360
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
I'm sure you heard it all, right?

361
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,230
Where's Qian?

362
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Qian can already say "Daddy."

363
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,320
She even asked,

364
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,640
"Where's Daddy?

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,760
When is Daddy taking me
to the amusement park?"

366
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,133
So, when are you taking her?

367
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,410
Now.

368
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,320
We'll go right now.

369
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:11,350
I knew you couldn't bear to leave me.

370
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,560
While I was unconscious,

371
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,890
did you kiss me too?

372
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,480
Every day, I would say
"I love you" many times.

373
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,780
Before I leave,

374
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,050
I would kiss your forehead

375
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
so tenderly.

376
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,240
Every day, I would say,

377
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,350
"Xiuming, please wake up.

378
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,320
I promise I'll never argue
with you again,

379
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,100
okay? I love you."

380
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,100
I love you.

381
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,320
I love you.

382
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,640
I will love you.

383
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,280
For eternity.

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

385
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:22,770
That little boy from Wanshui

386
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:25,066
had just learned to talk, right?

387
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,360
Later, an agent introduced him

388
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:30,866
to an old couple in Linshan

389
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,760
and sold him to them.

390
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,250
I still remember

391
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,440
the look in his eyes.

392
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:39,488
How do I describe it?

393
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,750
It makes my heart ache.

394
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,600
But I had no choice.

395
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,450
That was his fate.

396
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:51,288
You still haven't told us about Lin Ran.

397
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,570
Where did you sell her?

398
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,440
Wu Bin.

399
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,980
At this point,

400
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:56,888
there's no point in hiding your crimes.

401
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,600
Yeah.

402
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:02,600
It has already come to this point.

403
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,240
Maybe this is my fate too.

404
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,880
I'll accept it.

405
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,920
I will tell you

406
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,880
everything I know.

407
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
But I really don't know

408
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,790
where Lin Ran is.

409
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,270
If I knew,

410
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,300
I would've told you already.

411
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,200
What do you mean?

412
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,890
That was my very first deal
when I entered the trade.

413
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,950
So I remember it clearly.

414
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,720
My master was still around then.

415
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,860
He handled it.

416
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,340
But the person who sold her out was Wai.

417
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,610
As for where Wai sold her,

418
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,680
you'll have to ask him.

419
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,830
Who was your master?

420
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,530
Where is he now?

421
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,733
He died a long time ago.

422
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,140
That old geezer was the real Cripple.

423
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,400
He made so much money

424
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,760
but never gave me a cent.

425
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,720
So I sent him

426
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,120
where

427
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,800
he deserved to go.

428
00:24:07,777 --> 00:24:10,177
Everyone only knew
the name "Cripple" in this trade.

429
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:11,933
So I use the name for myself.

430
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,330
Everyone thought
there was only one Cripple.

431
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,200
But it was just a code name.

00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:21,155

we found this
in Zhou Hongcai's case evidence.

Number 8610?

438
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,680
It's October 1986.

439
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,644
That was when Lin Ran was abducted.

440
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,280
Could the symbols above the numbers

be a location code?

I'm sorry.

507
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,840
I wasn't capable enough

508
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,130
to take you with me then.

509
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,560
Thankfully,

510
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:14,777

to cover your living expenses.

I'm still clear-headed,

528
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,760

00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,570
to keep this restaurant running
for quite a while.

537
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,844
This is such a huge matter.

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,380

When you're fully recovered,

547
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,688
you can come back and manage it.

(Searching For Reunion,

550
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,280
I used

551
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,600
to see people putting up
missing person notices.

552
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,430
It always made me feel both sad
and relieved.

553
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,510
I was sad

554
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,690
because another family
had been torn apart.

555
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,370
But I felt relieved

556
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,190
because their loved ones

557
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,600
never gave up searching.

558
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,000
My happiest moments were

559
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:33,720
when the children were finally found.

560
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,480
Then I would take down

561
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,688
the missing person's notice.

562
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,280
These days,

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,920
I forget a lot of things.

But

565
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,240
I clearly remember

566

helped reunite

Madam Zhang,

569
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440

from broken to whole again.

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,160
For many, it feels like home.

572
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,500
That's why

573
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,000
we have to keep

574
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:19,320
Tuanyuan Restaurant going,

575
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,440
no matter what.

576
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,740
Don't you agree?

577
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,980
Madam Zhang,

578
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,220
you're the heart of this place.

579
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,840
Don't worry.

580
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,160
We'll do everything we can

581
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,320
to keep it running.

582
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:10,260
(Chang Yongjun's Tomb)

583
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,340
(Chang Yongjun
was an outstanding officer.)

584
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,380
(He gave his life to exemplify
the ideals of a party member)

585
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,060
(and the mission of the police force.)

586
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,900
(His spirit will forever be engraved
in the hearts of the people,)

587
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
(inspiring future generations
to move forward.)

588
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,240
(The little girl
I told you about before, Luoluo,)

589
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,110
(was taken in by her sister.)

590
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
(She finally has a new home)

591
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,160
(and a new dad.)

592
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
He's my dad, and he's a police officer.

593
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,600
He's amazing.

594
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,040
I have a dad now!

595
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,970
(At first, when she called me "Dad,")

596
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,030
(I resisted.)

597
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,610
My dad is here!

598
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,690
(I resisted)

599
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,120
(because that word)

600
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,555
(reminded me of you,)

601
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,920
(my own father.)

602
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,177
Do you think I'm a good police officer?

603
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,840
Of course.

604
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,200
You're a good police officer.

605
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,890
Why?

606
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,840
Because you've caught many bad guys.

607
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,840
(You were not a great dad.)

608
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
(But now I understand)

609
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,770
(you were just doing
what you had to do.)

610
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,820
(He gave his life...)

611
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,340
(That's the life of an officer.)

612
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:19,460
(Maybe it's a regret I have to carry.)

613
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,790
(No matter how much I resisted,)

614
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,450
(I still became you.)

615
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,800
(And from now on,)

616
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,040
(I'll take on)

617
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,290
(the same responsibility,)

618
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:35,977
(protecting every home like you did.)

619
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,660
(Because I am your son.)

620
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:43,288
(I should get going now.)

621
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,511
(I'll come visit when I can,)

622
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,730
(Dad.)

623
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,620
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

624
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:58,000
I've figured it out.

625
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:01,600
(Ren, Ding, Tu, Fen. Tingchang)
These are actually two characters.

626
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,680
Two?

627
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:04,244
But aren't there four characters?

628
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:06,577
They're called
second-simplified characters.

629
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:08,160
They used to be written like this.

630
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,080
These writings

631
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,640
were phased out in the country
in the second half of 1986.

632
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,355
But some middle-aged and older people

633
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:19,760
still use them out of habit.

634
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,840
In standard simplified characters,

635
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:23,466
it should be written this way.

636
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,900
(Tingchang)

637
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,900
Tingchang.

638
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,200
That's why I believe

639
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:30,577
the clue in his stomach points

640
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,755
to Tingchang Village.

641
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,930
Feng, search Tingchang Village.

642
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,480
Got it.

643
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,577
(There are 23 Tingchang Villages
found in six provinces.)

644
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:41,133
Found it.

645
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,880
Across the country,
there are 23 Tingchang Villages

646
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,240
in six provinces.

647
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:45,990
Director,

648
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,240
should we issue

649
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,440
a joint investigation notice?

650
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,920
Do it, quickly.

651
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,360
Yes.

652
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,640
Director,

653
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,760
these are records
of the abducted victims

654
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,440
found based on Wu Bin's statement.

655
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,044
Many have already been confirmed
with the local police stations.

656
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,550
That's great.

657
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,180
(Case File)

658
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,560
We must find

every one of them

660
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,960
and send them home.

Looking back,

696
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,688
(2010 Linshan PSB Awards Ceremony)
our Linshan City Anti-abduction Office

697
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:42,911
has achieved a series
of remarkable results

698
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,440
in the fight

699
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,400
against the trafficking
of women and children.

700
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,640
However,

701
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,640
behind those achievements

702
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,690
are countless nights of stakeouts,

703
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,680
countless trips across the country,

704
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,080
and countless challenges.

705
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,120
For this,

706
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,480
we award

707
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,960
the Linshan City Anti-abduction Office

708
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,160
the honor
of a collective second-class merit.

709
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,100
(Collective Second-Class Merit)

710
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,000
Thank you,

711
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,270
Chief Xiao.

712
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,720
Thank you, Captain Han,

713
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,333
and thank you
to every one of my colleagues.

714
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,120
I feel deeply moved

715
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,690
as I stand here,
holding this hard-earned

716
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,800
Collective Second-Class Merit.

717
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,000
First,

718
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,930
I want to thank my teammates.

719
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,200
We are not just colleagues.

720
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,440
We are family.

721
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,550
(We encourage each other)

722
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:09,200
(and we support each other.)

723
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:10,590
Investigating anti-trafficking

724
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,300
is like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

725
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,160
It's hard to sort out.

726
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,430
You do not need me to comfort you.

727
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,880
You are the backbone
of our Anti-abduction Office,

728
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,520
right?

729
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:20,733
Because you are someone with conviction.

730
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,720
A person with conviction

731
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,720
cannot be bought

732
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,610
or corrupted.

733
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,970
You will return to the team.

734
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,950
No one is born fearless.

735
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:33,755
We all stumbled our way forward
through the dark.

736
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:36,466
(Countless moments of hardship
are still fresh in my mind.)

737
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,290

00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,560
(Linshan Public Security Bureau
Petitions Office)

739
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,820
do not want to hear
how hard you have worked.

740
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,020
What they want is a result.

741
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,480
What are the police even doing?

742
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,280
I only want to know

743
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,320
why you could not rescue

744
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,440
my daughter sooner.

745
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,010
If anything happens to her,

746
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,150
(We've been misunderstood)
I'm coming after you!

747
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,320
(and falsely accused.)

748
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,270
(Even our comrades)

749
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,155
(have given their lives for this cause.)

750
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,040
(But we never gave up.)

751
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,510
(Today's honor)

752
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,920

Of course,

756
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,240
we've also seen the joy and gratitude

757
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,880
of those victims
as they regained their freedom.

758
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,970
(Being a police officer
has never been just a job.)

759
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,120
(It is a choice,)

760
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,780
(a passion,)

761
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,200
(a conviction,)

762
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,088
(and a responsibility.)

763
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,520
(From the moment
we put on this uniform,)

764
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,900
(we vowed to protect our land)

765
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,600
(and keep our people safe.)

766
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,880
The fight against the trafficking
of women and children

767
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,600
is a long and heavy task.

768
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:06,960
We believe that one day,
not too far from now,

769
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,130
there will be no trafficking anywhere.

770
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,040
For that day,

771
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,830
we will never stop fighting.

772
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,320
The People's Police

773
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,710
will never back down!

774
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,180
(2010 Linshan PSB Awards Ceremony)

775
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:32,530
(Under the leadership
of higher authorities)

776
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:35,620
(and with support
from other police units,)

777
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,980
(the Linshan City Police Bureau)

778
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:41,270
(remains committed
to putting people first)

779
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,360
(and cracking down)

780
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,550
(on major local crimes.)

781
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,400
(After over 20 years of effort,)

782
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,970
(the police cracked
a major trafficking ring led)

783
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,830
(by Wu Bin and Liu Gang,)

784
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,580
(rescuing many women and children.)

785
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,620
(We salute the police
who remain steadfast on the front line!)

786
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,380
(We look forward to a world free
from trafficking!)

787
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,980
