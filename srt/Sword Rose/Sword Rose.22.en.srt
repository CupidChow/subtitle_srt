3
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,320
It says Deng Yan

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,880
took bribes

5
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,280
by abusing her position.

6
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,520
She's already been suspended.

7
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,440
Took bribes?

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Deng Yan?

9
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,800
Suspended?

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,120
Chief Xiao.

11
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,560
Are you serious

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,520
right now?

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
Do I look like I'm joking?

14
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,560
Then did Secretary Wei
from the Discipline Committee

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
jump the gun?

16
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:12,520
Did they have evidence?

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
They found a leather bag

18
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,120
in Deng Yan's closet at home.

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,560
It had 80,000 yuan in cash.

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,160
Neither Deng Yan nor her family

21
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,400
could explain where the money came from.

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,400
So they think

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,000
that's concrete proof now?

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
Xiao...

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,720
Well, Chief Xiao,

26
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:45,066
do you believe Deng Yan is the type
to pull something like this?

27
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,955
Of course, I don't buy it.

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,200
But there's a big sum
of unexplained cash just sitting there.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
You get what I'm saying?

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,640
You know how long Deng Yan has worked

31
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,360
in the Anti-abduction Office.

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,610
She's done amazing work

33
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,560
and caught many crooks.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
Don't you think it's possible

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,280
someone's trying to frame her
or get revenge?

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,000
Han!

37
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,711
The Discipline Committee

38
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,120
and Secretary Wei think this case

39
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,177
might be more complicated,

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,840
but they have to follow protocol.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,060
The Discipline Committee is leading
the investigation

42
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:16,666
into Deng Yan.

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,511
The Criminal Police Unit needs
to cooperate.

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,560
For now,

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,440
Yin will take over

46
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,688
her duties temporarily
at the Anti-abduction Office.

47
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,480
Chief Xiao, you were the one
who picked Deng Yan in the first place.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Why didn't you talk
to the Discipline Committee?

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,320
This will only discourage her.

50
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,377
You're pulling her
from the Anti-abduction Office...

51
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:36,000
All right, I'll handle it.

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
Fine.

53
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,250
Ms. Meilian.

54
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,800
Do you know how dangerous
it was yesterday?

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,580
That truck

56
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,880
almost hit Madam Zhang.

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,920
From now on,

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,120
we need

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,720
to be extra careful.

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,720
She can't go out alone anymore.

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,840
No,

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,760
we need to talk
to Madam Zhang about this.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
All right. Let's do it.

64
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,160
Madam Zhang,

65
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,266
what are you mumbling about?

66
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,560
I just feel like

67
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,680
there's something I'm forgetting.

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,000
But

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
I can't remember what it is.

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,440
Zhang,

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,320
from now on,

72
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:41,160
you've got to let us know
before you go out.

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,680
We can go with you.

74
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
That's right.
It was a really close call yesterday.

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,760
Right.

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,440
Okay.

77
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm sorry for making you worry.

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,040
It's fine.

79
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,480
I just...

80
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,960
I feel like

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
there's something I want

82
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,200
to say...

83
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,760
The more I think

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
about it...

85
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,560
Never mind.

86
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
We'll talk to her about it another time.

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,160
Okay.

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,720

(Missing Person)

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,440
Where's Ranran's photo?

91
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,120
Where did it go?

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,320
It's not here.

93
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,460

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,560
Don't move!

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
I remember now.

96
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:03,560
I remember everything.

98
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,600
This...

99
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
I remember it.

100
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,840
I remember it all!

101
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,240
This...

102
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,040
I remember everything.

(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

106
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,640
Director Deng?

107
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,533
Please come
to the restaurant right away.

108
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,640
Madam Zhang says

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,444
she has something important to tell you.

110
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
I'll be right there.

111
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,120
Sir,

112
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm selling it to you all together.

113
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,840
You're a smart boy.

114
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:58,920
If you sold it separately,

115
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,400
you'd get just 29.

116
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Because it's a bulk sale,
I'll pay you 35.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Thank you.

118
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,840
You're welcome.

119
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,600
Take this.

120
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,760
Thank you.

121
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:13,880
All right. Take care.

122
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,960
Hello?

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,760
Can you call my dad over?

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,880
I need to talk to him.

127
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
Didn't you hear?

128
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,250
Your dad's condition relapsed again.

129
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
He's been bedridden for a week now.

130
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,533
My dad and the other adults
are taking care of him.

131
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,200
Hello?

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,440

(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

135
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,266
Madam Zhang,
what did you need to tell me?

136
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,400
Yanyan.

137
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,960
Listen,

138
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,150
the guy who was on TV...

139
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,240
the...

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,680
the wanted criminal!

141
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:43,840
- Wanted criminal?
- The wanted criminal. Yes.

142
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,320
He came

143
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,960
to the restaurant.

144
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,030
The wanted criminal showed up here?

145
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes.

146
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,320
He...

147
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,120
He asked

148
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,040
a lot about Ranran.

149
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
When he saw her photo,

150
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,480
he acted like

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,680
he knew her.

152
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,200
He's the trafficker

153
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:01,160
who kidnapped Ranran!

154
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,160
Madam Zhang,

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,480
I'll show you a photo.

156
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,160
Is this the man?

157
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,555
Yes, that's him!

158
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:08,710
That's definitely him!

159
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,550
When was he here?

160
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,840
The night before last.

161
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,360
He was sitting right there.

162
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Okay, got it.

163
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
I'm going after him.

164
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:18,760
Look after Madam Zhang.

165
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,080
I thought he looked suspicious

166
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,400
the other night.

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,911
He didn't seem like a good guy.

168
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Don't worry. We'll catch him.

169
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,840
Captain Han.

170
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,840
Come in.

171
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,040
Captain Han, I have an urgent report.

172
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,480
What's so urgent?

173
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,000
Go ahead.

174
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:44,340
It's about Zhou Hongcai.

175
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,240
Tuanyuan...

176
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,070
Hold on.

177
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:48,960
Deng Yan,

178
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,880
you're still suspended.

179
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,880
Captain Han,

180
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,200
but this is really important...

181
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,190
Zhou Hongcai...

182
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,120
Sit down first.

183
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,100
Take a seat and tell me.

184
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,866
Sit down and talk.

185
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,100
Here's the situation.

186
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,480
Zhou Hongcai went to Tuanyuan Restaurant

187
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
asking about Lin Ran.

188
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,710
So I suspect Zhou Hongcai
might be connected

189
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:08,444
to Lin Ran's case.

190
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,120
And?

191
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,720
I know I'm not allowed to be involved

192
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,840
in arresting Zhou Hongcai,

193
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,680
but even if I can only help a little,

194
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,800
I want to do my part.

195
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,710
Deng Yan,

196
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,240
if I approve this,

197
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,520
I'd be

198
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,410
breaking the rules.

199
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,600
If I don't approve it,

200
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,400
well, I know you're innocent.

201
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,600
How am I supposed to answer that?

202
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,330
As director

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,360
of the Anti-abduction Office

204
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:45,280
and as a police officer,

205
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,160
if you always act

206
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,120
on your own judgment,

207
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,200
then what's the point of laws

208
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,480
and regulations? Right?

209
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Let's not even get into your suspension.

210
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,080
Even if you were reinstated,

211
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,200
given the way things are now...

212
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,160
Sure,

213
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,360
having empathy

214
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,400
is good.

215
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,440
But too much of it

216
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,960
can mess

217
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,840
with how you handle the case.

218
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,222
You wouldn't be able
to see this through with a clear head.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,266
I think this is for the best.

220
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,880
You should go back

221
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,400
and wait

222
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,080
for the Discipline Committee's

223
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
next update. All right?

224
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,160
Deng Yan,

225
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,440
do you trust

226
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,840
the system?

227
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,600
I do.

228
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:42,730
Then, for now, go back.

229
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
New update.

230
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,129
I just heard

231
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,960
that Zhou Hongcai went
to Tuanyuan Restaurant

232
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,790
asking about Lin Ran.

233
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,840
Lin Ran?

234
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,520
That's an old case.

235
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,120
Lin Ran is Madam Zhang's daughter
from Tuanyuan Restaurant,

236
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:10,240
and she's also
Director Deng's childhood friend.

237
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
She was abducted
when she was very young.

238
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
Director Deng was actually
a witness in that case.

239
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,920
I just ran

240
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,290
into Director Deng.

241
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,160
She was coming out
of Captain Han's office

242
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,400
and looked really upset.

243
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,160
It's probably because she's suspended

244
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,400
and can't be involved
in Zhou Hongcai's case.

245
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,800
She must be

246
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,880
so frustrated

247
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
about being held back.

248
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:35,200
What do you guys think about the money

249
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,520
they found at her place?

250
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,320
It has to be a setup.

251
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:44,644
Enough with the gossip.

252
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:46,640
Don't you guys have work to do?

253
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:52,000
Not watching, Xin?

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
I have something else to do.

255
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,590
All right.

256
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,940
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

257
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,520
Director Deng.

258
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,040
Mr. Yin.

259
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,340
Captain Han mentioned
you stopped by earlier.

260
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,040
Why didn't you check
on the Anti-abduction Office?

261
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm not here to comfort you.

262
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,160
You've got to trust the system.

263
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,022
The truth will come out in the end.

264
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,600
Well, you don't need me to cheer you up.

265
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:32,039
You're the backbone
of the Anti-abduction Office.

266
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,680
Right?

267
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,040
Thanks, Mr. Yin.

268
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,160
I'm fine.

269
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,177
I'll let you get back to work.

270
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:42,888
All right.

271
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,160
How did he know about me?

272
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,520
He even came looking for me.

273
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,840
Yes.

274
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,280
How did he track you down?

275
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
And how did you end up

276
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,120
involving him in our business?

277
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:08,080
You and Wai aren't working together,
are you?

278
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,240
Gang.

279
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,160
You don't actually suspect me, do you?

280
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,280
It wasn't me.

281
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,040
I swear,

282
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,160
it really wasn't me!

283
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,640
What possible reason would I have?

284
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,400
That's hard to say.

285
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,520
Maybe you want

286
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,800
to cut me out and go solo.

287
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,400
Gang,

288
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
I swear it's not me.

289
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,920
Everything I have

290
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,160
is because of you.

291
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,120
If I ever even thought about that,

292
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,444
may I be struck by lightning.

293
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,560
Gang,

294
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,240
I'm just a woman.

295
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,360
How could I dare?

296
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,066
I don't have that kind of capability.

297
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
You know exactly

298
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,960
what I'm capable of.

299
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,960
If it wasn't you,

300
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
then could it be him?

301
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,600
Gang,

302
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,600
who are you talking about?

303
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,920
Never mind.

304
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,320
So,

305
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,280
what do we do now?

306
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
He knows who you are.

307
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,840
And the police are all over him.

308
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,720
Gang,

309
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,520
are you really planning
to hide him forever?

310
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,280
That old guy's a ticking time bomb.

311
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,200
If he blows up,

312
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,640
we're both done for.

313
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,160
You're right.

314
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,080
Gang,

315
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,840
maybe we should

316
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
take care of him while he's

317
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:39,466
in our control...

318
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,720
Slowly.

319
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,200
Qi,

320
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,360
I...

321
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,180
I can't make it tomorrow.

322
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,560
It's okay.

323
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,733
It's just my old injury acting up.

324
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
Yuan's aunt is coming tomorrow.

325
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,666
You don't need to come by every day.

326
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,760
We live in the same village.
We help each other.

327
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,133
You just rest and take it easy.

328
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,080
Once I finish all my work,

329
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,444
I'll take you to the hospital
in the city.

330
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry for the trouble.

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
It's nothing.

332
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,720
Mr. Qi.

333
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,960
Mr. Qi.

334
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,760
Who is it?

335
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,760
Who are you

336
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,720
looking for?

337
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,820
Is Mr. Qi home?

338
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,240
Yes, he's here.

339
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:43,960
He's right here.

340
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,840
Please come in.

341
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:46,920
- Mr. Qi.
- Officer Yan.

342
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,040
What happened?

343
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,720
Why are you here?

344
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:52,160
Is your back bothering you?

345
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,480
My lumbar disc is acting up.

346
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,400
It's an old problem.

347
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Mr. Qi.

348
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,960
Did Yuan

349
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
come back to see you?

350
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,555
No, he didn't.

351
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,870
Is something wrong with Yuan?

352
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,750
He left earlier than we.

353
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,840
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

354
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,160
That boy probably

355
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,160
didn't want to spend money on a ride

356
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,120
and got held up.

357
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,400
Mr. Qi.

358
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:17,600
Yuan might have

359
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,520
sneaked back to see you.

360
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,080
But don't worry,

361
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,200
he's a big boy now.

362
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,044
He won't get lost.

363
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:24,377
I'm going to go look for him now.

364
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,560
Officer Yan.

365
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,880
He likes

366
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,760
to take the little path along the river.

367
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,640
Got it. You rest up.

368
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,240
Mr. Sun.

369
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,960
Make yourself comfortable.

370
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,190
Don't mind me, Mr. Qi.

371
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,320
You should lie down.

372
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,960
Easy there.

373
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,200
Qi,

374
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,560
you have a guest.

375
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,640
I'll head out now.

376
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,360
Go ahead.

377
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,360
Thanks.

378
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,620
Don't mention it. I'll leave now.

379
00:18:54,622 --> 00:18:55,222
Thank you.

380
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,480
Well,

381
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,000
how's it going with Yuan?

382
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:08,800
It's going well.

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,700
But he still needs

384
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,760
some time to adjust.

385
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,560
He'll get used

386
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,120
to it.

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,120
He must have missed you so much

388
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,155
that he snuck out.

389
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,200
That makes me feel better.

390
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,920
He used to go

391
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,000
into the city with me
to collect recyclables.

392
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,000
He knows that road well.

393
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Mr. Qi,

394
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,440
that boy was sickly

395
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,260
when he was little.

396
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,644
You must have spent a lot on him.

397
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,120
I had

398
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,880
saved up 20,000 back then,

399
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,450
planning to get married.

400
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,160
But then I found Yuan...

401
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,120
That's a life.

402
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,120
So I spent the money.

403
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,080
Mr. Qi,

404
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
how could you bear

405
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,640
to send him back to me?

406
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,520
You don't understand.

407
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,720
Our village is poor.

408
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,720
There's only one school.

409
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
All the kids, from toddlers to teens,

410
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,511
are taught
by just one teacher.

411
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
His teacher was kind.

412
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:28,870
He knew we were struggling,

413
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,280
so he looked out for Yuan.

414
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:33,177
Now Yuan is about

415
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,640
to start middle school.

416
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
The teacher told me

417
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,640
Yuan's a good kid.

418
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,360
He could even

419
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,440
get into college someday.

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,640
I didn't want to send him away either.

421
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,440
But we have to do what's best for him.

422
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,800
Yuan's always been a clever child.

423
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,320
His birth parents

424
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,440
must be well-educated.

425
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:02,520
If it weren't for the traffickers,

426
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:04,955
Yuan never would have ended up with me.

427
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,800
But no matter what,

428
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:08,920
we can't hold back
the kid's future, right?

429
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,680
Right.

430
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,680
Xiaoguang,

431
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,749
is this the back massager
you bought for your dad?

432
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,911
That's very thoughtful of you.

433
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,920
Mr. Qi. Mr. Sun.

434
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,822
We brought him home.

435
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:36,350
Xiaoguang.

436
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:36,977
Yuan!

437
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,720
- Yuan!
- Dad!

438
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,644
Are you feeling better?

439
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,644
Don't get up.

440
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,070
Mr. Qi,

441
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:43,320
Sun Xiaoguang knew
about your back problem

442
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,177
and got this back massager
especially for you.

443
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,600
He didn't want to spend money
on the way back,

444
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,460
so he hitched rides and walked a lot.

445
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,760
That's why it took so long.

446
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:56,150
Now that Yuan's home safe,
we can finally breathe easy.

447
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,777
We've got work to do,
so we'll get going.

448
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:58,520
Get some good rest.

449
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,440
Thank you all so much.

450
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,577
It's no trouble at all.

451
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:02,088
Don't worry about it.

452
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,120
Mr. Sun.

453
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,600
The boy is in your care now.

454
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,200
Don't run off again.

455
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,050
Take care.

456
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,640
Yuan,

457
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,088
you shouldn't have spent money on this.

458
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,920
My back injury is an old problem.

459
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,290
I just need to lie down for a bit
and it'll be fine.

460
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,800
Let's return this.

461
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:36,400
Save the money for his education.

462
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,560
Xiaoguang,

463
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,240
you skipped breakfast

464
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,288
and used the money
from selling recyclables

465
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,720
to buy this, didn't you?

466
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,040
I misunderstood you.

467
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,400
You should've told me

468
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,000
about Mr. Qi.

469
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,160
I would have bought it for him.

470
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,622
We could've come to visit him together.

471
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,450
Running off alone

472
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:00,911
was too dangerous.

473
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,160
It's not just me who worries about you.

474
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,920
Mr. Qi worries about you too.

475
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,960
Mr. Qi,

476
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,560
I'm sorry.

477
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I didn't care for you enough.

478
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,222
On behalf of his mother,

479
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,240
I thank you.

480
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,040
You gave him a second chance at life.

481
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,040
It's the least I could do.

482
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,320
Can we bring my dad into the city too?

483
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,080
Of course.

484
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,880
Why didn't I think of that?

485
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,950
That won't work.

486
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,740
Xiaobing's dad is here,

487
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:42,822
and your aunt...

488
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:43,400
Lie back down.

489
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,288
We're all used to living together here.

490
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,720
If I went to the city,

491
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,640
I wouldn't even know east from west.

492
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,920
I'd be completely lost.

493
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:51,120
I wouldn't be used to it.

494
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,380
Mr. Qi,

495
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,640
please come back with us.

496
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,320
Yuan,

497
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,240
be good.

498
00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:58,360
Go back with your father.

499
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Mr. Qi,

500
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,040
please come with us.

501
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:04,377
Dad...

502
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,640
Can I stay here and take care of him?

503
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,920
It won't affect my studies.

504
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,430
We'll stay here together

505
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,555
and look after Mr. Qi.

506
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,610
That won't do.

507
00:24:32,622 --> 00:24:33,360
You can't do that!

508
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:33,859
Calm down.

509
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,377
Yuan is about to start middle school.

510
00:24:35,377 --> 00:24:35,880
You can't...

511
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
If he stays,
it will affect his education.

512
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,520
Yuan,

513
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:39,977
go back with your dad!

514
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,520
Mr. Qi, lie down.

515
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,400
Mr. Qi.

516
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,466
I've thought about it.

517
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,040
You were worried

518
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,040
about education in the village, right?

519
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,320
Now the Youth League
Central Committee has

520
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:55,880
a poverty alleviation program.

521
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,040
I'll sign up and apply

522
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,333
to teach in the village.

523
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,320
That way,

524
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
Xiaoguang won't have to go back,

525
00:25:03,822 --> 00:25:04,844
and you won't have

526
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,400
to worry about his schooling.

527
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:07,320
That's not possible.

528
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:07,840
The...

529
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:08,933
- The boy...
- Mr. Qi...

530
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,400
Mr. Qi.

531
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,440
Please don't get up.

532
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,120
You raised him for 11 years.

533
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,190
Xiaoguang wants

534
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,080
to stay and take care of you.

535
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,577
He's my only emotional support.

536
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,560
Please give me this chance.

537
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:31,511
Do you mean it?

538
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,200
Yes.

539
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,350
I just thought of it a moment ago.

540
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:45,333
Dad...

541
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,066
Dad...

542
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,080
Madam Zhang?

543
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,960
Madam Zhang?

544
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,880
Xiaoxing.

545
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
You stayed here all night?

546
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,680
I...

547
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,480
Yes.

548
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,720
Yes.

549
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,080
I was waiting for a call.

550
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,320
A call?

551
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,320
What call?

552
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,400
Well...

553
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,880
Yanyan went out

554
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,520
to catch the child trafficker, right?

555
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,240
If they catch him,

556
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,240
they might have news about Ranran.

557
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,680
I'm waiting to hear something.

558
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,440
Why didn't you just wait

559
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,320
at home?

560
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,840
You can't just sleep here.

561
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,880
I couldn't find

562
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,440
my phone.

563
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
I thought

564
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,800
if they called the restaurant,

565
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,360
I'd be here to answer.

566
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,160
Madam Zhang,

567
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,720
how about this?

568
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,360
Go home and get some rest.

569
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,920
I'll wait for the call for you, okay?

570
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm not tired.

571
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,640
I can sit here and wait.

572
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,520
Madam Zhang,

573
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
if you keep this up

574
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,080
and Ranran comes back,

575
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,680
she'll feel awful

576
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,400
seeing you like this.

577
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,720
You need to get some sleep.

578
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,380
I'm fine.

579
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
The moment I heard

580
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,800
there might be news about Ranran,

581
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,080
I stopped feeling tired.

582
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,240
I'm fine.

583
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,210
I'm wide awake.

584
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,160
Okay,

585
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,920
then I'll wait with you.

586
00:27:59,520 --> 00:27:59,880
Okay.

587
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,160
Leave the door open.

588
00:28:02,177 --> 00:28:02,640
All right.

589
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,720
Open all the doors.

590
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,000
I'll make you something to eat.

591
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,140
(Missing Person)

592
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,177
You like playing games, huh?

593
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,020
Like to mess around?

594
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,040
Let's try something new.

595
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,320
Old man,

596
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,120
don't get nervous.

597
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,640
I'll be back
to have some real fun with you.

598
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,000
Boss,

599
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:54,200
I was just dealing with that old guy.

600
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,240
You took care of him?

601
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,880
That guy was so arrogant.

602
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,400
I want to make him suffer a little more.

603
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,120
Make it quick.

604
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:01,466
Don't leave any loose ends.

605
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,320
Who's that?

606
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,840
Who threw that?

607
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,480
Where are your manners?

608
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm watching you!

609
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,044
Throwing stuff again, huh?

610
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,960
Gang,

611
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,680
I'm going to finish him off now.

612
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,720
Open up!

613
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,660
I know you're in there!

614
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,080
Old man, behave yourself.

615
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,080
If you make a sound,

616
00:32:43,888 --> 00:32:45,288
I'll end you when I come back.

617
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:59,320
Is this the right apartment?

618
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,320
Yes, this is the one.

619
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,080
Open up!

620
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,040
Open up!

621
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,680
I know you're in there.

622
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,120
Open up!

623
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,160
The lights are on.

624
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,480
Open up!

625
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:21,622
If you don't open the door,
I'm calling the police!

626
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,520
What do you want?

627
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,410
What...

628
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,840
What were you doing?

629
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:30,080
You almost killed someone!

630
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,520
You're disturbing the peace.

631
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,150
There are neighbors
living above and below.

632
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,080
You should think about that.

633
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,920
Is that all?

634
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,280
Wait. We didn't solve anything.

635
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:44,577
He had quite the attitude too.

636
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,560
Open up!

637
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,520
Open up!

638
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,920
Open up!

639
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:53,933
Open this door right now!

640
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,480
Open up!

641
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,440
If you don't open up,
I'm calling the police!

642
00:33:58,644 --> 00:33:59,755
What do you want?

643
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,880
You disturbed the neighborhood.

644
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,650
You can't just walk in

645
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,560
without saying a word.

646
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:07,850
You have an attitude problem too.

647
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,560
If you're going to act like that,

648
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,088
then let's settle this
at the police station.

649
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,840
Wait.

650
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,640
You bothered him too.

651
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,160
Keep it down.

652
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:39,120
That's more like it. Let's go.

653
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,760
Lucky day.

654
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:53,800
We got 200 for nothing.

655
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,880
Let's go eat at that place again.

656
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,420
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

657
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:06,488
Vice Director Yin,

658
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
the station got a report.

659
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,422
A resident said they saw someone
who looked like Zhou Hongcai

660
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,866
climbing out of an apartment window.

661
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,360
Where?

662
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:16,311
Fuhua Residential Area, Beigou Street.

663
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,440
Let's go.

664
00:35:18,755 --> 00:35:20,040
Get Chang Rui to come along.

665
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,480
All right.

666
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,280
He climbed down that window
along the wall.

667
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,120
A lot of us saw it.

668
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,720
The guy looked old.

669
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:35,840
He had a wound on his face.

670
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,280
Wearing a hat. Carrying a backpack.

671
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,720
He looked panicked.

672
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,088
So I called the police right away.

673
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,520
My friend and I were walking by

674
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,120
when a glass bottle came
flying down from an upper floor.

675
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
I looked up

676
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
and another one came down.

677
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,080
What if that bottle had hit me

678
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,400
in the head?

679
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
That could have been serious.
It was dangerous.

680
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:54,222
Did you see
which apartment it came from?

681
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,480
That one.

682
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,280
That window.

683
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:58,400
It was thrown from there.

684
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,640
- Zhang Tao.
- I saw it myself.

685
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,960
Come here.

687
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,488
Are you the landlady?

688
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,400
I am.

689
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,680
But we didn't sign a lease.

690
00:36:09,755 --> 00:36:12,155
I had no idea they were involved
in something like this.

691
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,000
Officer,

692
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm a victim too.

693
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,400
All right.

694
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,280
Wait here.

695
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,080
He was about this tall.

696
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,680
He took off running in a flash.

697
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:26,680
He ran really fast.

698
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,400
Well,

699
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,000
I went upstairs to confront him...

700
00:36:36,955 --> 00:36:38,022
What did you find?

701
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:39,288
Based on the investigation,

702
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,720
the place was a temporary rental

703
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,844
with no lease signed,

704
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,120
so no records were left.

705
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,040
From the damaged railing

706
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,400
and fingerprints on the wall,

707
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,200
it looks like at least two people

708
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,360
were involved.

709
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,020
There are also signs
that someone was being held there.

710
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:56,520
According to eyewitness descriptions,

711
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,280
the person who climbed out the window

712
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,760
matches the age

713
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,720
and build of Zhou Hongcai.

714
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,400
A case of criminals
turning on each other.

715
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:12,300
Have you seen a hat, backpack,
or pair of shoes like this?

716
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,044
We're from
the Linshan City Police Bureau.

717
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,200
Have you seen an older man,
about 60 years old,

718
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:19,120
with gray hair,
wearing a beige plaid shirt?

719
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,510
No, I haven't seen anyone like that.

720
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:21,600
What about a younger man,

721
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,040
maybe in his early 20s?

722
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,360
Short hair, black clothes,

723
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,560
kind of aggressive-looking.

724
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,419
He went that way.
Couldn't see him after he went further.

725
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:30,955
That way.

726
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:40,960
Vice Director Yin,

727
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,733
we've almost finished
searching this area.

728
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,800
Nothing turned up.

729
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,560
After him!

730
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:22,240
Stop right there!

731
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:35,960

735
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:02,911
According
to Vice Director Yin's description

736
00:39:02,955 --> 00:39:04,777
and the surveillance footage,

737
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:06,840
Zhou Hongcai was in that small truck.

738
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,066
But once it turned down a narrow alley,

739
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:10,577
it disappeared from all the cameras.

740
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,444
Yan Lei and Feng

741
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:13,200
have already gone
to find the truck driver.

We don't know
if they'll get anything useful.

743
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:17,622
What about the rental apartment?

744
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,760
We checked.
It was rented under a fake name.

745
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,680
The landlady said
she never saw the tenant

746
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:24,444
and doesn't know Zhou Hongcai.

747
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:30,244
We've already issued a citywide
wanted alert for Zhou Hongcai,

748
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,840
so he's definitely trying

749
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,920
to get away.

750
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,240
I'll talk with Vice Director Yin

751
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,644
and organize another search.

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,920
Wai ran off.

759
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,440
You need to find him

760
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,044
and make sure he never talks again.

761
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,200
The police will catch him before you do.

762
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,800
Understood.

763
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Keep an eye on the police.

764
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,880
The moment they get close,

765
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,240
we strike first.

766
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,720
Got it.

767
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:09,822
Chang Rui.

768
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:11,244
I think Wai might try

769
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,466
to take an unlicensed cab
to get out of the city.

770
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,549
He just arrived in Linshan,

771
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,969
so he doesn't know his way around yet.

772
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,560
The only place he knows
for an illegal cab

773
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,333
is the place where he got off last time.

774
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,711
Let's head back to the terminal.

775
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,200
Okay.

776
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,300
(Noodles)

777
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,720
Why hasn't Yanyan called yet?

778
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,960
Madam Zhang,

779
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,120
if Director Deng hears anything,

780
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,080
she'll let you know right away.

781
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,000
Would you like something to eat?

782
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:06,880
You haven't eaten
or had anything to drink.

783
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,720
If Yanyan comes back

784
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,110
and sees you like this,

785
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,720
she'll be so worried.

786
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,760
I'll make you some noodles.

787
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,710
Yanyan!

788
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,200
Is your daughter's name Lin Ran?

789
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,440
Who are you?

790
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,680
That doesn't matter.

791
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,000
I...

792
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,160
I know where Lin Ran is.

793
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,040
Lady,

794
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,630
I want 10,000.

795
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,240
Not 100,000.

796
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,040
Just bring the money

797
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
to the bus stop on Qingcheng Road

798
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,720
right now.

799
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,080
I'll be waiting there.

800
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,040
All right?

801
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,590
