=Episode 14=

3
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,400
Will this Lu Sheng case

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,430
have a big impact on Dingshun?

5
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Of course.

6
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,230
Right now, our company's finances
are extremely tight.

7
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:47,844
There's a huge hole to fill.

8
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:49,222
I don't even know where to start.

9
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,150
If things get worse,

10
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,120
I'll have to go out
and chase down clients myself.

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,400
Not the first time I've done that.

12
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,840
Who introduced Lu Sheng

13
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,950
to Dingshun for business?

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,555
Our deputy general manager.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,950
Are they close?

16
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,190
Definitely not.

17
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,444
If they were, would he have
taken on a deal like that?

18
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,280
But things are tough
in foreign trade right now.

19
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,150
Otherwise, we wouldn't be scrambling
to take every deal,

20
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,888
causing this much trouble for ourselves.

21
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:27,090
(Dingshun Group)
Did Director Deng send us to Dingshun

22
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,622
because she suspected something?

23
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:30,550
She said the contract
between Lu Sheng and Dingshun

24
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:32,577
was handled by a deputy general manager
named Wu Bin.

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,640
Hello.

26
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,750
Hi.

27
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:37,270
We're here to see Wu Bin.

28
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,470
Mr. Wu, yes?

29
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,310
This way, please.

30
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,000
Officers,

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
I've made up my mind.

32
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,111
I want to report something.

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
I want to cooperate.

34
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:56,960
Who are you reporting?

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Wait.

36
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,960
Can I ask something?

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,240
Do I get anything

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,120
for reporting this?

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,710
Start talking first.

40
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,120
How much

41
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,590
is saving a kid worth?

42
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,290
You think
this is some kind of flea market

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,422
where we haggle over prices?

44
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:12,840
If you want to say it, say it.

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,680
I'll talk.

46
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,190
I'll talk.

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,680
It's...

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,640
It's She Qinglin's kid.

49
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,555
The child was kidnapped
about a month ago.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
Who is She Qinglin?

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
The general manager
of Kaiyi Trading Company.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
Officers,

53
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:33,430
is there anything you need from me?

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
We just want to understand a few things.

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
Go ahead.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,150
Do you have a client named Lu Sheng?

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,590
Yes.

58
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,430
Did he recently sign a big deal?

59
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,590
Yes.

60
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,577
As you know,

61
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,520
our company handles import
and export trade in Southeast Asia.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,910
Lu Sheng signed a contract with us

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,710
to buy dendrobium from Qinmang.

64
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,590
We fronted him five million
for the purchase,

65
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,990
but then

66
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,333
there was a shipping accident.

67
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
To date,

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,750
his company still hasn't

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,590
reimbursed us.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,030
That's a large sum.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,470
Surely

72
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,711
that means you have
a strong relationship with him.

73
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,750
Well, there was

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
a certain level of trust
from previous deals.

75
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,270
Why didn't he file
a missing child report?

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,440
Are you lying to us?

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
No, I'm not!

78
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,120
Please calm down.

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,430
I'll start from the beginning.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,630
I think

81
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,600
it was

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,560
two months ago.

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,750
She Qinglin came

84
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,310
to our company to buy dendrobium.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
Smaller companies like his
usually don't need much.

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,270
So,

87
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,430
as usual,

88
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,040
I collected the deposit first.

89
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,390
Then we had Dingshun Group handle

90
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,279
the shipment from Qinmang.

91
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,390
Who could have known
a shipping disaster would happen?

92
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,870
The whole shipment was lost.

93
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,679
Since then,

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,888
She Qinglin has been showing up
at my office every day,

95
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:50,733
causing a scene.

96
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,720
Do you know Lu Sheng personally?

97
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,710
Are you close?

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
We've run into each other a few times.

99
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,510
What's he like in real life?

100
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,600
He's got a temper,

101
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,111
and he's a bit of a womanizer.

102
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,160
I'm coming in.

103
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,590
Come here!

104
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,333
Where do you think you're going?

105
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,680
I'm coming to get you!

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,222
Where do you think you're going?

107
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,230
Mr. Lu?

108
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,790
Sorry.

109
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,422
I had a little too much to drink

110
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:24,660
and walked into the wrong room.

111
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,310
My bad.

112
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,270
Excuse me.

113
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,230
Sorry.

114
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,040
Really sorry

115
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,350
to bother you.

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
(Walking in on that)

117
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,470
(was awkward.)

118
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
(I left in a hurry.)

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
So

120
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,110
that's what happened.

121
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,160
Was this the girl?

122
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,480
Uh,

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
it was a while back.

124
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:48,111
I don't remember all the details,

125
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,030
but

126
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,350
she had long hair.

127
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,390
He came to my office every day,

128
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,750
making a fuss.

129
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,920
He just wouldn't stop.

130
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,390
Tell us why
Skinner kidnapped She Qinglin's kid.

131
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,160
Like I said,

132
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,680
he was like a leech,

133
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
sticking to me day after day.

134
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,510
I just got sick of it.

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Mr. Lu.

136
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,350
Have a seat.

137
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:12,160
I'll just stand.

138
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,911
I need to talk to you about something.

139
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,150
What is it?

140
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,110
Mr. Lu,

141
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,600
I've already paid.

142
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,190
And now you're telling me
the goods are gone?

143
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,560
You...

144
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
at least owe us an explanation.

145
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,350
Qinglin,

146
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,120
I already told you.

147
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:37,000
The shipping accident
was a natural disaster.

148
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,555
There's nothing I can do about it.

149
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,830
If I don't get that shipment,

150
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,240
you've got to refund me.

151
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,190
Otherwise,

152
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,830
I'm going bankrupt, Mr. Lu.

153
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,470
She Qinglin,

154
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:50,133
don't you think you're going too far?

155
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,360
You waited for me outside my office
the day before yesterday.

156
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:55,280
Yesterday, you cornered me
in the parking lot.

157
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,920
And now you're showing up at my house.

158
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,311
What exactly do you want from me?

159
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,070
Go back

160
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,488
and read that contract again.

161
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,480
It clearly says losses

162
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,240
from force majeure

163
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,040
are shared by both parties.

164
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,466
You want me to refund you?

165
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Then who will refund me?

166
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
I...

167
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,240
I understand

168
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,680
what the contract says.

169
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,310
But I'm out of options here.

170
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm desperate, Mr. Lu.

171
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,310
Please...

172
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:24,270
Please just reconsider.

173
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,710
If you would...

174
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,480
Just...

175
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
Just give me half.

176
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,630
Half would be enough.

177
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,470
She Qinglin.

178
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,000
Listen up.

179
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:32,510
You're not getting a single cent back.

180
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
If you don't like it,

181
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,190
sue me.

182
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,440
Got it?

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
Get out!

184
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,390
Mr. Lu...

185
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,350
Ms. Zhang!

186
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,310
Show him out.

187
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,950
Mr. Lu, please, just hear me out....

188
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,466
Mr. Lu...

189
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:43,066
Please leave.

190
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:43,510
Stop...

191
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,350
Get out of my sight!

192

194
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,430
You listen to me!

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
Don't try me!

196
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,680
If I go down,

197
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,600
you're coming with me!

198
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
I give you an inch,
and you take a mile. Leave!

199
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,933
Please leave.

200
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,390
Don't push me! I can walk on my own.

201
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,666
You're going to regret this!

202
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Here's my problem...

203
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,022
(That makes you an accomplice.)

204
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,890
You were the one
who told Skinner to do it.

205
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,310
I'm not an accomplice!

206
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,040
That's not what I meant.

207
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,950
All I wanted

208
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,750
was for Skinner

209
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,920
to scare him off.

210
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Make him stop bothering me.

211
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,800
I never meant

212
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,070
for him to actually

213
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,480
kidnap the kid.

214
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,680
You scared me.

215
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
What are you doing here?

216
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm begging you.

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Please.

218
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,640
Mr. Lu,

219
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
I don't want the money anymore.

220
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,600
Just don't hurt my child.

221
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,480
Please, Mr. Lu.

222
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,670
Please don't hurt my child.

223
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,240
Please...

224
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,530
What are you even talking about?

225
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,480
Who hurt your kid?

226
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,550
If you say that again,
I'll sue you for slander!

227
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,270
Mr. Lu,

228
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,030
I'm begging you.

229
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,720
I said. Get lost!

230
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,360
Did you hear me?

231
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,790
Please!

Just don't hurt my child.

I'm begging you.

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,270
- I don't need the money anymore...
- Security!

236
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,440
Get him out of here!

237
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
Please, Mr. Lu!

238
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,933
Stop causing a scene here!

239
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,040
Mr. Lu!

240
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,750
Mr. Lu,

241
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,080
I don't want the money anymore!

242
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
Don't hurt my child,

243
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,560
Mr. Lu!

244
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,390
I don't want the money anymore!

245
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,150
This is inhumane.

246
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,480
No conscience at all.

247
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,670
I'm not that kind of person.

248
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,270
I'm only saying all this

249
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,720
because I want credit

250
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,120
for cooperating.

251
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,990
All right.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

252
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
Don't leave!

253
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,440
Officers,

254
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,630
this counts
as a major contribution, right?

255
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,510
Officers!

256
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,840
Does this count?

258
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,360
Mr. Liu,

259
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,440
do you know Fei Yan?

260
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,680
Fei Yan?

261
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,870
Mr. Fei, right?

262
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,550
Yes.

263
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:36,711
He's a regular
at Tianhai Lucky Entertainment Center.

264
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,750
Likes to spend big.

265
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Do you know him well?

266
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:41,960
Officer, that's a funny question...

267
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:44,533
Let me put it this way.

268
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
I know almost everyone

269
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,790
who's been to Tianhai Lucky.

270
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,120
But knowing someone
doesn't mean we're close.

271
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,030
Did something happen to him?

272
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,870
Do you have security footage?

273
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,120
We do, but not much.

274
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:02,120
And we only keep footage

275
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
for about a month...

276
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
Take us to the security room.

277
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,880
Of course.

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
Come with me.

is that him?

284
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,630
Yes, that's the guy.

285
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,670
Was that the last time you saw him?

286
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Yes.

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,870
What happened to him?

288
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,670
Do you know...

289
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,630
Enough.

292
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,288
If he contacts you again,

293
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,600
please let us know right away.

294
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,720
Of course.

295
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,630

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

298

We checked the client records
for Tianhai Lucky.

299
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:12,670
Fei Yan really was a regular there,

300
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,600
but it all looked like normal spending.

301
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,630
Nothing unusual.

302
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,266
What about Liu Gang?
What do you think of him?

303
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
Also seemed normal.

304
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,000
When we asked how he knew Fei Yan,

305
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,750
he just said Fei was a customer.

306
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:27,890
They didn't have much
of a relationship beyond that.

307
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,533
I think Liu Gang is hiding something.

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,080
It felt like he knew we would show up.

309
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,120
Knew what we would ask.

310
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,080

315
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,000
So far, nothing suspicious.

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,550
But he did give us

317
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,030
one lead.

318
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,910
He said he saw Lu Sheng at Tianhai Lucky

319
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,120
with a girl

320
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720

just do it! No questions asked.

and things you don't.

367

How much of what Lu Sheng said
do you think is true?

He's not getting out
of his sexual assault charge.

That name rings a bell.

379
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,440
Do you have anything to do

380
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,555
with his child's abduction?

381
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,000
Definitely not.

382
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Officer,
I'd never do something as horrible

383
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,360
as trafficking children.

384
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Let me remind you

385
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,910
that this case ties back to Mr. Li.

386
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,670
Mr. Li?

387
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,440
Right. That incident.

388
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,000
She Qinglin rubbed Mr. Li the wrong way,

389
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
so he told me to send a couple of guys

390
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,390
to "teach him a lesson".

391
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,320
That part is true.

392
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,200
Listen. I don't want that woman anymore.

393
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,080
Send her back.

394
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,030
I'm done with her!

395
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,150
All right, all right.

396
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,670
Calm down.

397
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,155
Give me a couple of days.

398
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,840
I'll find you someone better.

399
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,533
Just wait for my call, all right?

400
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,200
What happened?

401
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,200
Who or what's got you

402
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,480
so worked up?

403
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,150
They're just some pathetic thugs.

404
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
They're not even worth my time.

405
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,333
Come on,

406
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,270
thugs are my specialty.

407
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,360
Tell me who,

408
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,030
and I'll handle it for you.

409
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,920
Lu.

410
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,350
Here's my problem...

411
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,800
And how did you handle it?

412
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,750
Be specific.

413
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,910
Well,

414
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:21,888
I was just feeling things out at first.

415
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,630
Before I could even get rolling,

416
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,160
I got a call

417
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,480
from Old Yellow Dog.

418
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,750
You mean

419
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,040
Huang Chuan?

420
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,790
(I don't know his real name.)

421
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,390
(Everyone on the street calls him)

422
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,480
(Old Yellow Dog.)

423
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
(Could be)

424
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,360
(the same guy?)

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,550
Why did he call?

426
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,155
Asked to borrow some money.

427
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
Finally,

428
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,510
you're here.

429
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,680
Dog,

430
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,110
what's so urgent?

431
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,960
We can't be seen together.

432
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,088
Cripple doesn't like it.

433
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,750
If he finds out

434
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,760
about this...

435
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,110
I'm desperate.

436
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,720
Skinner,

437
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,030
I'm in a tough spot.

438
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,510
You have to help me.

439
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Dog,

440
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,720
you're one

441
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,110
of Cripple's

442
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,880
biggest suppliers.

443
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:49,755
You've got your own turf, just like me.

444
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,750
What happened

445
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,030
to you?

446
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,390
Don't ask.

447
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:54,800
The cops have been

448
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,110
cracking down hard.

449
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,920
They raided my territory.

450
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,880
Madam Hong disappeared

451
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,750
and took all my money with her.

452
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,590
You left all your money

453
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,160
with her?

454
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,640
We'd been living and running things
together for 20 years.

455
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,070
Never thought she'd bail on me

456
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,150
when things went south

457
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,550
and take all the money too.

458
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,240
Dog,

459
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,590
sounds like that was true love.

460
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,710
Look, man,

461
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,550
things are heating up right now.

462
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,200
I have to get out of Linshan fast.

463
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,630
Please,

464
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,630
lend me some money.

465
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,430
I swear

466
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,880
I'll pay you back.

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,840
Dog,

468
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,080
why not

469
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,750
go to Cripple?

470
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,070
You think I didn't try?

471
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,040
But can you even track him down?

472
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,510
You know how he is.

473
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,990
I'm begging you.

474
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,950
Help me.

475
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,110
Please.

476
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,200
When I bounce back,

477
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,760
I promise

478
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
I'll pay double.

479
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,630
Dog.

480
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,720
I can't

481
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,200
lend you money.

482
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,666
That'd break the rules.

483
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,800
However,

484
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,910
I can hook you up

485
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
with a job that pays fast.

486
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,950
What job?

487
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
Well...

488
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,830
I don't know what happened

489
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,840
after that.

490
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,080
Wang Guangqing,

491
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,830
you say
you're against child trafficking.

492
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,680
So why give Huang Chuan

493
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,030
that idea?

494
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,920
That's aiding and abetting.
You understand that?

495
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,790
How is that aiding?

496
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,000
He wouldn't stop calling
and pestering me.

497
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,200
Mr. Li needed to hire someone

498
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,440
to teach She Qinglin a lesson.

499
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,110
I never told him to kidnap a kid,

500
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,320
right?

501
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,288
Did he contact you again after that?

502
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,910
No.

503
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,920
Do you remember what he looks like?

504
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,000
In his 50s.

505
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,280
And

506
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,510
average height.

507
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,270
Kind of balding.

508
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,720
His most obvious

509
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
feature

510
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,030
is a mole

511
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,680
right here

512
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,520
on his face.

513
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,640
Bring in the sketch artist.

514
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,040
All right.

515
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,260
(Anti-abduction Office)

516
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,750
How did it go, Mr. Yin?

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,111
Wang Guangqing talked.

518
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,350
She Qinglin's child

519
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,310
is connected to Huang Chuan.

520
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:18,080
Here's his statement.

521
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:21,070
But Jiajia checked the system.

522
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,960
She Qinglin didn't file
a missing child report.

523
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,280
Director.

524
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,169
Vice Director Yin.

525
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,490
Here's the sketch of Huang Chuan.

526
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,800
Take a look.

527
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,790
This sketch

528
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,030
is a big step forward.

529
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,350
Should I ask Chief Xiao

530
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,750
for approval

531
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,910
to issue a warrant?

532
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,280
Not yet.

533
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,520
No need to rush.

534
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:45,333
We've been after this guy

535
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:46,177
for 20 years.

536
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
He's slippery.

537
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,510
Issuing a warrant now

538
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,270
might just scare him off.

539
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,760
Right.

540
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,640
And we still need

541
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,590
more intel on him.

542
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,990
I already sent

543
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,111
Yan Lei and Jiajia
to follow up with She Qinglin.

544
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,044
Let's hear what he has to say first.

545
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:13,460
(Kaiyi Trading Company)

546
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,270
(Company For Sale)

547
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,466
200,000, and it's yours.

548
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,400
We can negotiate.

549
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,340
(General Manager)

550
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,830
180,000 works too.

551
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,590
When can you come by?

552
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,110
Okay, got it.

553
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,830
Are you here to check out the company?

554
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:31,910
I can show you around.

555
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,310
We're police. We need your cooperation
for an investigation.

556
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,390
What's this about?

557
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,070
We're here regarding

558
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,160
your contract dispute with Lu Sheng.

559
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,630
Officers,

560
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,422
that matter was already settled.

561
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:47,888
There's nothing more to discuss.

562
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,488
According to Lu Sheng,

563
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:51,480
you approached him
about your missing child.

564
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,040
Um...

565
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,000
No, I didn't.

566
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,760
Are you sure?

567
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,000
That's not what we heard.

568
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,120
It's a misunderstanding.

569
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:01,333
Just a misunderstanding.

570
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,750
My son is fine.

571
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,280
Officers,

572
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm about

573
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,640
to sell the company.

574
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:07,840
I'm done with business.

575
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,600
I'm going back to farming.

576
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,070
Thank you for your concern.

577
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,200
I'm really busy today.

578
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,533
I can't entertain you.

579
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
Please leave.

580
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,870
Please.

581
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,310
Let's go.

582
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,150
Yes, that's me.

583
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,960
Yes, I'm selling the company.

584
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,830
The price is negotiable.

585
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:32,688
She Qinglin is definitely

586
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:33,590
hiding something.

587
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,520
I think so too.

588
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,509
Let's report back
to Director Deng first.

589
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,910
Let's go.

590
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,870
All right.

591
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,820
(Kaiyi Trading Company For Sale)

592
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,070
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

593
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,910
(Jiajia,)

594
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,600
(are you sure She Qinglin
never reported it to the police?)

595
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,720
He didn't.

596
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,040
He said
it was all just a misunderstanding.

597
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,750
But both main suspects

598
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,960
have already admitted
to kidnapping the child.

599
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,960
If he's the victim,
why would he cover it up?

600
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,822
That means something's off
with the victim.

601
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,300
(Wang Guangqing,
Old Yellow Dog, Madam Hong)

602
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:18,200
The case involving Lu Sheng

603
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,110
and Zheng Weiwei is connected

604
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,070
to Wang Guangqing,

605
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:24,960
and She Qinglin's son's abduction

606
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,550
is also tied to Wang Guangqing.

607
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
And both of them have links
to the dendrobium trade.

608
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,480
We need to keep digging
into She Qinglin.

609
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,160
So his son really is with him.

610
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:51,111
Good thing the boy's safe.

611
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,880
But why is he moving now?

612
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:02,155
Obviously, he's trying to avoid someone.

613
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,350
Yan Lei,

614
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,790
check the surveillance footage
from the property management.

615
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,520
Director,

616
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,480
we found something.

617
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,070
Let's go, Cong.

618
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,350
She Qinglin,

619
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:30,480
we need to ask you a few more questions.

620
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,560
Officer,

621
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,840
I've already

622
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,070
told you everything.

623
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,310
My child is fine.

624
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,350
See?

625
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,790
He's right here.

626
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,510
I've got nothing more to say.

627
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,710
And

628
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,030
I'm already moving,

629
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,350
so please

630
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,110
just leave me alone.

631
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:48,240
Cooperating with the police

632
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
is every citizen's duty.

633
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,070
We won't take up much of your time.

634
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,960
This will only take a few minutes.

635
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,110
All right.

636
00:24:57,577 --> 00:25:00,240
Here's footage from the security cameras
in your residential area.

637
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:07,820
(Entrance Surveillance)

638
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,910
You're mistaken.

639
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,830
That old man is a distant relative.

640
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,320
He was just joking.

641
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,590
It was a prank.

642
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:19,066
He returned our son right afterward.

643
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:21,888
That old man goes
by the name "Old Yellow Dog."

644
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,350
He has a history
of child trafficking offenses.

645
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,755
We've been tracking him for years.

646
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,222
We hope you can provide any leads,

647
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:28,888
so we can catch him as soon as possible.

648
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,720
So your son really

649
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
was kidnapped before?

650
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,990
Moving won't help

651
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,160
if he's not caught.

652
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,590
If he did it once,

653
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,840
he'll do it again.

654
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,150
Do you hear that?

655
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,880
That man really is a trafficker.

656
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,640
What are you talking about?
A trafficker?

657
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,430
What trafficker?

658
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,590
Our son is right here.

659
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,310
I'm not making things up!

660
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,822
The police are right here!

661
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:52,488
This is the time
to tell them everything!

662
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,400
Tell them!

663
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,310
Do you want us to lose Cong again?

664
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,780
(Entrance Surveillance)

665
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,070
(That day was August 9, 2009.)

666
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
(I got a strange text
while I was at work,)

667
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,600
(so I rushed straight home.)

668
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,960
Cong?

669
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,390
Cong!

670
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,430
Cong!

671
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,040
Where's Cong?

672
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,640
He's gone...

673
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,622
Did you call the police?

674
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:38,030
Not yet. I'll call them now.

675
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,870
Wait.

676
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,190
(I have your son.)

677
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,840
(Drop 30,000 in the trash bin
at the bus stop by 9 PM.)

678
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,400
(If you call the police,
you'll never see your son again.)

679
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:45,440
Do we have money in the house?

680
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,630
Yes!

681
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,590
Go get it!

682
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,700
(Sanitation Worker Rest Area)

683
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,720
Give me the money.

684
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,750
There's no one around.

685
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,550
Cong...

686
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,030
Quiet.

687
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's get out of here.

688
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,840
Let's go.

689
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,110
Come on.

690
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,590
Did you get

691
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,110
your child back after paying?

692
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,320
No.

693
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:42,980
(Even after I dropped off the money,)

694
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,920
(our son didn't come back
at the agreed time.)

695
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,844
It's already past midnight.

696
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,350
When is Cong coming back?

697
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,040
Calm down.

698
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,110
I can't calm down!

699
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,440
Will our son really come back?

700
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,320
I'm calling the police!

701
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,920
No! We can't call the police!

702
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,960
Why not?

703
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,400
Let them investigate!

704
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,860
If we call them, they'll kill our boy!

705
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:09,679
That's nonsense!

706
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,850
Let's wait a little longer.

707
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:11,920
I'm done waiting!

708
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,920
- Calm down.
- Give me...

709
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,377
(Then I got another message)

710
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:17,030
(telling me to think carefully
about who I might have offended.)

711
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:18,311
(That's when it hit me.)

712
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,350
It must be Mr. Lu.

713
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,022
I had no choice
but to go apologize to Mr. Lu.

714
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,080
Please.

715
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,550
I don't need the money anymore.

716
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,000
Just don't hurt my child.

717
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,110
I'm begging you, Mr. Lu!

718
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,160
Please don't hurt my child.

719
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,830
Please!

720
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,890
What are you even talking about?
Who hurt your kid?

721
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,866
If you say that again,
I'll sue you for slander!

722
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:36,555
(But strangely,)

723
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,240
(he seemed completely clueless.)

724
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,440
(When I was at a loss for what to do,)

725
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,844
(the kidnapper sent another text
with an address.)

726
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,480
(I went to the address)

727
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:45,600
(and that's where)

728
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
(I finally found my son.)

729
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,150
Over there!

730
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,110
He's right there!

731
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,280
- Cong!
- Cong!

732
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,320
- Cong...
- Cong...

733
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,630
It's me.

734
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,030
I'm here, Cong.

735
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,720
It's okay.

736
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
Let me hold you.

737
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,780
(I know where you live. Call the police,
and I'll kill all of you.)

738
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,000
(I was terrified.)

739
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,480
(So I never reported it)

740
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,960
(and stopped asking Mr. Lu
about the payment.)

741
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,000
(Later, I heard Mr. Lu got arrested.)

742
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,550
(I was scared those people
would think I tipped off the police)

743
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,590
(and come after me again.)

744
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,160
That's why I wanted

745
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,111
to get out of Linshan
as fast as possible.

746
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,510
That 30,000 was probably

747
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,880
extorted by Huang Chuan.

748
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,590
If they had been reported sooner,

749
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,510
Huang Chuan might already be
in custody now.

750
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:38,270
There's one thing
I still don't understand.

751
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,830
Why did Huang Chuan return the boy?

752
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,400
He got the money.

753
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:44,400
They already paid the ransom once.

754
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,110
Why stop there?

755
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,160
If he hadn't returned the child,

756
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,970
he could've blackmailed them
over and over.

757
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,333
He could've even sold the boy.

758
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,000
It wouldn't be the first time.

759
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,350
So

760
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,790
what made him

761
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,510
back off

762
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,720
this time?

763
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,590
I don't get it either.

764
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:02,822
Do you think he caught wind of something

765
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,200
and called it off?

766
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,960
What if She Qinglin

767
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,000
had reported it immediately?

768
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,000
We were

769
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,790
interrogating Meng Gui at the time.

770
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:16,110
If he'd gone to the police,

771
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,280
there's a good chance
Huang Chuan would've been caught.

772
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,750
He knew Madam Hong was wanted

773
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,310
and stopped She Qinglin from reporting.

774
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,000
He was scared
Madam Hong would give him up.

775
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:30,310
And the reason
he didn't want that was because...

776
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:32,000
He never planned to leave.

777
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,440
Does that mean

778
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,880
Huang Chuan is still in Linshan?

779
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,430
A few years ago,

780
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,200
we had a case involving
the trafficking of women.

781
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,030
We knew the trafficker was Huang Chuan.

782
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,000
We set up checkpoints
at stations, ports,

783
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,310
and every possible route.

784
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:52,444
But when the time came
for the final arrest,

785
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,750
he got away.

786
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,680
He never came near

787
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,977
the checkpoints.

788
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:59,590
He slipped away through
the remote mountains and forests.

789
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
That was the closest
I ever came to catching him.

790
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,670
I think

791
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:09,622
I have a good read on him.

792
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,355
He's different from Wang Guangqing.

793
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,640
He targets remote mountain areas,

794
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,155
trafficking women and children there.

795
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,720
So the place he's hiding

796
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,550
has to be
the mountainous regions near Linshan.

797
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,270
There's only one location that fits.

798
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,920
Mangma Town,
at the foot of Shangrui Mountain.

799
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,320
Ai Xin.

800
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:30,466
Get in touch
with the Mangma Town Police Station.

801
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:31,750
Have them issue a public notice

802
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,130
and mobilize the local community.

803
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,488
We can't let that sly fox get away.

804
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,590
Yes.

805
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,660
(Wanted)

806
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
(Wanted)

807
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,870
Sir,

808
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,920
how much are these sunglasses?

809
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,000
18.

810
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,840
What about this pair?

811
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,040
20.

812
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
Can you go any lower?

813
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,640
They are original imports.

814
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:28,288
That's already a good price.

815
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,790
My hats are imported too.

816
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:40,000
I'll give you a discount.

817
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,080
Take a look at them.

818
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,630
Director Deng.

819
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,550
We got word from Xu.

820
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,160
Our people

821
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,400
spotted Huang Chuan.

822
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,600
This is the screenshot.

823
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,155
All right. I'll go
with Chang Rui to check it out.

824
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:31,044
I'll go too.

825
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,670
Mr. Yin,

826
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,750
it's a long trip.

827
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,870
Let's split up.

828
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,200
You contact the local police station
and set up surveillance.

829
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,511
Chang Rui and I will head over
to assess the situation.

830
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,430
Okay.

831
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,390
Be careful

832
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,550
out there.

833
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,640
Drive!

834
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,740
(September 5, 2009,
Pengcang Mountain, Linshan City)

835
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,910
This is your stop.

836
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,160
All right.

837
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,720
Be safe.

838
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,030
- Chief Xu.
- Chief Xu.

839
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:30,880
Join us.

840
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,920
No, thank you.

841
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,320
Just a few reminders.

842
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,800
There have been

843
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
a lot of mountain fires

844
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,550
lately,

845
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,280
so take caution.

846
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,670
If you see any strangers,

847
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,360
call the station immediately.

848
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,470
- All right.
- Yes, Sir.

849
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,470
All right.

850
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,360
No problem.

851
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,440
All right. Thanks.

852
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Chief Xu, have something.

853
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,280
Join us.

854
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,840
- Take care.
- Take care.

(Forest Ranger)

856
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,980
(Police)

857
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,670
All units, listen up.

858
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,160
Time is of the essence for this mission.

859
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:18,100
Start the search
from the west side of Pengcang Mountain

860
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,880
and work our way up.

861
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:19,400
Clear?

862
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,200
- Clear!
- Clear!

863
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,222
Report any updates to me immediately.

864
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,100
(Forest Ranger)

865
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,840
Sirs,

866
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,800
it's dark.

867
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,000
Can I ask a favor?

868
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:20,510
What's your situation?

869
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,200
I'm just

870
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,280
a hiker.

871
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,800
I like to wander in these mountains.

872
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,190
But this mountain's a bit strange.

873
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,670
I got lost while hiking,

874
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,800
and now it's dark.

875
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,760
Can I stay with you

876
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,120
tonight?

877
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,160
No, you can't.

878
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,760
Something happened here before.

879
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,550
Sirs,

880
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,550
please.

881
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,720
Put that away.

882
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,680
No smoking here.

883
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,030
Look.

884
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,488
I'll check with my superior

885
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:51,970
to see if we can send someone
to escort you down the mountain.

886
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,800
But staying overnight

887
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,640
is not an option.

888
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,240
I see.

889
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,510
Then...

890
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,280
Then

891
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,880
I won't bother you.

892
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,990
Thank you.

893
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,150
You two

894
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,990
keep busy.

895
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,500
(Linshan City, Nanjie Province)

896
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,800
Mr. Yin.

897
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,280
Got it.

898
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,550
That woman really

899
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,840
screwed me over.

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

901
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,240
Vice Director Yin.

902
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,377
Director Deng and the others are back.

903
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:44,550
- You're back.
- Director!

904

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

906
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,470
Get in,

907
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,430
Mr. Yin.

908
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,710
Mr. Yin, you're the hero this time.

909
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,444
We might not have caught Old Yellow Dog
if you hadn't identified

910
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,550
his escape route.

911
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,190
Tell me how you guys caught him.

912
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,440
(After your call,)

913
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,280
(we got the forest rangers to lead us.)

914
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,230
(They said a hiker had gone
into that area)

915
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,550
(the night before.)

916
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,066
(I thought it was strange.)

917
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,333
(Who would be heading that way
at a time like this?)

918
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,670
Everyone, stay alert.

919
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,133
Things have been unsafe
in the mountains lately.

920
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:42,888
Especially with wild boars
running loose.

921
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,510
Hunters have set plenty of traps.

922
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,977
Don't wander off. Stay close.

923
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,280
Help!

924
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,240
Help!

925
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,280
Help...

926
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,320
Help...

927
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Come and help!

928
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,390
Help...

929
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,510
He's the hiker

930
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,066
who asked to stay with us last night.

931
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:06,240
Don't touch that!

932
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,200
It hurts...

933
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,000
Don't touch that...

934
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
We wanted to have someone
escort him down,

935
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,780
but he insisted on exploring more.

936
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,640
Look at him now.

937
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,110
Stubborn old mule.

938
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:20,430
Now he's in real trouble.

939
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,200
That trap is meant for wild boars.

940
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,990
You're not a boar.

941
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,430
You're Old Yellow Dog.

942
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,933
We got you now.

943
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,311
Just my luck...

944
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,760
(He admitted)

945
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,400
(he heard a wild boar)

946
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,160
and tried to hide,

947
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,030
but ended up stepping into the trap.

948
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,600
That thing

949
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
must've hurt.

950
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,400
We've got a nice present
for the Detention Center.

951
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,760
Yes?

952
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,720
Who's this?

953
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,470
Boss!

954
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,622
Old Yellow Dog's caught!

955
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,150
Darn bad luck...

956
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,100
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

957
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,800
Madam Zhang,

958
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,030
why are you still here?

959
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,070
Qian,

960
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,440
please give me a few more days.

961
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,930
I'm trying to figure something out.

962
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,190
It's not that I don't want to,

963
00:42:12,422 --> 00:42:14,444
but I waited a long time for you
to renew the lease

964
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:15,466
and you never showed up.

965
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,288
I already signed a contract
with someone else.

966
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:18,820
They're coming soon
to check the shop lot.

967
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,110
If they see you're still here,
I'll have to pay a penalty!

968
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,720
Qian,

969
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,440
- I understand your situation...
- Qian.

970
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,800
Qian.

971
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:25,960
Mr. Shi.

972
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,800
My men are here.

973
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,688
Why are they still here?

974
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,070
They're moving out now. Right now.

975
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,266
I can't wait a second longer.

976
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:32,288
Tear down those posters.

977
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,960
Tear them down!

978
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,800
Move the tables too.

979
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,155
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

980
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
What are you doing?

981
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,280
You can't do this!

982
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,320
You're hurting my business
by not moving out.

983
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,550
If you won't move, I'll move you!

984
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,800
Don't tear it!

985
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,844
What do you think you're doing?

986
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,670
Stop!

987
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,550
Give me that!

988
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,030
Don't tear it!

989
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:50,880
Don't tear it!

990
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,710
Let go!

991
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,710
Stop!

992
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,640
Stop!

993
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,120
Don't do this!

994
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,620
