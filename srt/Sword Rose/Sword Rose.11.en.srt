=Episode 11=

3
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,630
What do you mean?

4
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,066
What is that?

5
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,900
(Help)

6
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,900
Officers.

7
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,700
I suppose it counts as redeeming myself.

8
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,220
Plus, I turned myself in.

9
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,500
You should be lenient to me.

10
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,460
You turned in a note
from half a month ago.

11
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,022
And you call that turning yourself in?

12
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,500
It's not like
I'm going to just hand myself over.

13
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,180
Did you go back later?

14
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,140
No.

15
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,140
Really.

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,980
Officers.

17
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,820
When I left, that guy told me

18
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,060
I'm now one of their VIPs.

19
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,488
I'm welcome to go back anytime,

20
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,780
but I never went back.

21
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,220
Someone in there called for help.

22
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,780
That place is surely shady.

23
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,420
What are you doing?

24
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,660
Boss.

25
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,660
Don't you hear

26
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,755
all that commotion?

27
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,060
Boss.

28
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,577
Can't I just get a peaceful day?

29
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,140
It's not their fault.

30
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,900
Business has been dead lately.

31
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:17,180
There's not a single job.

32
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,820
Everyone's frustrated.

33
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,540
I'm frustrated too.

34
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,180
The police patrol every day.

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,266
Who will come out to have fun?

36
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,980
Boss.

37
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,420
How about

38
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,580
we contact those VIPs?

39
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,860
We have to make some money,

40
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,222
and they can't be that frustrated,
can they?

41
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,260
No.

42
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
It breaks the rules.

43
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,020
How about this?

44
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,460
Tell them you'll go tonight.

45
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,180
Hello?

46
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,140
Yeah.

47
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,460
Of course.

48
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,020
Today?

49
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,460
Sure, no problem.

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,644
We'll pick you up at 7 PM, same place.

51
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,300
See you.

52
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,540
Boss.

53
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,500
We got a job.

54
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,900
Did I say yes?

55
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,420
I'm telling you.

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,355
The police are checking every day.

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,020
Be careful.

58
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,220
No problem.

59
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,500
Last time, Luo Yi was blindfolded

60
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,420
and driven for an hour.

61
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,311
So we focused on the massage parlor,

62
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:00,780
setting up surveillance in all areas

63
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,860
that could be reached within an hour.

64
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,940
Plus, Lei and Rui
are monitoring from front and back.

65
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,780
It should be fine.

66
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,500
Slow down.

67
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,060
Buddies.

68
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,220
Why

69
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,380
is the drive longer than last time?

70
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,700
Impatient?

71
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,300
Don't worry.

72
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,340
This girl

73
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,800
is even better than last time.

74
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,660
No.

75
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,260
I want

76
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,622
the same girl as last time.

77
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,820
Alright.

78
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,780
No problem.

79
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,660
Lei.

80
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
They're suspicious.

81
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,377
I'll leave. You follow them.

82
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,700
Let's go.

83
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,820
(Mangshan Villa)

84
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,060
Why stop?

85
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,340
Nothing. There's a car crash ahead.

86
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,300
We'll move soon.

87
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,000
(Mangshan Villa)
Weird.

88
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,688
They've been there for a while.

89
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,300
What kind of driving is that?

90
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,860
Look what you did to my car.

91
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,460
Take a look.

92
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,340
I can't drive?

93
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,820
Whose fault is it?

94
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,340
Director Deng.

95
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,300
Yan Lei.

96
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,820
What's the situation?

97
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,820
There's a traffic jam.

98
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,020
I can't see the target.

99
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:47,330
I worried I'd lose them.
Should we arrest them earlier?

100
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,460
Don't panic.

101
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,180
Our ultimate goal now

102
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,688
is to find their hideout.

103
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,380
Okay.

104
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,820
Look.

105
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,260
I was driving normally.

106
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,580
Normal?

107
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,800
I was driving normally too.

108
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:17,140
I was just passing from the left.

109
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,220
Making a regular right turn.

110
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,180
What a huge turn, huh?

111
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,260
Do you own the road?

112
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,500
Alright, stop arguing.

113
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,022
I just bought this car. I don't care.

114
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:25,580
Alright, calm down.

115
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,711
Turn right. Quick, turn right!

116
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:44,555
Target has turned right.

117
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:46,977
I'm stuck here. I can't get through.

118
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,860
I'm following them.

119
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,060
(Youth should stay away from drugs.

120
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,100
Well...

121
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,220
Why aren't we there yet?

122
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,220
Mr. Luo, calm down.

123
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,620
Good things are worth the wait.

124
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,020
We're almost there.

125
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,580
Hurry.

126
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
(Mangshan Villa)

127
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,700
This location

128
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:47,133
is the upscale villa district,
Mangshan Villa.

129
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,540
(Mangshan Villa)

130
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,300
(July 25, 2009,
Mangshan Villa, Linshan City)

131
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,180
Mr. Luo, we've arrived.

132
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,540
We're here?

133
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,540
Careful.

134
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,660
Here.

135
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,822
Watch your steps.

136
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:30,620
Okay.

137
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,511
Mangshan Villa Number 12.

138
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,780
Attention.

139
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,620
This is 1201.

140
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,022
Target has been confirmed
to be at Mangshan Villa Number 12.

141
00:10:41,044 --> 00:10:42,660
Mangshan Villa Number 12. Hear that?

142
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,740
Check him.

143
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,900
I'll do it myself.

144
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,700
Mr. Luo.

145
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,180
You know the rules.

146
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,700
I'll keep these safe for you.

147
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:11,780
Alright.

148
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,510
Take him upstairs.

149
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,260
Okay.

150
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,420
Who do you want?

151
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,100
Sir, your car's been scraped.

152
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,333
Come out and handle it.

153
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,540
Who did it?

154
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,380
Who are you?

155
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:47,911
Don't move. Police!

156
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,780
Turn around.

157
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,740
Police!

158
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:55,580
Don't move!

159
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,420
Hands on your head
and squat against the wall!

160
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,260
Don't move.

161
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,780
Skinner!

162
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm one of you.

163
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,220
I was sent here by the police.

164
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,340
I didn't do anything.

165
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,022
Alright, you're safe now.

166
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,340
Here.

167
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,620
Let's go.

168
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,580
Let's go.

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

170
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,020
Cut the act.

171
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,266
You're not Skinner.

172
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,260
Even if you don't talk now,

173
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,020
we'll find out soon enough.

174
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,180
Understand this.

175
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,260
Whether you speak

176
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,860
will impact your sentencing later.

177
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:08,622
The fingerprints on the duck egg
don't match his.

178
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,900
Where's Skinner?

179
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,100
So Chen A'mo hasn't said a word?

180
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,260
Jiajia.

181
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,466
Do you have the surveillance?

182
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,660
I requested it from traffic control

183
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,020
and found only one car leaving

184
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,940
during our operation.

185
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,100
I also found this

186
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,660
and made
a map of Skinner's escape route.

187
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,820
I found him ending up

188
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,980
at the foot of Baiwushan.

to nearby police stations.

194
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,460
Okay.

195
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,860
Buddy.

196
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,820
Heading into town?

197
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,700
No, I'm heading back to the village.

198
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,580
So am I.

199
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,820
I'm visiting my aunt.

200
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,780
Give me a lift.

201
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,340
Sure, get in.

202
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,420
Thanks.

203
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:51,540
(Store)

204
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,140
What do you need?

205
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:00,100
I need to make a call.

206
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,300
Go ahead.

207
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,420
Hello?

208
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,180
Fei.

209
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,340
Gang.

210
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,620
You'd better reward me.

211
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,740
This month's business

212
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,820
is booming.

213
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,660
We're up another 20%!

214
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,180
All thanks to you.

215
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,260
Can you

216
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,620
give me a bigger bonus next month?

217
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,140
And give me a big red envelope
for the year-end bonus.

218
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,711
Boss. Skinner's operation
has been busted.

219
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,020
The place got raided.

220
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,300
What about him?

221
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,900
He got away.

222
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,933
Still want to fool around outside?

223
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,580
Yes.

224
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,660
Alright.

225
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,444
Take care of this matter for me then.

226
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,860
Remember.

227
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,580
Handle it properly.

228
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,300
Once it's done,

229
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,540
hide yourselves.

230
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
The farther, the better.

231
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,620
Okay.

232
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,260
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

233
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,380
We found it.

234
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,955
Director Deng, we found it.

235
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,329
The tech department verified

236
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,619
that the fingerprints
from the off-road vehicle at Baiwushan

237
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,710
match the ones from the salted duck egg
at the nightclub.

238
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:51,800
That person is Skinner.

239
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,020
We've identified Skinner.

240
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,420
Wang Guangqing.

241
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,060
Born November 6, 1979.

242
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,780
No social security record,

243
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:07,266
and no criminal record either?

244
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,340
(October 19)

245
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,220
(is a heartbreaking day.)

246
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,860
(To save a drowning boy
named Wang Guangqing,)

247
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,500
(Chief Chang Yongjun
of Nanyangdian Police Station)

248
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,900
(tragically drowned.)

249
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,420
(Chang Yongjun's Grave)
(He died at the age of 43.)

250
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,900
(With his life and dedication,)

251
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,660
(he vividly embodied
the responsibility and mission)

252
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:26,844
(of a police officer.)

253
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,100
(A tribute to a police hero.)

254
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,155
Isn't it ironic, Mr. Yin?

255
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,620
Since I can remember,

256
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,360
he has always wanted
to be a good policeman.

257
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,020
For the sake of work,

258
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,400
he worked day and night

259
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,620
and was never at home.

260
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,700
The person he died saving

261
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,355
turned out to be
a ruthless human trafficker.

262
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,380
Chang Rui.

263
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,180
I understand how you feel,

264
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,740
but this happened years ago.

265
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,140
Besides, you shouldn't
talk about your father like that.

266
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,900
Can you stop overthinking it?

267
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,060
He wasn't a good father.

268
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,380
Chang Rui!

269
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,111
Nor was he a good policeman.

270
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,733
He wasn't a hero either.

271
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,260
He was just a fool.

272
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,500
A big fool.

273
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:30,700
Issue this immediately.

274
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:31,780
Pursue him with full force.

275
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,740
Yes.

276
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,860
(Store)

277
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:55,111
(Wanted: Wang Guangqing)
Have you seen this man lately?

278
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,020
No.

279
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,940
Okay.

280
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,780
If you see him,

281
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,790
report to us immediately.

282
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,140
Okay.

283
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,660
Fei.

284
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,620
You're finally here.

285
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,700
Get in the back.

286
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,460
The trunk.

287
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,580
Police are here.

288
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:24,220

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,540
Hello, show us your ID.

290

292
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,020
Get out.

293
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,980
Police are here.

294
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,260
(Driver's License, Fei Yan)

295
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,460
(Police Checkpoint)

296
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,955
Everything you wanted is here.

297
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,140
Next Wednesday at 3 PM.

298
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,500
The dock.

299
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:08,733
Someone will take you away.

300
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,300
Next Wednesday?

301
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,060
That long?

302
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,540
Fei.

303
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,422
I'm wanted right now.

304
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,140
So you know you're wanted?

305
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,700
Planes are fast.

306
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,000
But would you dare take it?

307
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,060
Enough.

308
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,860
Lay low these few days.

309
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,180
Remember the time

310
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,533
and be at the dock on time.

311
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,580
Fei.

312
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,300
Isn't this a bit little?

313
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,100
This amount

314
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,980
isn't enough to buy my life.

315
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,300
Skinner.

316
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,140
Do you know how big a risk

317
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,533
I'm taking to meet you?

318
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,940
Are you even aware?

319
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,220
No matter how big the risk,

320
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,688
you had to see me anyway.

321
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,900
What then?

322
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,355
Just waiting for me to get caught?

323
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,220
Not enough?

324
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,500
Talk to Boss yourself.

325
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,140
If Boss

326
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,310
were willing to see me,

327
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,460
would I have to see you?

328
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,380
Fei.

329
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,060
If something happens to me,

330
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
we're all doomed.

331
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:31,000
What do you want then?

332
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,420
100,000 yuan

333
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,780
in cash.

334
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,480
100,000 yuan?

335
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,300
I'm afraid

336
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,800
you'll get it

337
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:47,100
but not live to spend it.

338
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,140
What do you mean?

339
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,180
So it's do-or-die?

340
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,940
We'll just go to jail together.

341
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,060
You think you'll still get fed in jail?

342
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,622
Just take the way out I gave you.

343
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,420
If you're worried about your family,

344
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,220
I'll take care of them for you.

345
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,555
Just leave when the time comes.

346
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,900
Don't come back.

347
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,740
Or no one can save you.

(Nanjie Provincial People's Hospital)

350
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,220
You're eating so little.

351
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,940
I'll peel you an apple.

352
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,740
Mom.

353
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
I'm thirsty.

354
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,088
I'll pour you some water.

355
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,460
I want a soft drink.

356
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,660
Okay.

357
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,500
I'll go buy it right now.

358
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,260
Be good.

359
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,460
Rest well.

360
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,660
I don't force people.

361
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,180
It's okay, Sweetie.

362
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,740
She's yours now.

363
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,377
- Thank you, Skinner.
- Thanks, Skinner!

364
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,900
No!

365
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,300
No!

Weiwei!

367
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,880
Don't do this!
Weiwei, give me the knife!

368
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,180
Give me the knife.

369
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,100
- Weiwei!
- Weiwei!

Don't do this, Weiwei.

372

What are you doing, Weiwei?

373
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,020
You're safe now.

374
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,500
Why hurt yourself?

375
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,460

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,300
They hope I could continue school.

384
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,940
But look at me now...

385
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,100
Everyone will laugh at me.

386
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,780
Everyone will look down on me.

387
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,540
No one will laugh at you.

388
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,620
You're not the one who did wrong.

389
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,020
No one will laugh at you.

390
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,380
Stop hurting yourself, okay?

391
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,980
What about your mom?

392
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:14,000
Weiwei!

393
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,620
Are you okay?

394
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,060
Weiwei.

395
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,820
Why would you hurt yourself?

396
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,060
Sorry, Weiwei.

397
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,460
Sorry.

398
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,660
It's all my fault.

399
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,700
I didn't protect you.

400
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,860
I won't force you
to do anything ever again.

401
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,780
If you don't want to go to school,
then don't.

402
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,780
If you want to die,

403
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,380
let me die for you, okay?

404
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,860
Don't hurt yourself
behind my back again.

405
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,700
Sweetheart.

406
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,780
Sorry...

407
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,100
Sorry...

408
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,377
Sorry...

409
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,540
Zheng Weiwei is so pitiful.

410
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,140
I wonder when we'll get

411
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,444
news about Wang Guangqing.

412
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,780
Hello?

413
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,380
Officer Yang.

414
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,700
Are you with Director Deng?

415
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:25,860
Hurry to the shelter.

416
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,400
Something happened with Pingjiao.

417
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,660
Okay. I'll be right there.

418
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,620
Alright.

419
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,620
The shelter director just called.

420
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,900
There's some issue with Pingjiao.

421
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,860
She wants us to go over.

422
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,300
What kind of issue?

423
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,660
She didn't tell me the details.

424
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,540
Let's head to the shelter.

425
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,380
Okay.

426
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,420
(Linshan City Shelter)
Register all the info.

427
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,580
Yes.

428
00:32:51,911 --> 00:32:53,200
It should be written down.

429
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,220
Director Liu.

430
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,020
What happened?

431
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,780
Director Deng.

432
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,740
You're finally here.

433
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,580
We've called Pingjiao's family
many times.

434
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,711
No one came to pick her up.

435
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,180
Her family is strange too.

436
00:33:04,488 --> 00:33:05,822
She won't speak to us either.

437
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,420
Alright, I'll take a look.

438
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,180
Pingjiao.

439
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,860
Do you remember me?

440
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,340
You haven't eaten, have you?

441
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,060
We haven't either.

442
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:26,060
Want to go out
and eat something together?

443
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,820
Director Deng.

444
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,620
Why don't you chat with Pingjiao first?

445
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,380
I'll try contacting her parents again.

446
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,900
They won't come.

447
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,100
They think I'm an embarrassment.

448
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,860
No, don't say that.

449
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,580
Pingjiao, you're not an embarrassment.

450
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,100
You were deceived.

451
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,340
We'll explain everything to your family.

452
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,660
That's not what I mean.

453
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,340
Officer.

454
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,260
If I tell you,

455
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,100
will...

456
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,940
Will you help me?

457
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,020
Of course.

458
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,500
(They've treated me badly
since I was little.)

459
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,866
(They gave me a nickname, Zhaodi.)
[*Calling for a younger brother.]

460
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,370
(I heard from the villagers)

461
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,660
(it's because they wanted a son.)

462
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,133
(They want me to bring them a boy.)

463
00:34:28,155 --> 00:34:30,260
(That's why they gave me that name.)

464
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,860
(They didn't let me go to school)

465
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,140
(and made me do chores every day.)

466
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,300
(They often beat me.)

467
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,980
(One time,)

468
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,780
(I snuck outside a classroom
to listen in,)

469
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,500
(but my father found me.)

470
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,140
(I suffered another beating.)

471
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,060
That's how I ran away.

472
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,180
I understand what you're saying.

473
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,540
Leave it to us.

474
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,540
Jiajia.

475
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,780
Contact Mr. Yin.

476
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,460
Tell him we're sending Pingjiao back.

477
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,990
We'll see what's with her parents.

478
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,540
This is the place.

479
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,500
He

480
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,980
barely leaves the village.

481
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,860
Lv Guoping.

482
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:48,844
Leaders from Linshan City Police Bureau

483
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:50,222
have some questions for you.

484
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,180
What?

485
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,500
What questions?

486
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,140
We didn't do anything wrong.

487
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
You didn't.

488
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,180
We're just bringing your daughter home.

489
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:01,755
I don't have a daughter like that.

490
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,955
She's not your daughter?
Then how did we find you?

491
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,780
She's not related to us.

492
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,860
I don't want her!

493
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,820
You don't want her?

494
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,700
She's your daughter after all.

495
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,266
How can you just say you don't want her?

496
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,620
She ran off on her own.

497
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,900
That ungrateful girl.

498
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,260
We worked very hard to raise her,

499
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:18,888
and she just left without a word.

500
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,820
How ungrateful.

501
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:22,300
You think you can run off
and just come back?

502
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,060
You've got some nerve.

503
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,540
You did shameful things outside

504
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,060
and expect me to pick you up
after you were caught?

505
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,220
Why should I?

506
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,900
You're shameless,

507
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,940
but I still want my pride!

508
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,780
Why are you yelling?

509
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,820
She wasn't arrested.

510
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:36,220
She was tricked by traffickers.

511
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,420
She suffered.

512
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,622
She's not my mom's biological daughter.

513
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,860
She's just a stray.

514
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,660
Who are you calling a stray?

515
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,220
Who are you calling a stray?

516
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,300
- What are you doing?
- Put it down.

517
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,260
What did you say?

518
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,800
Restrain him.

519
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,460
Pingjiao.

520
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,460
- Stay still!
- Calm down.

521
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,300
Put it down!

522
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,260
Calm down.

523
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,940
You hit me?

524
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,780
Lv Guoping!

525
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
You'd better explain.

526
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,620
Is Pingjiao
your biological daughter or not?

527
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,820
No, we adopted her.

528
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,460
Adopted?

529
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:11,977
Do you have the paperwork?

530
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,100
Show us.

531
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,860
Here's the thing.

532
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,100
Let me explain.

533
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,140
Back then,

534
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,220
I had a miscarriage

535
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,700
and couldn't get pregnant after that.

536
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,860
Later,

537
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,220
the village elders told us

538
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,500
that raising a girl
could help bring a son,

539
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,380
so we adopted her.

540
00:38:26,777 --> 00:38:28,020
Where did you adopt her from?

541
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,220
A distant relative.

542
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,500
What's their name?

543
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,340
Where do they live?

544
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,460
You bought me with money.

545
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,740
You're all just traffickers!

546
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,060
I just bought you!

547
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,844
I didn't steal you!
What's wrong with that?

548
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:42,860
Do you know
child trafficking is illegal?

549
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,020
Illegal?

550
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,980
How is it illegal?

551
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,060
We didn't buy her.

552
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,740
She was gifted by our relative. Gifted.

553
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
Enough.

554
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,540
Let me make this clear.

555
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,220
Buying or selling is a crime.

556
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,440
To get to the bottom of this,

557
00:38:55,444 --> 00:38:57,060
you're coming with us to the station

558
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,340
to investigate everything.

559
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:58,980
Take them away.

560
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,860
No, I have to take care
of my child! I can't go!

561
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,620
Son!

562
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,380
Son!

563
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,940
Son!

564
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,100
I won't go!

565
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,500
Don't take me away!

566
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,820
It's okay.

567
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,860
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

568
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,460
Director.

569
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,220
The DNA test results are in.

570
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,180
Pingjiao
isn't their biological daughter.

571
00:39:28,377 --> 00:39:29,940
Her adoptive parents also confessed.

572
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,260
A cripple

573
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,100
sold her to them.

574
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,340
A cripple again?

575
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,380
Over a decade ago,

576
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,620
child trafficking was at its peak.

577
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,820
Yan Lei, watch that area.

578
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,860
Jiajia, check the database

579
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,220
for a DNA match for Pingjiao.

580
00:39:45,022 --> 00:39:46,550
A village on Mangshan's north slope

581
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,200
lost a child in 1998.

582
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,500
And that child's DNA

583
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,860
is an exact match for Pingjiao's.

584
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,580
You'll be seeing
your biological parents very soon.

585
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,460
(Police)

586
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,380
Director Deng, this is Lin Village.

587
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,620
This is the village chief, Bai.

588
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:00,022
Hello, Director Deng.

589
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,220
Hello.

590
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,500
This is Bai Xiujing.

591
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,860
Bai Shengquan's daughter.

592
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:05,980
Bai Xiujing's home is over there.

593
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,220
I'll take you there.

594
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:09,580
Just turn the corner up ahead.

595
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,700
Alright.

596
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,580
It's right there.

597
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,333
Look,
it's where three people are standing.

598
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,700
- Bai Shengquan.
- Hurry!

599
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,820
Your daughter is back!

600
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,030
Your daughter is back.

601
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,670
Director Deng, this is Xiujing's father.

602
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,460
Bai Shengquan.

603
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,980
This is your daughter.

604
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,460
She's home.

605
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,180
Jing.

606
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,580
You've grown so tall.

607
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,460
Dad...

608
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,580
Dad...

609
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,160
I'm your dad.

610
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,660
I'm your dad.

611
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,200
It's good you're back.

612
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,010
It's good you're back.

613
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:47,660
It's good you're back.

614
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,860
All these years,

615
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,620
your dad looked so hard for you.

616
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,340
You were missing for years.

617
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,860
We searched many times.

618
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,180
You're all grown up.

619
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,420
Poor child.

620
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,620
It's good you're home.

621
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,400
Dad...

622
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,180
Officers...

623
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,020
Officers.

624
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,180
You came just in time.

625
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,020
Save my daughter, okay?

626
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,380
Madam.

627
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:23,900
Hurry.

628
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,420
Help me find my daughter!

629
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,100
Honey, calm down!

630
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,940
Calm down!

631
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,180
She was kidnapped.

632
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,140
Right over there.

633
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,660
I...

634
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,860
She's my mom?

635
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,580
I'm begging you!

636
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,180
I...

637
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:33,700
Honey.

638
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,220
Honey, calm down.

639
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,660
I'm telling you.

640
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,780
She's only seven and a half.

641
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,060
Right here.

642
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,700
I...

643
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,860
I just turned around.

644
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:42,980
When I turned back around,

645
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,140
someone took her!

646
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,780
I... You...

647
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,900
You...

648
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,780
Did you see my daughter?

649
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,380
Did you see my daughter?

650
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,340
She was wearing a little red vest.

651
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,100
Mom, I'm Jing. Mom!

652
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,140
Madam.

653
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,980
Calm down!

654
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,180
Calm down.

655
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,260
