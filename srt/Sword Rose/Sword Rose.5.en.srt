2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,940
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,030
Madam, you've lived here a long time.

4
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,790
Have you seen any young girls
from out of town lately?

5
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,560
Yes, there's one.

6
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,870
Do you know where she is now?

7
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,044
She's at Mr. Mo's house.

8
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,120
I think it's on the east side of town.

9
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,822
Not sure whose house exactly.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you looking for her?

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,310
Right...

12
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,040
Is the Mo family

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
trying to find a match
for their daughter?

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,190
What? It's not a daughter.

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,270
They have a son.

16
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,800
Right, my mistake.

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,590
It's a son.

18
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,080
So, does their son have a girlfriend?

19
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,470
Are you trying to find a match
for Mr. Mo's boy?

20
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,390
Yes.

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,670
He's a good young man.

22
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,560
He's their

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
only child.

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,320
Honest and sincere.

25
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,920
Good-natured too.

26
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,800
They are one of the wealthiest families

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,440
on this street.

28
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,800
Really? Then he must
already have a girlfriend

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,710
since he's so kind and well-off.

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,600
Do they have a daughter-in-law?

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,990
You're mistaken.

32
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,990
There is a girl in their house.

33
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,150
But that girl

34
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,160
is mute.

35
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,080
A distant relative of theirs.

36
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,710
Poor girl, really.

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,880
A few days ago,

38
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,440
some people came looking for trouble.

39
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,560
So the Mo family

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,510
took her in out of kindness.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,910
You can go to the west end
of this street.

42
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,870
That's where they live.

43
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,790
Go take a look.

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,120
They live on the west side
of town, right?

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,040
Yes.

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,520
How much?

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
Thirty-six yuan.

48
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,830
Here's 40. Keep the change.

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,280
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,800
Thank you.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,310
Come again.

52
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,960
Sure.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,310
Thanks.

54
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,230
Take care now.

55
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,080
So, is it settled?

56
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,350
It's done.

57
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,070
Thanks.

58
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:28,520
To solve the problem,

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,550
I should take some money.

60
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,630
Get in the car first.

61
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,270
Pleasure doing business.

62
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,510
Nice job on the mission.

63
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:58,488
You've spent all your money,
haven't you?

64
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,790
What else could I do?

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,120
The mission comes first.

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,133
Especially when it comes straight
from Director.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,880
Hello, Mom?

68
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,550
We found Little Spud's location.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,160
Really?

70
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,400
That's great!

71
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,750
Is the child okay?

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,670
Get to the point.

73
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,480
But they want 200,000
before they tell us

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,880
exactly where Little Spud is.

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,680
Two hundred thousand?

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,640
That much?

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,670
I'll talk to Mom.

78
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,390
Mom.

79
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,120
Lin Hao and I only have 20,000 in cash.

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,950
My parents don't have any
spare money either...

81
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,870
Let me talk...

82
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,430
Mom.

83
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,910
Can you think of a way
to raise the money?

84
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,430
Xin and I

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
don't have much

86
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
savings on hand.

87
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,600
I'll raise the money.

88
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:55,480
If we give them the money,

89
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,590
will we be able to see
the child right away?

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,510
What if they're scammers?

91
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,390
What?

92
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,030
Mom asked if they might be scammers.

93
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,430
No, Mom, they're not.

94
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,630
We have a photo.

95
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,800
Quick, send it to Mom.

96
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
I'll have Lin Hao send it to you.

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
We've seen the picture.

98
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,080
And we asked around town.

99
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,680
Someone saw Little Spud.

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,350
Mom, it can't be fake.

101
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,040
I'll raise the money.

102
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,070
I'll go ask our relatives
for a loan right now.

103
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,990
Mom.

104
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,270
Mom, you can't ask the relatives.

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,590
They warned us over and over again.

106
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560
They took a big risk to tip us off.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,680
You absolutely can't tell
relatives or friends...

108
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,920
Mom.

109
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,822
Too many people talking

110
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,710
could put Little Spud in danger.

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,200
Don't tell anyone.

112
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,160
Yeah, Mom, if the police find out,

113
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,880
you might never see Little Spud again.

114
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,800
Okay, I get it.

115
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,470
Don't worry, you two.

116
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,950
I won't say a word to anyone.

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,320
I'll find a way myself.

118
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,000
You have to listen to us on this.

119
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,350
I will.

120
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,510
Alright, I'm hanging up now.

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,280
Xin...

122
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,680
We finally found him...

123
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,380
(Mo's Grocery)

124
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,080
Hello, we're from the
Linshan City Police Bureau.

125
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,790
Officers,

126
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,150
can I help you?

127
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,590
We heard there was
a mute girl here recently. Is that true?

128
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,480
Yes.

129
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,710
A relative stayed here for a few days.

130
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,750
She has already left.

131
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
A distant relative?

132
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,360
Yes.

133
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,160
She already left?

134
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,640
Yes, she's from my wife's side
of the family.

135
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:44,240
Said it's too poor up in the mountains,

136
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,950
so she wanted to find a job.

137
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,720
But how can a mute find a job?

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,830
So she couldn't find one.

139
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,440
My wife sent her back.

140
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,640
Mind if we take a look inside?

141
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:53,640
Not at all. Come in.

142
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,270
What's the mute girl's name?

143
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,560
She's a distant relative
from my wife's side,

144
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,120
barely even related.

145
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,040
Not very close.

146
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
I didn't ask carefully.

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I honestly don't know.

148
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,870
And this is?

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,830
This is my son,

150
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,600
Mo Lin.

151
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,520
Say hello to them!

152
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,320
Why are you being so rude?

153
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,510
Go back to your room.

154
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,430
Stop playing.

155
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,560
Officers,

156
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,488
please don't mind him.

157
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:17,470
He's just spoiled.

158
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:20,150
There's definitely something off
about that father and son.

159
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,000
We need to find the mute girl.

160
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,711
She's the key to cracking the case.

161
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,390
I'll go ask around again.

162
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,510
If you go now, you'll tip them off.

163
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Alright.

164
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,466
I'll get someone to watch them.

165
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,040
Hello, Yan Lei?

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
Xiaoxing.

167
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,350
What are you drawing?

168
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,640
I was just thinking what Xiaoyu
must look like now.

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,350
Maybe he looks a bit like me?

170
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,950
But I've changed so much
since I was little,

171
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,590
so he must've changed too.

172
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,870
I want to draw him out,

173
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,280
but my mind's just a blur.

174
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,310
Xiaoxing,

175
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,000
you know,

176
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
I think about Xiaoguang a lot too.

177
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,800
By age,

178
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,590
he should be in middle school now.

179
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,520
Probably grown taller.

180
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,280
When he was little,

181
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,230
he had really big eyes.

182
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,080
Guess if his nose is like mine,

183
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,280
or like his mom's?

184
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,080
He probably looks like his mom.

185
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,560
Listening to the two of you talk
just now,

186
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,040
it got me thinking.

187
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,800
What does Ranran look like

188
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,080
now that she's grown up?

189
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,440
She's probably about the same height
as Yanyan.

190
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,350
But chubbier than Yan.

191
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,550
When she was little,

192
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,080
she loved to eat.

193
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,230
Her cheeks were all chubby.

194
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,350
She had a little mole on her nose.

195
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,000
I wonder if it's still there
now that she's grown.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,950
It probably is.

197
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,560
After all these years,

198
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,630
this is the only photo I have.

199
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,590
Nothing else at all.

200
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,590
I keep thinking,

201
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,600
if one day

202
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,160
Xiaoyu really stood in front of me,

203
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,590
would I still recognize him?

204
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,430
You would.

205
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,750
Definitely.

206
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,320
Didn't Xiaosu say the other day,

207
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,470
that a famous professor said

208
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,350
that family members

209
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,440
have a kind of psychic connection?

210
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,350
I believe that.

211
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,640
Me too.

216
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,630
Ma'am,

217
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,320
your house may be a bit old,

218
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,511
but it's about to become a new
school zone property.

219
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,110
I heard a top school is opening
a branch nearby.

220
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,910
You'd better think carefully
before selling.

221
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,470
This was a company-issued apartment,

222
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,950
and no one is living in it anymore.

223
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,560
We need money, so let's just sell it.

224
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,200
Let me explain again,

225
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,270
it's about to become
a school zone property.

226
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,466
It'll be in high demand.

227
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,510
If it's in demand,

228
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,270
then please help me sell it fast.

229
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,190
The sooner, the better.

230
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,111
How soon are you thinking?

231
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,030
Ideally, I'd like the money today.

232
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,550
Cash, full payment.

233
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,560
Well, in that case, the price might...

234
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm willing to take a loss.

235
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,710
Can you sell it?

236
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,280
There are some people
who've shown interest.

237
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,270
Give me a second.

238
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,710
I'll make a few calls right now.

are you asking for?

242
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,440
Alright, hold on.

I have a buyer
ready to sign immediately,

by another 20,000.

246
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,080
So...

247
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,000
Sure.

248
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,590

255
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,040
I feel uneasy about something.

I want to talk it through with you.

257

Here's the money. Take a look.

258
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,200
I think,

259
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,630
since we haven't seen the child yet,

260
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,870
maybe we should play it safe
and give them half first.

261
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,120
What do you think?

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,550
Okay.

263
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,510
That's safer.

264
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,430
Alright.

265
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,510
Wait here a moment.

266
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,822
I'll go give him the money.

267
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:19,622
Okay.

270

but the other side
is asking for 200,000.

271
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,920
We can only see the child after paying.

272
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,670
Mrs. Lin, no,

273
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,910
it's a scam!

274
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,260
Please don't believe them.
We haven't found Little Spud yet.

275
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,520
That's what I was thinking too.

276
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,590
I thought the same as you.

277
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,950
That's why I called you.

278

But I already transferred the money
to Lin Hao.

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,550
What now?

280
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,680

288
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,120

00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,630

292
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
don't rush just yet.

293
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,600
I'll call Lin Hao.

294
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,560

309

314

315
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,840

What for?

323
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,800
If we wait, it'll be too late.

324

325
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,800
Wait here a second, sweetie.

326
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,360
She's gone.

327
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,910

Try running again, huh?

363
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,950
I dare you to run!

366
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,870
Open the door!

367
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,110

375
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,510
Open the door!

376
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,430
Did you hear me?

377
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,800
Honey, go!

378
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,390
Run!

379
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,280
Hide! Quickly!

380
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,560
Xiaobao!

381
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,560
Hurry, Honey!

382
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,120
Chase them!

383
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,360
They took our child!

384
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,990
Stop!

385
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,120
Stop!

386
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,230
That way!

387
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,830
Hello?

388
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,110
Director Deng, something happened.

389
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:05,590
Lin Hao and Cai Xin snatched a child.

390
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,130
They just passed Linshan North Station.

391
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:07,920
What?

392
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,320
Okay, got it.

393
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,430
Alright, I'm on my way.

394
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,644
Turn around and head to
Linshan North Station.

395
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,150
Stop right there!

396
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,270
Don't come closer!

397
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,960
Stop!

398
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,880
Don't come any closer!

399
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,440
Put the child down.

400
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,360
Stay back!

401
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,000
One more step

402
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,920
and I'll jump!

403
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,390
Don't provoke her...

404
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,390
No one's taking my child away from me!

405
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,880
Listen to me.

406
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,400
Put my child down first.

407
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,070
This is not your child! It's my child!

408
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,310
- You're right! Stay here!
- Xiaobao!

409
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,110
Don't provoke her!

410
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,630
Xiaobao, come to Mommy!

411
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,240
If you upset her,

412
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,390
what if she really jumps?

413
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,279
(The situation is dangerous.
Onlookers are on edge.)

414
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,820
(Daylight child snatching and rooftop
standoff. Is she mentally unstable?)

415
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,040
Director, has Cai Xin really gone mad?

416
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,920
She hasn't.

417
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,022
Any parent who's been through this
would act the same.

418
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,320
One more step and I'll jump!

419
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,280
They took my child!

420
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,280
They're bad people!

421
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:22,920
Officers!

422
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,570
What's going on?

423
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:24,440
She took my child!

424
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,030
Honey...

425
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,480
Officers!

426
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,550
It's them!

427
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,510
They kidnapped my child!

428
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,270
That's my child!

429
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,830
Shut up!

430
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,790
That's my child!

431
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,030
Is it really your child?

432
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,950
No!

433
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,311
See? See? They admitted it themselves.

434
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:37,177
They're traffickers!

435
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:38,270
Arrest them right now.

436
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,520
Arrest them!

437
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:40,200
Calm down.

438
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,560
They're traffickers!

439
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,640
Calm down.

440
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,480
What are you doing?

441
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,600
Stay back!

442
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,320
Don't come closer!

443
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:55,777
Honey!

444
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,680
Director, you're here!

445
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,590
They're up there.

446
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,480
Come with me.

447
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,400
Let's go.

448
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,920
Honey.

449
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:10,200
Honey, be careful. Don't panic.

450
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,150
Be careful.

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
- What's the situation?
- Director.

452
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,110
The woman is extremely agitated.

453
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,190
Director...

454
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,830
My wife is extremely emotional
right now.

455
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,750
Can you talk to her?

456
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,760
Okay, leave it to me.

457
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,390
Are they the child's parents?

458
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:23,510
They're not the parents...

459
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,430
Cai Xin.

460
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,560
It's me,

461
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,710
Deng Yan.

462
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,190
Do you remember me?

463
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,230
Director Deng...

464
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,870
You're here!

465
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,430
Arrest them all!

466
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:35,510
They're all traffickers!

467
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,350
They're all scammers!

468
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,070
Shut up! Who are you calling
a trafficker?

469
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,240
I recorded it.
They admitted it themselves.

470
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,350
Alright, take them away.

471
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:43,550
Give me back my child.

472
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,910
Why are you dragging me?

473
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,280
It's my child! Why are you dragging me?

474
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,230
Cai Xin.

475
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,830
They're gone now.

476
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,666
No one's taking Little Spud
from you anymore.

477
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:53,800
Trust me, okay?

478
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,190
Cai Xin.

479
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,520
We didn't find Little Spud in time.

481
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,960
You found him all by yourself.

482
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
You really are connected by heart.

483
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,720
It was our failure.

484
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,200
You heard Little Spud calling out
to you, didn't you?

485
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,670
Yes.

486
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:18,760
He has a mole on his back?

487
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,950
Yes.

488
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,110
I saw it.

489
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,480
It's in the exact same spot.

490
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,400
Alright.

491
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,480
Don't take another step.

492
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,670
If you take another step,

493
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,190
Little Spud could be in danger.

494
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,040
Think about how long it's been

495
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,830
since Little Spud saw his mom.

496
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,160
He's really sad.

497
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,790
If you take one more step

498
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,870
with him in your arms,

499
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,244
the consequences would be unthinkable.

500
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,870
Think of the child.

501
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,670
He must be so scared,

502
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,110
right?

503
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,030
Yeah.

504
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,350
I can't take another step.

505
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,120
He's scared.

506
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,920
Honey.

507
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,790
Look.

508
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,950
Why isn't he making a sound?

509
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,070
He stopped crying.

510
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,960
Why did he stop crying?

511
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,880
Is he hungry?

512
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,920
Let me see him.

513
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,270
Yeah.

514
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,720
He hasn't cried for a while.

515
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,840
Let me see him.

516
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,120
Trust me.

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,040
He is your Little Spud.

518
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,830
No one can take him away from you.

519
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,590
Cai Xin...

520
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,720
Okay, you can take a look.

521
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,710
Just one look,
and then I'll give him back to you.

522
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:09,470
Okay?

523
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,880
Let me see him.

524
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,030
Little Spud.

525
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,000
Look at him. He must have been scared.

526
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,630
What's wrong, Little Spud?

527
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,390
It really is Little Spud.

528
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,800
They took him away.

529
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,240
Is he crying?

530
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,350
He keeps looking at his mom.

531
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,510
The baby's crying.

532
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,920
The baby's crying.

533
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,470
Why is he crying?

534
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:29,790
Take the child for DNA testing.

535
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,830
She took him away.

536
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,520
She took my child away!

537
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,160
She took my child away!

538
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,550
Why are you dragging me?

539
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,640
Why did he stop crying?

540
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,488
The child's safe now.

541
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,155
It's okay, Honey.

542
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,240
Officer,

543
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,160
we've seen the photos.

544
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,444
It really is our child. It really is!

545
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,750
We had the child

546
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,720
take a DNA test.

547
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,520
He's not Little Spud.

548
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,430
That's impossible.

549
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,910
You must've made a mistake.

550
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,590
You were tricked.

551
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,310
These people used
your missing child poster

552
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,240
and platform listings

553
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,240
to learn everything about Little Spud.

554
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:07,800
Then they found a similar-looking child

555
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:09,480
just to scam you out of your money.

556
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,510
During that time,

557
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,960
the people who gave you tips,

558
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,560
who guided you,

559
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,760
even strangers
you asked for directions...

560
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,430
They were all impostors.

561
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,630
We were scammed...

562
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,480
It was all a scam.

563
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,600
But don't worry,

564
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:29,160
the Wang brothers who scammed you
have been caught.

565
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,150
But they've already transferred
the money to Zhao Zhilong.

566
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,430
We haven't found Zhao Zhilong yet.

567
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,670
How much money did you give them?

568
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,040
Two hundred thousand...

569
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,110
Don't worry

570
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,240
about the money for now.

571
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,310
Our criminal investigation team

572
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,520
will speak to you shortly.

573
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:57,310
- We don't mind spending money.
- Xin...

574
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,200
I'd pay two million if I had to.

575
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:00,270
We don't mind the cost.

576
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,110
Xin...

577
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,790
It's okay.

578
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,590
No matter the cost,

579
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,670
we'll find our child.

580
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,830
We'll get our child back.

581
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,070
Director.

582
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,990
Please stay calm.

583
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,640
Mrs. Lin is here.

584
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,470
Mom.

585
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,310
What's going on?

586
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,760
Why did you bring me here?

587
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,000
Didn't you say the child was found?

588
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,230
Please have a seat.

589
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,560
Where's Little Spud?

590
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,910
It's all my fault, Mom.

591
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,030
Hao...

592
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,440
It's my fault.

593
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,360
Xin.

594
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,000
Say something, where's the child?

595
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,430
Where's the child?

596
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,120
Yanyan,

597
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,600
what happened?

598
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,830
Didn't I beg you to go find them?

599
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:43,444
Why didn't you bring the child back?

600
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,040
Where's the child?

601
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,950
Mom...

602
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,360
Mom...

603
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,240
We were scammed.

604
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,280
That child

605
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,480
isn't Little Spud.

606
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,750
Mom...

607
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,590
Mom...

608
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,910
This is my fault. I was too desperate.

609
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,880
It's all my fault.

610
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,350
I was just too anxious.

611
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,110
Mom, I was too desperate.

612
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,030
Mom...

613
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,040
I really thought

614
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,870
we'd found Little Spud,

615
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,320
that our child was finally coming home,

616
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,190
that we could finally be reunited
as a family.

617
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,960
How could this happen?

618
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,480
How could this happen...

619
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
It's all my fault.

620
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,320
Mom...

621
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,720
I ruined

622
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,270
our happy family.

623
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,400
I've let you all down.

624
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,560
I've let Little Spud down.

625
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm the sinner in this family.

626
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,870
Mom...

627
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,350
I'm so sorry...

628
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:01,488
We've lost the lead
on Little Spud again.

629
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,400
Even after working
in this office for so long,

630
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,044
I'm still not used to it.

631
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,320
That poor family

632
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,190
was utterly devastated.

633
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,044
Completely heartbroken.

634
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,910
I just want to help them somehow.

635
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,910
But now the leads are a complete mess.

636
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,680
If only

637
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,270
we had an integrated database.

638
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,830
It would boost our efficiency so much.

639
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,230
What's that?

640
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,080
Let me explain simply.

641
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,640
It's like building a space on a server

642
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,160
where we can upload everything,

643
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,430
all the case files, data,
and info from our unit.

644
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,790
Then with a simple keyword,

645
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,960
we can instantly search

646
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,044
for all the clues and info we need.

647
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,720
Is that complicated?

648
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,840
It'll take some time.

649
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,200
Can you handle it?

650
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,110
Of course I can.

651
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,377
I'll show you when it's done.

652
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,560
Director Deng,

653
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,600
we've confirmed it.

654
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,430
The child isn't Yao Laosan's.

655
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,320
They adopted him through legal means.

656
00:28:19,622 --> 00:28:21,244
And the paperwork is all in order.

657
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,520
So that's good news, at least.

658
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Otherwise, if the child's future
were uncertain,

659
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
everyone would still be on edge.

660
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,800
Alright, get some rest.

661
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,800
How can I not be worried?

662
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,630
Did you see the footage?

663
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:44,066
The family's so desperate
they're ready to jump.

664
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,550
Okay.

665
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,280
Let me know the moment
you hear anything.

666
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,800
Hello?

667
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,990
Deng Yan,

668
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,800
we just got a report at the station.

669
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,133
Mr. Yin collapsed by the roadside.

670
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,110
How could that be?

671
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,720
He seemed fine when he left.

672
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,520
What happened? Is he hurt?

673
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,680
If you want to know if he's hurt,

674
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,800
go see him yourself.

675
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,160
Deng Yan,

676
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,720
let me remind you. You just
joined Anti-abduction Office.

677
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,080
I understand your eagerness
to prove yourself.

678
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,280
But fitting into a team

679
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
takes time.

680
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,600
Take it step by step.

681
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,750
Show concern for your colleagues
in every way.

682
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,480
Only then

683
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,240
can you truly be one of the team.

684
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,510
Didn't I say

685
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,590
go all in and do your best?

686
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,320
Chief Xiao and I will support you fully.

687
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,510
Alright?

688
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,900
Show more care for your colleagues.

689
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,350
Alright.

690
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,270
I understand.

691
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,933
Thanks for letting me know, Captain Han.

692
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,120
Okay.

693
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,500
(Yin Jiansheng)

694
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,470
Mr. Yin.

695
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,070
Hello.

696
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,070
Excuse me,

697
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,560
is Bed 38 Yin Jiansheng?

698
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,800
He doesn't seem to be there.

699
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,470
Yes, that's him.

700
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,000
But he said he had something at home

701
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,888
and asked to go back.
He'll be back later.

702
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,080
Hey,

703
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,590
capture the horse.

704
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,440
Where are you going with that?

705
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,350
Wrong move.

706
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,190
Why'd you do that?

707
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:55,688
Now he's going to capture your piece.

708
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:56,760
Too late now.

709
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,840
Exactly, look.

710
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,080
Your piece is right here.

711
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,480
Move your piece forward.

712
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,040
I can move it.

713
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,920
Move it then.

714
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,110
Look at him, just plays and walks off.

715
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,110
Sir,

716
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,030
still playing chess?

717
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,000
Deng.

718
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,920
What brings you here?

719
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,670
Just wanted to chat
and open up with you.

720
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,240
Sure, sure.

721
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,800
So,

722
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,800
not going too well lately?

723
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:18,549
As expected of a former director,

724
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,470
sharp as ever.

725
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,190
Actually,

726
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,760
I just wanted to share
what's on my mind.

727
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,480
Since starting work here
in Anti-abduction Office,

728
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,440
I've realized

729
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,350
it's nothing like

730
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,280
what I imagined.

731
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,480
The operations

732
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,400
and the cases

733
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,520
are way more complicated than I thought.

734
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,880
What's wrong?

735
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,800
Feeling the pressure?

736
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,350
The Party Committee and Chief Xiao

737
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,670
chose you as Director

738
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,240
because they value your character

739
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:46,822
and leadership.

740
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,080
I heard Jiansheng was hospitalized.

741
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,622
So you're short-staffed, right?

742
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,470
That's true.

743
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,400
You're here.

744
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,870
What are you secretly up to?

745
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,240
I tried to bring you food,

746
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,160
but you refused.

747
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,070
Now I come,

748
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,310
and the nurse tells me
you've been doing nothing

749
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,430
but secretly making calls.

750
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,270
I didn't know

751
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,390
you had so many friends.

752
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:15,155
Where were you sneaking off to?

753
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,550
I was bored,

754
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,470
so I went for a walk.

755
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,560
You'd better keep an eye
on your husband.

756
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:23,400
Before you know it,
he's off solving a case.

757
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,800
If something happens,
who's going to be responsible for it?

758
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,160
(Him? I know.)

759
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,240
It's the same old story.

760
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:31,955
If we're talking about Jiansheng,

761
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,222
he's top-notch in both
character and ability.

762
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,630
They don't call him the
Walking Encyclopedia for nothing.

763
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,520
Pick up any file at random
and flip to a page,

764
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,910
and he can probably
tell you all about it.

765
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
Cases, always cases.

766
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,070
That's all you care about, isn't it,

767
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,030
Yin Jiansheng,
you don't think about yourself,

768
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,600
but could you at least think about me?

769
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,080
Hello?

770
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,230
Okay.

771
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,190
Why are you yelling?

772
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,066
Aren't you worried people will laugh?

773
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,230
Let them laugh.

774
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,190
Now, where are you going?

775
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Actually...

776
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,560
Considering Mr. Yin's age
and experience,

777
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,800
after you stepped down as Director,

778
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,310
he really should've taken over the role,

779
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,230
not me.

780
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,560
Jiansheng is a retired soldier.

781
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,160
He only has a high school education.

782
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,350
I've told him many times

783
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,630
that even if he's self-taught, he needs
to get a college diploma.

784
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,920
But he single-mindedly

785
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,390
focused on solving cases
and finding missing children.

786
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,190
But nowadays, cadre appointments
emphasize education and youth.

787
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,960
Just on that point alone,

788
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,560
he doesn't qualify.

789
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,190
Anti-abduction work

790
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,800
isn't something that can be done
in a day or two.

791
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,870
Before you joined the Anti-abduction
Office, you used to ask me often

792
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,950
about Lin Ran.

793
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,640
You know this.

794
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,870
In the early years,
there were few leads,

795
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:54,590
the environment was complex,

796
00:33:54,844 --> 00:33:56,280
and the technology was crude.

797
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,520
Finding someone was extremely difficult.

798
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,750
And also,

799
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,870
buyers had little legal awareness.

800
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,430
Their ignorance

801
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,280
allowed this market
to continue circulating.

802
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,710
That's why we anti-abduction officers
need to have

803
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,710
strong willpower.

804
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,750
Never give up, or abandon hope.

805
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,666
In that regard, you've done very well.

806
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,280
Deng,

807
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,360
let me tell you,

808
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,560
Jiansheng can't sit still

809
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,040
in the hospital.

810
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,360
Let him rest a few days,
and then call him back.

811
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,911
Once he has a case to work on,

812
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,670
he'll recover faster.

813
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,590
I understand,

814
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,510
Sir.

815
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,230
Let me play chess with you.

816
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,230
Come on then.

817
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,150
Let's go.

818
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,260
(Nurse Station)

819
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,940
(Please Keep Quiet)

820
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,860
(Yin Jiansheng)

821
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,590
Hello,

822
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,510
Officer Du.

823
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,710
I'd like to ask a favor.

824
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,150
It's about the recent case,

825
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,560
the Little Spud case.

826
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,760
Yes.

827
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,670
Bed 38, turn off your phone
and get some rest.

828
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,840
Don't you know the state
of your own health?

829
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:05,940
If you keep pushing like this,
you'll have a stroke.

830
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,030
Okay, I got it.

831
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,630
Go to sleep.

832
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,150
Okay.

833
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,070
Right away.

834
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,430
Yes, yes.

835
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,070
I...

836
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,630
I'll come find you in person.

837
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:22,990
What are you doing here?

838
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,320
Hello.

839
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,555
May I know if there's a patient
with the surname Yin?

840
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,030
Yes.

841
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,950
Bed 38.

842
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,280
Thirty-eight...

843
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,070
Thank you.

844
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,590
Wait,

845
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,800
you can't go in.

846
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,150
Visiting hours are over.

847
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,840
Yes.

848
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,800
I know.

849
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,880
But the patient named Yin
is a police officer.

850
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,670
So I'd like to check in on him.

851
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,590
Still no.

852
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,120
Why not?

853
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,630
Visiting hours are over.

854
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,400
Everyone's resting.

855
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,320
Come back tomorrow.

856
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,320
So strict.

857
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,150
Move along.

858
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,110
No flexibility at all.

859
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,400
Go on.

860
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,470
Mr. Yin.

861
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,955
The nurse didn't kick you out?

862
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,150
I dropped your name,
and who'd dare kick me out?

863
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,190
Here,

864
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,110
flowers.

865
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,960
I was going to bring you some fruit,

866
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,022
but then I remembered you have diabetes,
so I got flowers instead.

867
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,150
How's recovery going?

868
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,150
I'm fine. Just need
a couple of days' rest.

869
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,670
How's the team doing lately?

870
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,020
(Linshan People's Hospital.
Please Keep Quiet.)

871
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:47,310
Okay, I'm heading over now.

872
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,300
(Baby Missing)

873
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,630
How's the Little Spud case going?

874
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,080
Any new leads?

875
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,920
Nothing yet.

876
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,190
But

877
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,920
Jiajia is working on
some kind of database.

878
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,840
She says it might help.

879
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,960
Still awake, Mr. Yin?

880
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,880
Director Deng.

881
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:31,040
What brings you here so late?

882
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,760
Actually, I came during the day.

883
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,840
You weren't here,
so I came back tonight.

884
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,200
Hope I didn't disturb your rest.

885
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,510
You're too polite.

886
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,960
I'll just leave this here for you.

887
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,880
Have a seat.

888
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:43,760
Alright, alright.

889
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,680
You can come out now.

890
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:49,190
What a coincidence, Director Deng.

891
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,240
You see...

892
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,110
I was afraid of the nurse...

893
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,360
No, not the nurse.

894
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
I was afraid of breaking hospital rules.

895
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,800
You two talk,

896
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,720
pretend I'm not here.

897
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,760
Mr. Yin,

898
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,400
didn't Captain Han tell you

899
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,630
to rest properly?

900
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,630
If we all listened to doctors,

901
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,590
the Police Bureau

902
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,230
would've filled every hospital by now.

903
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,080
This little ailment of mine is nothing.

904
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:19,022
It can't be cured, but it won't kill me.

905
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,520
The former director really called it.

906
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,360
What did he say?

907
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,320
He said if you were still awake
this late,

908
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,790
you must be working a case.

909
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,280
He guessed right.

910
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,070
Well, in that case,

911
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,110
let's talk.

912
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,920
Let's talk about the Little Spud case.

913
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,000
What's the situation now?

914
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,880
Mr. Yin, let's not talk tonight.

915
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,310
We can talk tomorrow.

916
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,790
What matters most now
is that you rest well.

917
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,933
The Anti-abduction Office needs you.

918
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,220
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

919
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,440
What's going on with Mr. Yin exactly?

920
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,720
What else could it be?

921
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,230
He's been doing this for years.

922
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,960
He can't sit still.

923
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,488
Even if he can't sit still, he has to.

924
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,360
Han Liang, you tell him

925
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:03,230
this time he must listen to the doctor.

926
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,040
He needs to rest and recover properly.

927
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,070
Chief Xiao,

928
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,000
he's worried about the Little Spud case.

929
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,880
There are no leads at all right now.

930
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,520
Unless we find Little Spud,

931
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,760
he won't get better.

932
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,440
So push ahead with the case.

933
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,230
You're the team captain.

934
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,190
You're in charge!

935
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,110
No, Chief Xiao...

936
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,720
Chief Xiao, Captain Han.
You were looking for me?

937
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:26,880
Come here.

938
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:27,630
Quickly.

939
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,550
Here, have a seat.

940
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,630
The Little Spud case

941
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,200
has gotten a lot of public attention.

942
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,920
What are your thoughts?

943
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,200
Here's how I see it.

944
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,711
There has been a recent surge
in child trafficking cases.

945
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:51,630
The Little Spud case

946
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,440
has drawn widespread attention
from society.

947
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,400
I believe

948
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,670
this is a great opportunity
to mobilize the public

949
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,960
to fight abductions.

950
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,630
It can help every household

951
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,190
realize how serious child abduction is.

952
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,920
And with our firm crackdown,

953
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,190
we can definitely curb these crimes.

954
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,240
Good.

955
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,000
From the masses,

956
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,310
to the masses.

957
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,920
That's how our Party

958
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,110
continues to thrive and stay relevant.

959
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,400
Deng,

960
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,080
that level of awareness is excellent.

961
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,270
So I'm assigning this task to you.

962
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,720
What's your plan?

963
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,666
The bureau will fully support you.

964
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,400
Understood, Chief Xiao.

966
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,840

(We got into an argument
over something trivial.)

977
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,670
(he took my child and ran off.)

978
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,880
(I ran after them, crying.)

980
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,440

the time to speak with us)

(shared with us many tactics
used by traffickers.)

984
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,630
(Their tricks are endless
and impossible to guard against.)

985
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,150
(Once it happens,
it's an immense tragedy)

986
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,790
(for any family.)

987

(If an abduction occurs,)

989
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:21,960
(first and foremost, don't panic.)

990
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,230
(Report it to the police immediately.)

991
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,760
(And try your best to remember)

992
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,590

(the vehicle used,
and the escape route.)

994
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,230
(That will help our officers)

995
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,440
(track down the suspect quickly.)

996
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,590

997

(Please trust the police.)

1000
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,040
(We hope every lost child
will return home soon,)

1001
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,520
(and that every family will be reunited.)

1002
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:48,520
(May the day come when no child
is ever abducted.)

1003
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,560
(Yes, a world without abduction.)

1004
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,777
(That requires)

1005
00:41:51,822 --> 00:41:53,630
(joint efforts from both police
and society.)

1006
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,733

Professor Yang is the best
sketch artist in Linshan.

1019
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,670
So I thought

1020
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,190
maybe he could sketch

1021
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,480
a portrait of a boy
based on your features.

00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,710
Who knows,

1023
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,150
it might be what your brother
looks like grown up.

1024
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,360
It's done.

1025
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,430
Thank you.

Is this the database you mentioned?

1030
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,760
