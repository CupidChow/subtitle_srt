4
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,440
Mr. Wu.

5
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,440
Mr. Wu.

6
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,040
Don't sleep. Have another drink.

7
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Mr. Wu, phone call.

8
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
Call for you, Mr. Wu.

9
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,050
Tell that person...

10
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
that I'm drinking.

11
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
We'll talk tomorrow.

12
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,460
Got it.

13
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,320
Drink up.

14
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
Hello.

15
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
Mr. Wu is drinking.

16
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Talk tomorrow.

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,520
Please let Mr. Wu take the call.

18
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
It's urgent.

19
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,520
It's a woman.

20
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
It's a woman.

21
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,680
Hello.

22
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
Wu.

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Ms. Fang.

24
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm drinking.

25
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,780
Wu.

26
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,880
Have you heard from Xiuming?

27
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:23,022
I've been looking all day
and still can't find him.

28
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,760
I haven't seen him.

29
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
No idea.

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,200
Alright.

31
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,400
If you hear anything,

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
call me right away.

33
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
Okay.

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
Okay.

35
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,200
Drink.

36
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,160
Let's keep drinking.

37
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,240
What's wrong with him?

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,600
He... what's...

39
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,533
What's wrong with him?

40
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
He can't.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,840
What?

42
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,460
He can't handle his liquor.

43
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,990
He can't

44
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,850
perform.

45
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,160
A man who can't perform...

46
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,920
A man

47
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,850
who can't perform!

48
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,950
Tell me in detail.

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,960
What did you see today?

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,888
Early this morning,

51
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,120
my cousin and I were working
in the vegetable field.

52
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,760
We saw someone lying there.

53
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,440
So we called the police.

54
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,600
Officer, we saw someone lying
on the ground

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,480
covered in blood.

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
It was terrifying.

57
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,120
Did you see anyone else around?

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,430
No.

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,280
No.

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
You're here.

61
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Tang.

62
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,155
Here's a photo of the victim.

63
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,040
It's Ye Xiuming.

64
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:36,940
Alright then.

65
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,955
I'll be in touch later.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,840
Okay, goodbye.

67
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,644
I've called everyone I could.

68
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,377
No one knows where Mr. Ye is.

69
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,890
This is bad.

70
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:50,644
Something must've happened to him.

71
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,960
I doubt it.

72
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
It's just one night.

73
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe it was a last-minute trip,

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,133
and his phone battery died?

75
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:58,422
That's happened before.

76
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,320
This time feels different.

77
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,640
The Anti-abduction Office

78
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,960
came straight to our house.

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
They asked me

80
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
a lot of questions about him.

81
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,888
The Anti-abduction Office?

82
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,160
Why would they look for Mr. Ye?

83
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,360
Yeah, I asked them too.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,200
I guess it's classified.

85
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
They wouldn't tell me.

86
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
I could ask Yanyan.

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,680
Right. I'll go find Yanyan.

88
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
Ms. Fang.

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680

92
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,955
Where's the operating room?

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,880
This way.

94
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,080
Here, this way.

95

96
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,790
How's my husband?

97
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:01,160
He's in emergency care.

98
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,533
(Emergency Treatment in Progress)
He fell from a height.

99
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,066
We're still investigating the details.

100
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,900
He...

101
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,760
He fell?

102
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
How did he fall?

103
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,120
How did he fall?

104
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
Is he badly hurt?

105
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,780
How could this even happen?

106
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,680
Please don't panic.

107
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,955
Let's wait for the doctor's update.

108
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,520
Did something happen to him?

109
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,280
Did he break the law?

110
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,360
Did he commit a crime?

111
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Why do you keep coming to our house,

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,080
but never tell me

113
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,520
what's really going on with him?

114
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,510
Did Xiuming break the law?

115
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,660

116
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,810
I...

117
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm his wife.

118
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
I want to know,

119
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,520
how is my husband?

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,120
Is he badly injured?

121
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:41,450
The patient has a skull fracture.

122
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:42,688
There's bleeding in the brain.

123
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,320
We just operated on him.

124
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,840
He's still unconscious for now.

125
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,880
Please,

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm begging you to save him.

127
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,160
Stay calm.

128
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,400
Please, Sir, I'm begging you.

129
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,840
Please keep him alive.

130
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,390
Don't panic.

131
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,111
We'll do everything we can to save him.

132
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
I promise.

133
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,980
Please do everything you can
to save him.

134
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,880
Yes, I will.

140
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,280
You're still here?

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,840
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,720
Earlier,

143
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,360
I completely lost control.

144
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
I was very rude to you.

145
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,120
It's alright.

146
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,560
Have a seat. Let's talk.

147
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
Okay.

148
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,040
Ms. Fang.

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,400
Last time at your house,

150
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,040
you told me that Ye Xiuming

151
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,133
was depressed after his tech company
shut down

152
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,444
and had been drinking at home.

153
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,600
So

154
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,010
besides that,

155
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,280
was there anything else

156
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,520
that may have affected his mood?

157
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,400
Or maybe

158
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,400
anyone he was in contact with?

159
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,790
Actually...

160
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,490
Before the accident,

161
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,880
we

162
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,810
had a huge fight.

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,640
He thought I had something inappropriate

164
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,890
going on with Mr. Wu.

165
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,160
But in reality,

166
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
he just heard some gossip
at the company.

167
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,200
I felt he didn't trust me at all.

168
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,160
So I...

169
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,210
I lashed out at him too.

170
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,640
I might have

171
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,760
hurt his pride.

172
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,080
So now Dingshun

173
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,680
is completely under Mr. Wu,

174
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,600
is that right?

175
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,960
Yes.

176
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,710
That too

177
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,070
was something

178
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,360
very hard on Xiuming.

179
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,480
He transferred all his shares

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,760
to

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,740
Wu Bin

182
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,600
and me.

183
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
Maybe he regretted it afterward.

184
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,550
I don't know.

185
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,980
If there are any updates in this case,

186
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
I really hope you'll

187
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,520
let me know right away.

188
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,280
Alright?

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,120
We will.

190
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,960
Honey.

191
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,920
Please wake up.

192
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
This is all my fault.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,640
I shouldn't have argued with you.

194
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,960
You were already upset,

195
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
and I said such hurtful things to you.

196
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm so sorry.

197
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,880
I love you so much.

198
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,280
It's just that things got so busy.

199
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,120
We were so busy

200
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,400
that we had no time,

201
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,080
no energy left

202
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,720
to even say "I love you".

203
00:12:57,888 --> 00:12:59,444
Mr. Wu has already checked in.

204
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,880
Come in.

205
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,000
How's Mr. Ye?

206
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,200
Zilin.

207
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
Why don't you

208
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,120
go home and rest?

209
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:40,866
I'll take over for you.

210
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,955
You've been exhausted
these past few days.

211
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,520
Besides, at home,

212
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,511
Qian needs you too.

213
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,977
Then talk to him more.

214
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,320
The doctor said

215
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
talking to him

216
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,088
can help wake him up.

217
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,955
Thank you.

218
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,440
Get some rest.

219
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,150
Zilin asked me

220
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,680
to talk to you more.

221
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:39,000
But what should I say?

222
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,520
Ye Xiuming,

223
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
you're one tough guy.

224
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,240
Even this didn't kill you.

225
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:51,755
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

226
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,240
I had no choice.

227
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
All these years,

228
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,333
what have you actually done?

229
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,320
(All the dirty, exhausting work)

230
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,920
(were handled by me.)

231
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,820
(Letter of Intent)

232
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:07,800
(Overseas Order Expenses)
(Do you think)

233
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,440
(Qinmang)
(you could land so many deals?)

234
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,140
(Legal Representative: Ye Xiuming)

235
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,177
(Let me be honest with you.)

236
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,920
(The entire Southeast Asia supply line)

237
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,466
(has been under my control
for a long time.)

238
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,440
(And now,)

239
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:23,440
(Dingshun no longer belongs to you.)

240
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,720
(As for Zilin,)

241
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,400
(I'll take care of her.)

242
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,480
I know

243
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:31,960
you're worried about Zilin.

244
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,040
But don't worry.

245
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,720
After you're gone,

246
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,600
I'll treat her well.

247
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,844
I know you can hear me.

248
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,600
If you really love Zilin,

249
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:08,844
then just die.

250
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,422
Shift that camera view
a bit to the left.

251
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,911
Captain Han, you wanted to see us?

252
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:17,720
Chang Rui.

253
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,360
Yan Lei, take a look.

254
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,680
This is the scene analysis report

255
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,777
from Ye Xiuming's case.

256
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,000
He didn't fall.

257
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,800
He was pushed.

258
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,600
Then does that mean

259
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,977
Ye Xiuming isn't Cripple?

260
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,822
And Director Deng no longer
needs to avoid

261
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,644
and can return
to the Anti-abduction Office.

262
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,320
That's right.

263
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,800
I'll submit the request to Chief Xiao.

264
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,300
(Nanjie Provincial People's Hospital)

265
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,680
Honey.

266
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:53,000
Let me give you a massage.

267
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,920
Does that feel good?

268
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,920
I remember when we first
started our business.

269
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,080
The company

270
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,920
was just the two of us.

271
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,490
You were exhausted every day,
back aching, and shoulders sore.

272
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,666
But you didn't want to spend money
on a massage.

273
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,320
Back then,

274
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,480
I took on the role
of your personal masseuse.

275
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,080
I didn't even know what I was doing,

276
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,000
just randomly pressing.

277
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,888
And you kept humoring me.

278
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
You said, "Honey,
you're amazing at this".

279
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,160
"Better than the pros

280
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,822
at the massage place".

281
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,240
I laughed so hard that day.

282
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,622
You were just trying to make me happy,
weren't you?

283
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
Please wake up soon.

284
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,400
Alright?

285
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,920
Honey,

286
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,320
I miss you so much.

287
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
Please wake up soon, okay?

288
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,540
(Ward A8)

289
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,480
Come in.

290
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,240
Yanyan.

291
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,480
Zilin.

292
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,880
Don't worry.

293
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,440
The doctor said your cousin
is out of danger now.

294
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,680
The coma is only temporary.

295
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,720
My parents are still out of town.

296
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,080
I don't even know
how to tell them about this.

297
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,040
Then don't tell them yet.

298
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,960
Wait a little while.

299
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's see how your cousin does,

300
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,960
and then decide.

301
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,560
How have you been lately?

302
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
You work during the day,

303
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,333
and come here at night
to care for my cousin.

304
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,600
You need to rest too.

305
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,920
It's not too bad, actually. Don't worry.

306
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,240
Sometimes Mr. Wu comes to help.

307
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,080
You mean Wu Bin?

308
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
On the night of my cousin's accident,

309
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:34,755
were the two of them together?

310
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,680
That night,

311
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,920
they weren't together.

312
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,960
I couldn't reach your cousin at all,

313
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,000
so I called Mr. Wu.

314
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,840
He was drinking at the time,

315
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,800
and he was very drunk.

316
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,280
It was with some company clients.

317
00:20:56,044 --> 00:20:58,044
Your colleagues
at the Anti-abduction Office

318
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,560
questioned me several times.

319
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,480
Is it because

320
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,600
Xiuming

321
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,320
was involved in a case?

322
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,280
I know you have to avoid
any conflict of interest

323
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,240
and can't say much.

324
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
But if there's any development
in the case,

325
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,440
including why he fell from the building,

326
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,200
please tell me right away, okay?

327
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,480
I promise you.

328
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,120
Thank you.

329
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,160
Director Deng, you're back.

330
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,800
You're back.

331
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,720
Are you okay?

332
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,960
Yes, I'm back.

333
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,000
Have a seat.

334
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,840
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

335
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,822
What does everyone think
about Ye Xiuming's fall?

336
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,960
Two things are fairly clear now.

337
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,920
First,

338
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,240
based on the crime scene,

339
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,720
Ye Xiuming didn't jump.

340
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
He was pushed off the building.

341
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,400
Second,

342
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,369
Ye Xiuming is no longer
a shareholder of Dingshun.

343
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,720
He voluntarily transferred his shares
to Fang Zilin and Wu Bin.

344
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,760
That contradicts Liu Gang's statement.

345
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,320
If Ye Xiuming wasn't the
main beneficiary of Dingshun,

346
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,440
then Fang Zilin and Wu Bin
look more suspicious.

347
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,360
We spoke to Dingshun's employees.

348
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,320
In reality,

349
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,200
Fang Zilin has long been semi-retired.

350
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:20,040
She hasn't been involved in management

351
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,880
or business operations for a long time.

352
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,480
Also,

353
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,640
all evidence points to Cripple
being a man.

354
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,400
That makes Wu Bin the top suspect.

355
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,840
Fang Zilin told me

356
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Lu Sheng's order

357
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
was brokered by Wu Bin.

358
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,240
We reviewed all the information again.

359
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,040
Cripple is a well-known trafficker
around Nanjie.

360
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,800
He somehow ended up at Dingshun

361
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,720
as a vice president.

362
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,480
If Wu Bin really is Cripple,

363
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:43,977
that means Huang Chuan,
Madam Hong, Liu Gang and the others

364
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,480
were part of his criminal network
before he changed identities.

365
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,360
Fei Yan, Skinner, Whiteboard,

366
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:49,840
those are part of his new identity's

367
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,160
current criminal network.

368
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:54,290
Ye Xiuming must've found out
something about Wu Bin.

369
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,080
So Wu Bin tried to silence him.

370
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,600
The cunning thing about Wu Bin

371
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,920
is how well he covers his tracks.

372
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,839
We don't have a single
solid piece of evidence.

373
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,920
Once Ye Xiuming wakes up,

374
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,660
at the very least, Wu Bin can be charged

375
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:04,555
with attempted murder.

376
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:05,920
Right now, what we need to do

377
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,880
is find the evidence.

378
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,760
Zilin.

379
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,360
I came today to ask you about someone.

380
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,640
Someone from your company,

381
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,120
Wu Bin.

382
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,800
Ma'am,

383
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,720
take Qian inside, please.

384
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,520
Alright.

385
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,240
Qian, let's go play in the room.

386
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,000
See you in a bit.

387
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,720
Actually, I was the one

388
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:50,577
who introduced Wu Bin to the company.

389
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
At first, he was just Xiuming's driver.

390
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,280
Later, your cousin felt

391
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,680
he was dependable

392
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,120
and quick on his feet,

393
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,720
so he made an exception
and promoted him.

394
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,600
To be fair, he didn't
let your cousin down.

395
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,320
Every single project

396
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,240
was completed flawlessly.

397
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,120
So he kept getting promoted
within the company.

398
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,240
He even helped Dingshun

399
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,600
survive a major crisis.

400
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,280
From driver to where he is now...

401
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,720
Looks like

402
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
you and Xiuming really trusted Wu Bin.

403
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,200
To be honest, we've always

404
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,280
trusted Wu Bin.

405
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,520
He was involved in everything,
big or small.

406
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,240
Later, when your cousin got busy
with the tech company,

407
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
he even handed over the company

408
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
to me and Wu Bin to manage.

409
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,320
Then, after Qian came,

410
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,600
pretty much all

411
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,440
company affairs were handled
solely by Wu Bin.

412
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,080
Then Zilin,

413
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,880
why did you recommend Wu Bin
to the company?

414
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Did you know him before?

415
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,960
To be honest,

416
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I do feel responsible.

417
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,040
I was the one who brought him in.

418
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,480
But the reason I did it

419
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,920
was due to a bit of personal guilt.

420
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,120
I wanted

421
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,320
to repay him.

422
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,480
Back when I was working my first job,

423
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,760
one day I left really late.

424
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,400
As I walked through an alley,

425
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,040
a few drunk men suddenly appeared.

426
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,280
They started,

427
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,920
you know,

428
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,600
harassing me.

429
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,480
Wu Bin suddenly showed up

430
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,560
and beat the daylights

431
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,440
out of those guys.

432
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,280
One of them was seriously injured.

433
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,040
Wu Bin ended up going to prison for it.

434
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,200
After that, I thought,

435
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,800
this man

436
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,440
had saved me.

437
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,400
No matter what,

438
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,480
I had to find a way

439
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,800
to repay him.

440
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,280
So when he got out of prison,

441
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,840
the first thing I did

442
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,240
was bring him into

443
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,640
the company.

444
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,490
I arranged for him
to be your cousin's driver.

445
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,840
We did look into Wu Bin before.

446
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,600
We found out he had a criminal record.

447
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,840
But we didn't know

448
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,440
that he went to jail

449
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
because of you.

450
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,880
So,

451
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,440
did my cousin know he'd been in prison?

452
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
I never told him.

453
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,800
It wasn't exactly something
to be proud of.

454
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,640
I figured, since we were
working together,

455
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,760
it'd be better to keep things simple.

456
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,840
It didn't affect
anything at work anyway.

457
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,200
So I just never told him.

458
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,840
Zilin,

459
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,240
you were the victim in all this.

460
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,244
You don't need to feel guilty about it.

461
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,120
It's alright.

462
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:57,044
With everything that's happened
to your cousin,

463
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
I blame myself.

464
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,920
I really regret it.

465
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,080
I

466
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,520
shouldn't have

467
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,280
fought with him like that.

468
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,960
But what's done is done.

469
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:12,666
Now I just have to find a way...

470
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,400
To find a way

471
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,240
to fix it.

472
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,560
It's okay, Zilin.

473
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,960
My cousin will get better.

474
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,680
And you

475
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,800
don't worry about us.

476
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,288
You've got your own work to handle.

477
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Take care of yourself.

478
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,640
And I'll focus on

479
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,280
taking care of your cousin,

480
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,600
be patient with him,

481
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,720
and love him.

482
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,260
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

483
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,320
We just received

484
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,680
a message from Qinmang's liaison,
Zou Yuhuai.

485
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,688
He said the overseas account
Liu Gang mentioned,

486
00:28:03,688 --> 00:28:05,466
the one that was used
to wire money to Cripple,

487
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:06,600
belongs to Jiji Trading.

488
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,080
That's the same company

489
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,680
that helped Mu Zhenliang adopt Mu Haobo.

490
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:14,440
Did we find anything else
about that company?

491
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Its background is pretty mysterious.

492
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080
This is all we could dig up.

493
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,760
I'm thinking

494
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
maybe we should
talk to Mu Zhenliang again.

495
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,160
He probably knows more.

496
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,400
But he's already gone back to Gangcheng.

497
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Should we go find him?

498
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,880
No need.

499
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,244
There's someone else in Linshan.

500
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,280
I already asked my dad about it.

501
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,760
The investment in Dingshun

502
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,040
was actually arranged

503
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,360
by Wu Bin of Dingshun Group.

504
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,680
Oh, right,

505
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,600
my dad also said

506
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,560
he wasn't the one
who invested in Dingshun.

507
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,400
It was actually a company
called Jiji Trading.

508
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,000
Are you sure the company's name
is Jiji Trading?

509
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,120
Yes.

510
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,400
They sent the money to my dad

511
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,120
and used his name for the investment.

512
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,488
In the end, they even gave him
10% of the shares.

513
00:28:58,311 --> 00:28:59,933
How much was the total investment?

514
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,680
23 million.

515
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,840
You worked at Dingshun

516
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,360
for quite a while, right?

517
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,600
Yes.

518
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,960
I was in charge of finance at Dingshun
the whole time.

519
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,377
Why did you suddenly quit?

520
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,240
It was Mr. Wu.

521
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,840
During our last partnership
with Lu Sheng's company,

522
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:22,480
something went wrong with the insurance.

523
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,040
He used that as an excuse to fire me.

524
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,440
Why did he push you out?

525
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
Because I discovered

526
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,680
he was doing shady stuff

527
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,240
at Dingshun behind Mr. Ye's back.

528
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,480
And you told Ye Xiuming about it?

529
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,240
Yes.

530
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,800
Give me that.

531
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,560
Give me that.

532
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,620
- Madam Zhang.
- Give me that.

533
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:43,000
Careful.

534
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,960
What are you doing?

535
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,760
Didn't we agree to close the shop?

536
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,040
What do you mean by that?

537
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,710
We agreed to shut it down for a few days

538
00:29:48,711 --> 00:29:50,488
so you could rest for a while.

539
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,720
Who are you?

540
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,880
You think you can just shut it down?

541
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,640
Put everything back.

542
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,400
Take those down.

543
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,800
- Put everything back!
- Okay...

544
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,120
Okay, we're putting it down.

545
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:01,280
Put them over there.

546
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,369
- Don't be upset.
- Back in place.

547
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,430
Okay, okay. Back in place.

548
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:06,960
What do you think you're doing?

549
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,840
What are you doing?

550
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,240
What do you think you're doing?

551
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,400
Who told you to take them down?

552
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,960
Move!

553
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,311
- Calm down, Madam Zhang.
- Okay.

554
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,810
What...

555
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,880
Madam Zhang, that's dangerous.

556
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,080
What are you doing? Move!

557
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,960
We'll put them up...

558
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,160
Get out of my way!

559
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,080
- Slow down.
- Don't climb up.

560
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,520
It's too dangerous.

561
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,160
Get away! Didn't I tell you?

562
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,680
If you take down

563
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,720
the children's photos,

they won't make it home.

565
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,480
Do you understand?

566
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Yes...

567
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,960
How about this?

568
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,066
Come down and I'll help you
put them back up, okay?

569
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:44,880
Please come down.

570
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,280
You're a bad person.

571
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,760
Get up.

572
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,920
What are you doing? Get away!

573
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,480
Get away from me.

574
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,960
What are you trying to do?

575
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,000
What are you doing? Get away!

576
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,520
You don't want Ranran to come home?

577
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,360
- Get away!
- Madam Zhang...

578
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,520
Get away!

579
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,080
Are you alright? Easy.

580
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,320
Madam Zhang.

581
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,080
Get away from me!

582
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,950
- Get away, all of you!
- Your hands are bleeding.

583
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,080
Let's put the chair down.

584
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,160
Get away...

585
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,840
You don't want Ranran to come home!

586
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,640
Can we please put the chair down?

587
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Move! All of you, move!

588
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,440
Alright. We'll leave.

589
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,880
Get away! Move!

590
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,800
We're done. We'll stop.

591
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,080
Move...

592
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,520
Get out.

593
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,840
- Get out.
- Madam Zhang.

594
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,000
Move...

595
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,160
(Mom!)

596
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,200
I'm home!

597
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,320
Ranran?

598
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,640
Ranran is back.

599
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
Madam Zhang, what's going on?

600
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,360
Come on...

601
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,920
Ranran is back.

602
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Get away!

603
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:52,880
- Madam Zhang.
- Ranran.

604
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Ranran.

605
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
These bad people

606
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,400
wanted to shut us down
so you couldn't come back.

607
00:31:58,688 --> 00:32:00,000
But she came back, didn't she?

608
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Ranran...

609
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,920
School's out?

610
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Why aren't you wearing your red scarf?

611
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,920
Ranran,

612
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,240
your hair

613
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,440
still

614
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,400
looks best with two braids,
one on each side.

615
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,080
Did you have a test today?

616
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,760
How did it go?

617
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,640
Not so well?

618
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,560
You don't want to tell Mom, do you?

619
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,960
That's okay.

620
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,160
Just try harder next time.

621
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,560
Mom.

622
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,360
I got a hundred.

623
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,480
You scored a hundred?

624
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,680
My Ranran is amazing.

625
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,960
A perfect score.

626
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,680
Didn't you say that if I got a hundred,

627
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,760
you'd take me to the aquarium?

628
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,000
That's right, to the aquarium.

629
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,520
When would you like to go?

630
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,320
Anytime. We can go whenever you want.

631
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,480
How great, a perfect score.

632
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,600
Mom.

633
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:15,960
Wherever you want to go,

634
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,880
just tell me.

635
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,320
I'll take you.

636
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,360
As long as I'm with you,

637
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:22,777
anywhere is fine.

638
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,200

639
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,760
Promise Mom,

640
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,880
from now on,

641
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:35,044
you'll never leave me again, okay?

642
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,600
Okay?

643
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,400
Okay.

644
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,760
Pinky swear.

645
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,920
Pinky swear, hang it high,
no backing out for a hundred years.

646
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,840
Deal.

647
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,060
(Dingshun Group)

648
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,600
Ms. Zhang.

649
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,400
Why haven't any contracts

650
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,440
or financial reports

651
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,955
been delivered to my office lately?

652
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,040
Ms. Fang, the finance manager said

653
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,360
I should just send them
directly to Mr. Wu.

654
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:32,680
I want to see them now.

655
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,080
Please go get them for me.

656
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,640
I'm talking to you.

657
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,920
Give me the contracts
and financial reports.

Where's the finance manager?

663
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,080
She's not in yet.

664
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,400
Call her.

665
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,040
Sorry, Ms. Fang.

666
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,960
I'm late.

667
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,600
Explain this to me.

668
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,840
Why were full advance payments made

669
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,320
on so many major recent orders?

670
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,160
More importantly,

671
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,360
the legal representative
has already changed.

672
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,280
It's no longer Mr. Ye.

673
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,160
Then why is every single contract

674
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,800
still signed with Ye Xiuming's name?

675
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm not really sure.

676
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,920
I was just following instructions.

677
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,320
Mr. Wu's here.

have been with me for so many years.

680
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:53,711
But something this serious...

681
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,160
I'm truly disappointed.

683
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,160

to show her that?

if you want to see the contracts

688
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,040
and financial statements,

689
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,644
just let me know in advance.

690
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,160
I won't hide anything from you.

692
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,600
You forged it, didn't you?

693
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,560
I'll explain later, okay?

694
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,280
Wu.

695
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,160
How's Mr. Ye doing?

696
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,240

697
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,600

Dr. Zhang? Aren't you
supposed to be off shift?

709
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:47,111

710
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,200
