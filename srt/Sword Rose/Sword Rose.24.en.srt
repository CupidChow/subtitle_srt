=Episode 24=

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,079
You'll help us get the child back, right?

4
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,349
Don't worry.

5
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,555
We'll do everything we can

6
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:43,480
to get the child back.

7
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,480
Kui isn't my child.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,159
Where's her mother?

9
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,359
Xiaolu!

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,840
Xiaolu!

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,239
Where is Kui?

12
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:57,840
- Kui.
- Are you from Anti-abduction Office?

13
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,159
Yes.

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,519
Are you her mother?

15
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,640
Yes, I am.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,719
I'm Kui's mother.

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,599
I saw it clearly.

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,519
It was a blue van.

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,920
Someone got out and took Kui.

20
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,879
Tang Dongquan.

21
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,840
It must be him.

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,120
Tang Dongquan?

23
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,479
Arrest Tang Dongquan now!

24
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,479
He must have taken my child!

25
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,439
Calm down.

26
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,319
We need to know the details first.

27
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:24,500
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

28
00:02:25,577 --> 00:02:27,000
Should we contact the traffic police

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,333
to check surveillance for the van?

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,733
Jiajia, are you free to check it?

31
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,560
I have so much footage to review.

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,800
I don't have time.

33
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,680
Kui's mother has been waiting
in the reception room for a long time.

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,639
We're overwhelmed and understaffed.

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,439
What do we do?

36
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,840
- Rui.
- Rui, you're back.

37
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,199
Rui.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
What's the situation?

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,639
The child's name is Tang Zhikui.

40
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,439
Nicknamed Kui.

41
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:50,810
She's 1 year and 3 months old.

42
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,199
Her mother, Hu Xiaolu, firmly believes

43
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,080
that the child's father,

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,599
Tang Dongquan, took the child.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,520
She's in the reception room now.

46
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,288
Has Tang Dongquan been found?

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
We haven't been able to reach him.

48
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,240
Yan Lei, take Feng

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,120
to find Tang Dongquan.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,520
Jiajia and Ai Xin,

51
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,560
go talk to the mother.

52
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,319
Okay.

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,319
Rui, also, about...

54
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,488
the van that took the child...

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
I checked the footage.

56
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,629
That van

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,511
passed through
an area without surveillance

58
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,355
and disappeared.

59
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,088
I suspect it has fake plates.

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,590
Feng, ask the traffic police.

61
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,879
Rui, where should I go?

62
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,479
It's okay.

63
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,888
I'll go myself.

64
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:35,120
Come on.

65
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,870
Let's work.

66
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:21,360
Captain Han.

67
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:23,844
We checked the surveillance
at Director Deng's stairwell

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,977
and found it to be damaged.

69
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,040
And the fingerprints
on the bag containing the money

70
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:28,022
aren't Director Deng's.

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,759
What does that mean?

72
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,240
It means Director Deng was framed.

73
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,360
Since that person went there,

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,839
they would've left clues.

75
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,480
Expand the search area.

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,511
Keep investigating.

77
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

78
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,600
Do you know this person?

79
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,333
Not at all.

80
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,400
Play it again.

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,519
Stop.

82
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,480
Zoom in on this.

83
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,240
Okay.

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,920
That bag...

85
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,040
The bag was gone

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,439
after this person left.

87
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,519
He must have placed it in your wardrobe.

88
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,360
On the night you were reported,

89
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,720
the camera below your building

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,911
was damaged.

91
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,199
But a supermarket across from your place

92
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,319
also has a camera.

93
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,319
We got this footage from them.

94
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Since we have this footage,

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,079
doesn't it prove my innocence?

96
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,160
Can I return to work now?

97
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,839
Not yet.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
There are still

99
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,040
some details to verify.

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,839
Once we verify them,

101
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,480
we'll report to Discipline Committee

102
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,360
and wait for their instructions.

103
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,560
Deng Yan.

104
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,439
You need to trust the system.

105
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,839
I believe we'll get answers soon.

106
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,360
Actually,

107
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,066
I'm more anxious than anyone.

108
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,022
Anti-abduction Office needs you.

109
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,040
I've always believed in you.

110
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,319
Hang in there.

111
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,839
Okay, I understand.

112
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,133
I'll head home first, Captain Han.

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Alright.

114
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,920
(Officers.)

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,839
(Here's what happened.)

116
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,519
(My friend and I)

117
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,720
(drove the kid to preschool.)

118
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,319
Here, Kui.

119
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,759
Let's eat some grapes.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,480
Here, open your mouth. Yes.

121
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,319
Careful.

122
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,199
Xiaolu.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,959
How have things been
between you and Mr. Tang?

124
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,800
Still the same.

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,519
Xiaolu.

126
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,759
You really should think it over.

127
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,519
If you keep dragging this on,

128
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,720
it will only make things worse.

129
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,720
You should tell that to Mr. Tang.

130
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,133
If he agrees to give me the child,

131
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:11,844
I won't stay with him another minute.

132
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,120
Here, Kui.

133
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,160
Let's have a blueberry.

134
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,079
Careful!

135
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,279
Is Kui okay?

136
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,519
She's fine.

137
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:38,120
You take care of Kui.

138
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
I'll go handle this.

139
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:39,919
Alright.

140
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,519
Be careful.

141
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,360
What kind of driving is that?
You changed lanes forcibly.

142
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,159
(I was arguing with the driver.)

143
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,519
For some reason,

144
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,559
Minmin got out with Kui in her arms.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,240
Why would I scam you?

146
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:00,840
No.

147
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,559
Xiaolu.

148
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you alright?

149
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,519
I'm fine. I just ran into a jerk.

150
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:06,510
Get back into the car.

151
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,240
I'll handle this.

152
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,200
You... Who are you calling a jerk?

153
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,399
What's that attitude?

154
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,440
What attitude?

155
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
You drive without insurance.

156
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,720
You even forcibly cut lanes
and hit my car.

157
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,320
What attitude do you expect?

158
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,679
Alright.

159
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,149
Xiaolu, stop arguing with him.

160
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,288
Let's just call the police.

161
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,960
There were a lot of cars.

162
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,390
I was worried about them hitting Kui,

163
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,759
so I asked Minmin
to get back into the car with Kui.

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,240
I told her
not to take Kui out of the car.

165
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,240
Then...

166
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,399
Calm down.

167
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,879
What's your relationship
with Fang Minmin?

168
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,039
We've been friends for many years.

169
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,399
She's basically my bestie.

170
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,244
I never should've gotten out.

171
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
I was the one who lost Kui.

172
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,320
Officers.

173
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,360
Please help me find Kui.

174
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,399
Later,
Minmin took Kui back into the car.

175
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,510
I was too focused on the driver.

176
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:57,510
I was arguing with him.

177
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,840
I didn't notice my child.

178
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,120
At some point, a vehicle appeared

179
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
and snatched my child from the car.

180
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,120
I have two options.

181
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,840
File an insurance claim

182
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,360
or you pay for the repairs.

183
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,670
- Let's talk calmly.
- What are you doing?

184
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,720
- My car...
- Xiaolu!

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,600
Xiaolu!

186
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,039
Kui!

187
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,080
Kui!

188
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,440
No.

189
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:17,777
- Miss!
- Get out of the way!

190
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,559
How much?

191
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,679
Kui!

192
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,400
(Tang Dongquan.)

193
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,399
Tang Dongquan must've taken my child.

194
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,960
You asked your questions.

195
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,639
Arrest Tang Dongquan now.

196
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,960
He's Kui's father.

197
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,519
We're separated.

198
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,600
He kept threatening to take my child.

199
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,080
Are you fighting for custody?

200
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,919
That's what I thought too.

201
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,159
I thought he was after the custody,

202
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,960
but I've been calling him

203
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,759
since it happened.

204
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,960
He never answered.

205
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,440
If he didn't take the child,

206
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,240
why wouldn't he answer my calls?

207
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:51,960
Well then.

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,799
Do you know Tang Dongquan?

209
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,200
He's Xiaolu's husband

210
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,759
and our Mr. Tang.

211
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,720
Our Mr. Tang?

212
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,639
Do you work

213
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
at Tang Dongquan's company?

214
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,320
Yes.

215
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,600
Xiaolu recommended me to work

216
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:10,288
as his assistant.

217
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,279
Do you know

218
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,039
if Tang Dongquan ever offended anyone

219
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,080
or made enemies

220
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,133
in the business world?

221
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,519
He's a really nice guy.

222
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,039
He doesn't seem to have enemies.

223
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,480
Then why does Hu Xiaolu believe

224
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,039
Tang Dongquan took the child?

225
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,480
Xiaolu is just too suspicious.

226
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,840
It couldn't be Tang Dongquan.

227
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,240
Tell me.

228
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,600
While you and Tang Dongquan
were separated,

229
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,240
did he visit Kui?

230
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,480
Yes,

231
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,720
but

232
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,320
we argued and fought every time he came.

233
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,440
He even wanted to take Kui away.

234
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,919
Later, I stopped letting him visit.

235
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,488
We were always at each other's throats.

236
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,279
Every time we argued,

237
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,159
he said he wanted to take Kui away.

238
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,399
Xiaolu was always on edge.

239
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,080
She was afraid Tang Dongquan
would take the child.

240
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,639
Ms. Hu, may I ask

241
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,440
why you and your husband are separated?

242
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,919
We used to be fine.

243
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,480
After his company took off,

244
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,240
he was never home.

245
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,759
I asked him many times,

246
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,679
hoping for an explanation,

247
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,240
but he was always impatient.

248
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,799
He must be having an affair.

249
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,039
He must be having an affair.

250
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,360
You suspect an affair.

251
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,679
Did you see it yourself

252
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,360
or

253
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,879
do you have proof?

254
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:49,679
No.

255
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,960
I've never seen it.

256
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,759
But you're a woman too.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,799
Do you believe in a woman's intuition?

258
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,759
Mine tells me

259
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,120
he's having an affair.

260
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,080
He must have planned with that woman

261
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,480
to take away my child.

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,480
Arrest him.

263
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,879
Hurry and arrest them.

264
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,559
I'll share what I've found out so far.

265
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,080
Hu Xiaolu and her husband,
Tang Dongquan,

266
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,200
have a bad relationship.

267
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,320
They've been separated
for quite a while.

268
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,519
Hu Xiaolu suspects

269
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,120
Tang Dongquan is having an affair,

270
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,200
so she doesn't let him visit the child.

271
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,919
But

272
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,679
she believes he's taken the child.

273
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,600
Where is he now?

274
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:28,510
According to his company,

275
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,279
they took a project in Qinghai.

276
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,799
Tang Dongquan takes it seriously.

277
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,480
He even led a team there.

278
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,919
They said they could reach him
a few days ago,

279
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,559
but now he's unreachable.

280
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,759
The team in Qinghai said

281
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,559
he drove off on his own.

282
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,360
His child was taken,

283
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,440
and he just drove off to work?

284
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,639
He's not even worried?

285
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,759
That's suspicious.

286
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,200
But the projects they handle

287
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,320
are all remote construction work,

288
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,480
so losing contact for days
isn't unusual.

289
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,679
Chang Rui.

290
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,240
Chang Rui!

291
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,679
Did you hear what I just said?

292
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,080
What else? What...

293
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,720
What else?

294
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,679
I have something.

295
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,679
Fang Minmin

296
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,159
has a crush on Tang Dongquan.

297
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,919
Everyone at the company knows it,

298
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
but Hu Xiaolu doesn't.

299
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,480
I've got a theory.

300
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
Is it possible that Hu Xiaolu refused

301
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,080
to let Tang Dongquan visit the child,

302
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,200
so Fang Minmin found someone

303
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,399
to take the child

304
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,720
and give her to Tang Dongquan?

305
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,440
This way, she could please
Tang Dongquan,

306
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,822
and sabotage their marriage

307
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,044
at the same time.

308
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,960
What do we do now?

309
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:58,759
Director.

310
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,879
- You're back.
- Director.

311
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,320
It's okay.

312
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,279
Sit.

313
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,759
Sit.

314
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,200
It's alright now.

315
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,600
Someone tried to frame me,

316
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,840
but it's all been investigated.

317
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:11,911
I came back to work.

318
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,550
How has everyone been

319
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,039
during this time?

320
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,600
In just a few weeks,

321
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:44,266
a lot has happened
at Anti-abduction Office.

322
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,720
You all achieved a lot.

323
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,039
Of course,

324
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,039
we also lost a nice colleague.

325
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,000
But no matter what,

326
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,360
our work must go on.

327
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,555
We mustn't forget

328
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:06,720
police officers'

329
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,039
most important duty.

330
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:15,066
Let's work.

331
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,200
Madam, excuse me,

332
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,599
have you seen this child?

333
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,599
Please take a closer look.

334
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,759
Roughly...

335
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,160
Has a man ever been seen
with this child?

336
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,022
Have you seen them?

337
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:28,550
No.

338
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,720
Maybe ask someone else.

339
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,519
Okay, thank you.

340
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,799
Hello, Sir.

341
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,759
Do you recognize this child?

342
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,640
Madam, do you recognize her?

343
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,559
No.

344
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:37,550
Have you seen her?

345
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,269
A man...

346
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,850
- Think again.
- Do you recognize her?

347
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,480
No.

348
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,310
I've never seen her.

349
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,799
Thank you.

350
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:44,640
Let's go there.

351
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,319
What's wrong? Stop crying.

352
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,440
Stop crying.

353
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,039
Stop crying.

354
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,880
Stop crying.

355
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,720
Where are you going?

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,640
Train station.

357
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,200
Stop crying.

358
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,599
Stop crying.

359
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,829
We're almost there.

360
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,044
What's wrong with the child?

361
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,349
Nothing.

362
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,155
She's just a baby, so she cries easily.

363
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:24,920
Where's the mom?

364
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,839
A man traveling alone with a toddler

365
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,640
is tough.

366
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,880
She passed away.

367
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,119
(Attention.)

368
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,400
(Urgent missing child alert.)

369
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,519
(Tang Zhikui,)

370
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,319
(female,)

371
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,440
(15 months old,)

372
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,377
(was abducted yesterday
at the intersection)

373
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,511
(of the middle section
of Renmin Road, Linshan City.)

374
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,599
(The suspect fled)

375
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,319
(in a blue van.)

376
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,799
(Tang Zhikui was
wearing a beige jumpsuit.)

377
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,039
(If you find anything)

378
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:53,920
(related to Tang Zhikui)

379
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,279
(or that blue van,)
Stop crying.

380
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,839
(please call)

381
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,720
(877)

382
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,319
(17678.)
Another child missing?

383
00:18:59,319 --> 00:18:59,960
(877...)

384
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,680
These traffickers are lawless.

385
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,222
Stop crying.

386
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:05,133
Watch your child carefully.

387
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
It's crowded on the train. Be careful.

388
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,039
Thank you.

389
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,119
Sweetheart.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,319
Here.

391
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,279
I got you a gift.

392
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,759
Here.

393
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:39,680
Have a look.

394
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,160
Wenwen.

395
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,480
Wenwen.

396
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,480
Wenwen, where have you been hiding?

397
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:06,000
Where have you been hiding?

398
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,720
I've been looking so long for you.

399
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,839
My baby.

400
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,160
Did you miss me?

401
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,599
Did you miss me?

402
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,000
Are you afraid of me?

403
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,279
Are you afraid of me?

404
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,440
Are you afraid of me?

405
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,359
Don't be afraid.

406
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,200
I'm here.

407
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,380
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

408
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,000
You've been working too hard lately.

409
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,279
Running back and forth.

410
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,319
Why don't you head home early today?

411
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm here anyway.

412
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,069
It's alright.

413
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,400
I have nothing else to do anyway.

414
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,440
Go ahead.

415
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,480
I'll take Madam Zhang home later.

416
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,720
Let's go together later.

417
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,599
Sure.

418
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,599
Hello?

419
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,599
Hello?

420
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Is this He Meilian?

421
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,240
Yes, it's me.

422
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm from Linshan's
Anti-abduction Office.

423
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,799
We found your child.

424
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,960
Come over tomorrow.

425
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,688
What did you say?

426
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,319
Say it again.

427
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,680
We found your child.

428
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,688
Can you come tomorrow?

429
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,960
Tomorrow?

430
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,640
Tomorrow, right?

431
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,359
Yes.

432
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:16,559
Okay.

433
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,519
No problem.

434
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,759
I...

435
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,160
I'll definitely go.

436
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,240
I'll definitely go.

437
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,079
Okay.

438
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,000
Goodbye.

439
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,266
They found my child.

440
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,039
Ms. Meilian.

441
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,440
What happened?

442
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,400
Xiaoxing.

443
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,720
My child

444
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,599
has been found.

445
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,400
They found my son.

446
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,400
They found your son?

447
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,240
Found?

448
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,960
Found what?

449
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,240
Zhang.

450
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,519
My son

451
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,240
has been found.

452
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,680
They found him?

453
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,279
Your son has been found?

454
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,279
They found him.

455
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,079
An officer from Anti-abduction Office

456
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,400
just called me,

457
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,640
asking me
to go over and confirm tomorrow.

458
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,440
Zhang.

459
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
This is amazing.

460
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,559
My son is coming home.

461
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,640
They finally found him.

462
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,440
My son is coming home.

463
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,279
Zhang.

464
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,640
I'm not dreaming, right?

465
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,000
- It's not a dream.
- I'm not dreaming, right?

466
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,200
Does it hurt when I pinch you?

467
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,240
It's not a dream.

468
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,759
Meilian.

469
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,240
This is wonderful.

470
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,880
The wait was worth it.

471
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,480
By the way,

472
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,200
take that down.

473
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,039
Hurry.

474
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,700
(Missing Person)

475
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,599
How great.

476
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,920
How great.

477
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,720
Stop crying.

478
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:16,880
Be happy.

479
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,519
You should be happy for this.

480
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:20,799
How great.

481
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,799
Hurry home.

482
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,400
Go home.

483
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,440
Tidy everything up

484
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,359
to welcome

485
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,200
your son.

486
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:30,559
Okay.

487
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,200
Hurry home.

488
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,200
Okay.

489
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,880
I'll head home first.

490
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,440
Hurry.

491
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,240
Okay.

492
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,480
I'll go home first.

493
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,720
How great.

494
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:43,350
Watch for cars.

495
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,279
Careful.

496
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,088
Hello, enjoy your cake.

497
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,759
Thank you.

498
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,839
Kui

499
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,559
should be eating right now.

500
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,333
She also needs to be given solid foods.

501
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,640
But Kui is allergic to eggs.

502
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,160
When Kui was abducted,

503
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,279
that trafficker...

504
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,519
What if...

505
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,640
Xiaolu, pull yourself together.

506
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,039
Your current state is crucial.

507
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,279
I've called on all our friends

508
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,640
to help us find Kui.

509
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,559
Don't worry.

510
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,555
But how will the trafficker treat her?

511
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,640
Kui must be so scared.

512
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,720
Don't overthink it.

513
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,799
Wasn't the Smiley who was abducted

514
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,079
found?

515
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,759
Smiley

516
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,839
was abandoned because she had

517
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,480
a congenital heart disease.

518
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,119
Kui is healthy

519
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,559
and adorable.

520
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,279
Whoever has her

521
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,310
won't want to give her up...

522
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,519
Xiaolu.

523
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,279
I'm responsible for this.

524
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,119
I've already taken a long leave.

525
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,839
Don't worry.
I'll stay with you to find Kui.

526
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,559
Thank goodness for you.

527
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,359
Otherwise,

528
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,160
I wouldn't know what to do.

529
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,319
Tang Dongquan.

530
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,079
It must be Tang Dongquan.

531
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,119
He must've done this.

532
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,519
Why else would he suddenly disappear?

533
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,119
Xiaolu, calm down.

534
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,720
Mr. Tang isn't like that.

535
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,200
Minmin.

536
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,640
You're his assistant.

537
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,799
Have you noticed him
seeing someone lately?

538
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,039
No, Xiaolu.

539
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,440
He's super busy with work.

540
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,240
He has no time for that.

541
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,559
Don't overthink it.

542
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
What matters most now

543
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,519
is finding Kui soon.

544
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:50,270
Even the police can't find her.

545
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,119
Where are we supposed to look?

546
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,440
By the way, Xiaolu,

547
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,440
I saw on the news a few days ago,

548
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,920
that there seems to be

549
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,960
a gathering spot

550
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,200
for missing children cases.

551
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,319
Why don't we try going there?

552
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,960
Sure.

553
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:09,955
Let's go.

554
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,359
I need to pick up my grandson.

555
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:24,720
You'd better hurry home then.

556
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,240
Go home.

557
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,880
Okay.

558
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:29,599
Go home.

559
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,319
I'm off.

560
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:30,720
Go.

561
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,279
I'm off.

562
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,079
Watch for the cars.

563
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,519
Xiaoxing.

564
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,119
Xiaoxing, what's wrong?

565
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:56,680
Xiaoxing.

566
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,440
What's wrong?

567
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,359
Nothing.

568
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:04,759
I just

569
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,279
saw everyone leaving.

570
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,079
This restaurant is getting quieter.

571
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,759
There are only the two of us left.

572
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,359
Xiaoxing,

573
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,799
look.

574
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,759
What is Tuanyuan Restaurant for?

575
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,240
Tuanyuan Restaurant

576
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,240
is

577
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:33,759
for

578
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,440
bringing families

579
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
back together.

580
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:39,444
Right?

581
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,039
See?

582
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,960
All the kids

583
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,720
on the wall

584
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,359
have been found.

585
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,519
Even your brother...

586
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,559
He'll come home.

587
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,279
Isn't that great?

588
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,000
Isn't that great?

589
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:22,640
Be happy.

590
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,440
Director.

591
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,400
The child's father
is on a business trip.

592
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,319
We can't reach him.

593
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,319
You two check his travel records.

594
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,240
Find him
the moment he returns to Linshan.

595
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,488
- Yes.
- Okay.

596
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:51,960
Well?

597
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,559
I checked. No back door.

598
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:56,510
We've waited so long.

599
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,599
Still no sign of him.

600
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,480
To be safe,

601
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,400
let's keep waiting.

602
00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:02,800
As long as he hasn't checked out,

603
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:03,577
he'll show up.

604
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:10,550
Hello. I'd like to extend my stay
for two nights.

605
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:10,960
Sure.

606
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,559
Hello, you're all set.

607
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,200
Is that him?

608
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,240
Looks like him.

609
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:20,559
Follow him.

610
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:26,960
Tang Dongquan?

611
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,319
Who are you?

612
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:32,355
We're from Linshan City Police Bureau.

613
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,839
Please come with us.

614
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:37,720
Xiaolu.

615
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,359
This is the place.

616
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:40,400
Many kids

617
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,960
were found after putting up

618
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,880
their posters here.

619
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,440
Okay.

620
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,200
Let's go.

621
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,119
Hello.

622
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:50,511
Sorry to bother you.

623
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,680
Our child is missing.

624
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,960
Can you help us?

625
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,359
No problem.

626
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,240
Do you have a missing person notice?

627
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,519
I can help you put it on the wall.

628
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,880
Our volunteers will help search too.

629
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,079
We'll notify you
as soon as there's news.

630
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,000
A missing person notice?

631
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,000
Will a photo be okay?

632
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,680
Sure.

633
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,799
Xiaolu.

634
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,279
Did you bring Kui's photo?

635
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,270
How long have these kids been missing?

636
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,960
Some were found
in just two or three years.

637
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,119
Some took longer than that.

638
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,359
10 and even 20 years.

639
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,844
My brother's been missing for 15 years.

640
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,319
I'm still looking.

641
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,079
No.

642
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,200
No.

643
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,079
- It can't be.
- Xiaolu.

644
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,400
- Don't panic.
- Calm down.

645
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,400
My Kui isn't like those kids.

646
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,319
My Kui was not lost.

647
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,400
Tang Dongquan.

648
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,559
It must be Tang Dongquan.

649
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,240
I'll call him.

650
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:51,155
Pick up, Tang Dongquan.

651
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,279
Xiaolu.

652
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,519
Let's calm down first.

653
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,000
Why don't we try here first?

654
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,519
I'm not searching here.

655
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:00,749
I'm not searching here!

656
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,933
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

657
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:03,759
Xiaolu!

658
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,160
Tang Dongquan.

659
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,960
Where have you been lately?

660
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,240
I was in Qinghai,

661
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,355
working on a project.

662
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,155
Why are you out of reach?

663
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:13,790
There's no signal there.

664
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,720
Xiaolu knew about it.

665
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,720
Your wife, Hu Xiaolu,

666
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,920
told us

667
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,933
that you abducted Kui.

668
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,119
How is that possible?

669
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:28,960
I...

670
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,440
Yes.

671
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,480
We're getting divorced,

672
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,444
but I have no need
to abduct my own child.

673
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,359
The reason for your separation

674
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,559
was your infidelity.

675
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,240
Is that true?

676
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,359
Hu Xiaolu insists

677
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,160
Kui was taken either by you

678
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,039
or your mistress.

679
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,359
So, Mr. Tang,

680
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,640
who is your mistress?

681
00:32:15,844 --> 00:32:17,066
Is it Fang Minmin?

682
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:23,559
Yes,

683
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,039
but we've already broken up.

684
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,799
Fang Minmin

685
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,680
kept pestering me

686
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,079
to get a divorce and marry her.

687
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,680
I refused.

688
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,279
Do you think

689
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,160
Fang Minmin would take Kui

690
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,440
to pressure you?

691
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:49,622
I don't think so.

692
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,039
But

693
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,519
when Xiaolu and I were divorcing,

694
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:57,960
I said

695
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,200
I wanted custody of the child.

696
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:02,640
She said she'd help.

697
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,160
Hurry and find the Kui.

698
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,480
Why waste time on me?

699
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,480
Fang Minmin.

700
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,319
We found Tang Dongquan.

701
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,488
He came clean about your relationship.

702
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,644
Our relationship?

703
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:27,960
Yes,

704
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,549
we're coworkers.

705
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm his assistant.

706
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,720
You weren't just coworkers.

707
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,359
Want me to say the details?

708
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,039
Fine.

709
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,400
We were together,

710
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,240
but

711
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,640
that's our private matter.

712
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,839
What's that got to do with Kui?

713
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,000
Tang Dongquan said

714
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,960
you threatened him

715
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,480
and pressured him to divorce.

716
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,160
You said you'd help him

717
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,000
get custody of the child.

718
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,310
He really said that?

719
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,400
I love Kui.

720
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,239
He knows that.

721
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,239
Besides,

722
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,519
I only said that to scare him.

723
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,400
You don't think

724
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,159
this has something to do with me,
do you?

725
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,239
Abducting a child is a crime.

726
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,960
I will never do that.

727
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,320
How long were you together?

728
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,719
Tang Dongquan and I are true lovers.

729
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,280
He didn't say that.

730
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,280
He said

731
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,644
you were a mistake.

732
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,800
Tell us

733
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,559
why you went to Hu Xiaolu?

734
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,000
I only wanted to persuade her.

735
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,840
She's not a good match
for Tang Dongquan.

736
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,199
They argue every day.

737
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,239
It's bad for everyone if this goes on.

738
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,149
Xiaolu never understood him.

739
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,733
They might as well get a divorce soon.

740
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:17,555
I admit

741
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,239
I had selfish reasons,

742
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,440
but I wouldn't abduct a child.

743
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,360
Have you thought about it?

744
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,039
If Hu Xiaolu

745
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,000
found out about your affair
with Tang Dongquan,

746
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:35,266
what would she think?

747
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:41,688
I wronged Xiaolu.

748
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,079
But even without me,

749
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,159
they would've split anyway.

750
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,199
Officers.

751
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,360
Please

752
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,000
don't tell Xiaolu this.

753
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,559
I don't want her to be hurt again.

754
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,559
I'll call you if there's anything new.

755
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,239
Keep your phone on.

756
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,760
Okay.

757
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,519
Tang Dongquan.

758
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,039
Where did you hide Kui?

759
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,559
Give Kui back to me!

760
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,159
I didn't take Kui!

761
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,480
Officer.

762
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,440
Don't believe him!

763
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,000
He's full of lies!

764
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,480
Ms. Hu, calm down.

765
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,880
Talk properly. Don't shout.

766
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,679
Finding Kui is the priority.

767
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:34,559
Xiaolu.

768
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,599
Are you having an affair?

769
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,280
Did you

770
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,400
and that woman take Kui?

771
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,577
Don't imagine things, okay?

772
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,955
I'm also worried
about Kui's disappearance.

773
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,199
Let's find her together, okay?

774
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,488
(I've handled everything.)

775
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,333
(When will you pay me?)

776
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:44,590
(I'll pay after I confirm it.)

777
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:45,960
(I promise.)

778
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,088
There are so many toys.

779
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,222
Look, baby.

780
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,760
We're just going for a walk.

781
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:59,110
We don't need this much.

782
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,159
No, the child needs everything.

783
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:02,960
Right, Wenwen?

784
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,960
Let's ride the car.

785
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,159
Let's go.

786
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,320
We're going out.

787
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,239
Didn't I tell you

788
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,519
not to come for no reason?

789
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,280
What's there to fear?

790
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,320
It's been a while since I saw you.

791
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,280
Better safe than sorry.

792
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,639
I've said it countless times.

793
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,559
You might die without knowing why.

794
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Yes.

795
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,199
You're right, Gang.

796
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,199
Haven't I always been careful?

797
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,719
I just wanted to see you.

798
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,280
How are things with the child?

799
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,239
We've sent her to the person.

800
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,559
Anything else?

801
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,280
Say it.

802
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,159
Actually,

803
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,559
I've got good news.

804
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,960
The overseas labor contract

805
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:15,800
is settled.

806
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,360
That fast?

807
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,400
As expected,

808
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,760
the older, the wiser.

809
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,360
Who?

810
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,079
Who's that good?

811
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,159
Didn't I tell you before?

812
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,360
Ask what you should.

813
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,719
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

814
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,199
Got it.

815
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,480
Congratulations.

816
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,039
Ms. Zhen.

817
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,639
Gang.

818
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,440
You're such a joker.

819
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,760
I'm just helping you out.

820
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,199
Let's settle some big deals

821
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,199
and disappear.

822
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,000
This business

823
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,000
is getting harder and harder.

824
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,440
Here's the thing.

825
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,599
Well...

826
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,320
I got suspicious after the incident.

827
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,960
He could leave

828
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,400
just like that.

829
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,039
He must've had a backup car.

830
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,199
So...

831
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:19,440
Take a look at this.

832
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,149
I found these tire marks

833
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,444
in the woods near the scene.

834
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:26,800
Based on these tire marks,

835
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,199
I suspect

836
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,960
it's an old sedan.

837
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,320
So I...

838
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,000
I...

839
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,119
I suggest...

840
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:35,559
Well...

841
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,280
Focusing our next search

842
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,880
on second-hand

843
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,519
or even scrap vehicles.

844
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:41,960
You kid.

845
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,280
Alright.

846
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:44,360
I think

847
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,639
the information you provided

848
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,920
is useful.

849
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,239
I'll pass it to the task force

850
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,577
and let them follow up.

851
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,280
How is Kui's case?

852
00:41:55,355 --> 00:41:56,688
Did you find the suspect's car?

853
00:41:56,955 --> 00:41:58,422
According to the surveillance footage,

854
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:00,230
we identified the blue van's owner.

855
00:42:00,955 --> 00:42:02,400
We're heading over shortly.

856
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,320
Alright.

857
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,039
Go back first.

858
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:06,840
Captain Han.

859
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:09,800
Director Deng has returned.

860
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,559
Can I

861
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,960
keep following this lead?

862
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,320
Chang Rui.

863
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,679
I understand how you feel,

864
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,440
but

865
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,119
don't you trust

866
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:23,679
our task force?

867
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,044
I'll let you know if we need help.

868
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,719
Alright?

869
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,400
Sure.

870
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:44,880
Hello. We're from Linshan City Police
Bureau's Anti-abduction Office.

871
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,511
Please cooperate with our investigation.

872
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:48,466
Have you seen this van?

873
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,400
That's mine.

874
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:52,719
Look here.

875
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,480
My grandson made this.

876
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,510
He put it on the car.
It's the only one nationwide.

877
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:57,977
But the license plate isn't mine.

878
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,280
Where's the car now?

879
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,960
I rented it out two days ago.

880
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,866
It's not back yet.

881
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,480
