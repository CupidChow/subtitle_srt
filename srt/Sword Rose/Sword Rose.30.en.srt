=Episode 30=

3
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,520
But unfortunately,

4
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,360
my wife passed away that year.

5
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,150
We had no children,

6
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,320
so

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,870
I wanted to adopt a child.

8
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,390
My only request

9
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,380
was

10
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,360
two moles on the sole.

11
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,640
This kind of thing

12
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,080
depends on fate.

13
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:58,822
How could it be so coincidental?

14
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,360
But later,

15
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,920
a company

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,720
actually found a child

17
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,000
at an orphanage.

18
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,430
It was Haobo.

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
I was very happy then

20
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,360
and completed the adoption.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,630
You said a company

22
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,360
helped you

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,950
find a child in an orphanage.

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,520
Do you still remember

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,230
that company's name?

26
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,270
It was Jiji Trading.

27
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,990
It was a small company then.

28
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,510
I never even met their director.

29
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,600
To thank them,

30
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,480
I gave some of our company's orders

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,990
to their company.

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,400
I admit

33
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,590
I had selfish motives

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,790
when adopting Haobo

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,110
back then.

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
But

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,390
after all these years,

38
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,160
this matter

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
has faded from my mind.

40
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,710
To me,

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
it really

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,550
doesn't matter

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,880
whether we're related by blood.

44
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,470
We're now

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,670
true father and son.

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,710
I've always kept

47
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,790
his background from him.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,040
I didn't tell him

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
because I feared

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,480
it would trouble him.

51
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
Hello.

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,790
What is it?

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Xiaoyu.

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,950
Do you remember me?

55
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,150
Xiaoyu?

56
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm Mu Haobo.

57
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:46,270
Are you sure you got the right guy?

58
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,230
You're Luo Xiaoyu.

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,790
I'm your sister.

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,160
I've searched for you for years.

61
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,160
I finally found you.

62
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
I have no sister.

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,710
Please leave.

64
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,000
No, you're Luo Xiaoyu.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,470
You have two black moles on your foot.

66
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,440
Remember?

67
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,630
Please leave.

68
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,080
Xiaoyu!

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,200
Leave, or I'll call police.

70
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,150
I'm your sister!

71
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,270
Xiaoyu!

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,710
- Xiaoyu, I didn't get the wrong guy.
- Haobo.

73
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,550
What are you doing?

74
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,110
Calm down.

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
Come here.

76
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,470
Sit here first.

77
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,560
Haobo.

78
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:21,910
I have to tell you something.

79
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
All these years,

80
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,110
there's something

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,320
I've never told you.

82
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,311
I planned to keep it from you forever.

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,000
But it now seems

84
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,590
that I must tell you.

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,400
Actually...

86
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,520
Daddy.

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't joke with me.

88
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,230
I...

89
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,910
I'm not your son?

90
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,440
You're my son,

91
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,470
but

92
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,866
we're not related by blood.

93
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,590
That young lady

94
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,590
is your birth sister.

95
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Come here.

96
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,030
Come.

97
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,640
This is your birth sister.

98
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Miss.

99
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,800
Why don't you

100
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,150
go back to Gangcheng with us?

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
You're my son's

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,360
sister,

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,350
so you're my daughter.

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,200
Haobo and I

105
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,910
will take good care of you.

106
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,710
Or

107
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,888
I can give you some money

108
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,200
as compensation.

109
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,110
Sir.

110
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,950
Thank you for taking care of my brother

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,030
for all these years.

112
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,760
I want nothing.

113
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,800
I just want to see my brother

114
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,640
grow so tall

115
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,440
and live so well.

116
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,110
I can rest assured.

117
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,760
I have only one request.

118
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,030
Go ahead.

119
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,470
Xiaoyu.

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,590
Remember.

121
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
Linshan will always be your home.

122
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,590
Director.

123
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,310
We found out that the company
that helped Mu Zhenliang find a child

124
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,088
was the same one
that Liu Gang told us about.

125
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,480
Have you checked the foreign firm?

126
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,340
Yes.

127
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,510
The local liaison
is still gathering information.

128
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,510
But they gave us

129
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,590
a very important lead.

130
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,080
This company

131
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,830
has always worked with Dingshun.

132
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,080
And very frequently.

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,470
It points to Dingshun again.

134
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,830
How long have they cooperated?

135
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,590
Since 1995.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
That was when Mu Zhenliang

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,080
came to Linshan.

138
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,600
(Dingshun.)

139
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,390
(Liu Gang.)

140
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,240
(Mu Zhenliang.)

141
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,150
(What is their connection?)

142
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,960
Yan Lei, Jiajia.

143
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,350
Go to Dingshun.

144
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,430
Check the foreign firm

145
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,760
Mu Zhenliang mentioned.

146
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,100
(Dingshun Group)

147
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,030
Sir, two officers are here.

148
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,470
Officer Yan.

149
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,320
You seem to be contacting

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,710
Dingshun a lot lately.

151
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,870
This time,

152
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,710
we want to ask

153
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,190
if Dingshun Group

154
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,240
has worked

155
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,510
with a foreign firm in Qinmang.

156
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,710
We've always
had business in Southeast Asia.

157
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,110
Is that a problem?

158
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,080
Can you provide

159
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
their relevant documents?

160
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,950
Sorry.

161
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560
I have a meeting now.

162
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,920
Zhou.

163
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,230
Assist the officers.

164
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,960
Excuse me.

165
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:04,020
(Virtue Carries All Things)

166
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,340
(Legal Representative: Ye Xiuming)

167
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:24,150
(Dingshun Group, Ye Xiuming)
Jiji Trading has worked

168
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,560
with Dingshun since 1995,

169
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,230
importing and exporting dendrobium.

170
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,550
All contracts
were signed with Ye Xiuming,

171
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,830
including Mu Zhenliang's.

172
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,710
I checked Dingshun's equity structure.

173
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,150
They changed it a few days ago.

174
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,040
Ye Xiuming is gone.

175
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,710
What a coincidence.

176
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,870
Right before Mu Zhenliang invested.

177
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,100
(Dingshun Group, Ye Xiuming,
Cooperation, Fu Haochen)

178
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,600
How could it be so coincidental?

179
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,990
Liu Gang said Cripple was someone else.

180
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,550
Could it really be Ye Xiuming?

181
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,110
Everything points to Ye Xiuming.

182
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,680
Isn't it too deliberate?

183
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,040
Who would openly commit a crime?

184
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,110
Doesn't he want a deal?

185
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,280
I'll meet him in a few days.

186
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,510
Mr. Ye.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,950
When did you come back?

188
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,920
Just now.

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,280
Sit for a while.

190
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,520
Why meet here?

191
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,890
Back

192
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,040
when I first came here,

193
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,950
I wanted to settle down

194
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,560
and build a career.

195
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,630
Zilin and I

196
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,440
lived in a cheap rental.

197
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
Later,

198
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,560
we started a small firm.

199
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,390
Oh right,

200
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,590
it was over there back then.

201
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,990
That building is abandoned now.

202
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Whenever

203
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,470
we face trouble,

204
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,040
we come to this rooftop

205
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,950
for a drink,

206
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,040
a chat,

207
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,490
to think of a way out,

208
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,950
and look at the city.

209
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,870
Then you joined the company.

210
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
The three of us

211
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,560
have built Dingshun to its size now.

212
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,590
You and Zilin are the ones I trust most.

213
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,360
Without your help,

214
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,590
I could never have succeeded.

215
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,630
I've been reflecting these days.

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,160
I shouldn't have
insisted on the tech firm.

217
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
I plan to return.

218
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,080
Let's fight side by side

219
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,990
and work as one again.

220
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
Mr. Ye.

221
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,920
I talked with Zilin.

222
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,160
We both think the tech firm

223
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,630
hit you hard.

224
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,400
In your current state,

225
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,511
you shouldn't run the company.

226
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,750
Mr. Ye.

227
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,280
Once I got your call,

228
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,470
I went through all past accounts.

229
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,830
Dingshun

230
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,320
did have dealings
with a company in Gangcheng.

231
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,870
But I really found nothing

232
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,520
about that Mu fellow.

233
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,750
You also know

234
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,160
that Mr. Wu has always been involved

235
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,830
in our company's financial affairs.

236
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,080
But since you trust him,

237
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,350
I can't say much.

238
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,320
Are you saying

239
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,244
he's hiding something from me?

240
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,830
I can't say for sure,

241
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,320
but you did give him too much power.

242
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,866
If he hides something from you
and tries something,

243
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,560
we can't stop him.

244
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,710
Tell me everything else

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
I don't know.

246
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,470
To be honest, Mr. Ye.

247
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,110
Mr. Wu

248
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,680
has never been pleased with me.

249
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,680
He thinks I'm on your side.

250
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,470
When the insurance case went wrong,

251
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,829
Mr. Wu used this
as an excuse to fire me.

252
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,950
Mr. Wu told me

253
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,440
it was because

254
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,350
you failed to check the insurance form.

255
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,040
That's why he fired you.

256
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,110
Mr. Ye, he tricked you.

257
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,750
That insurance company

258
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,200
was brought in by him.

259
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,240
When I spotted the problem

260
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,230
and raised it with him,

261
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,950
he claimed it was your decision.

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
Why didn't you
confirm with me back then?

263
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
Mr. Ye.

264
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,990
You were in Shencheng

265
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,320
and had no time,

266
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,350
so you let Mr. Wu handle it.

267
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,440
Is my oil painting pretty?

268
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,320
Sweetie.

269
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,120
Go nap in the room first, okay?

270
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,400
You look sleepy.

271
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,920
I'll tuck you in.

272
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,870
Madam.

273
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,800
Take her to nap first.

274
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,200
Give her to me.

275
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,320
Here.

276
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Baby, time to sleep.

277
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,750
This is a toy basket,

278
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,630
not a trash bin.

279
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,080
No need to clean it.

280
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,150
Qian

281
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,230
will play again later.

282
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,200
She just brought them out

283
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
about 20 minutes ago.

284
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,950
Why clean it up?

285
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,750
It's pointless.

286
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,040
The mess bothers me.

287
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,990
You're at home every day,

288
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,750
either drinking or watching TV.

289
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,630
You keep getting wasted.

290
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Don't you feel awful?

291
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,630
It's been over ten years.

292
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,040
I've only relaxed for a few days.

293
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,040
Isn't life

294
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,280
about being happy?

295
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,990
Wasted?

296
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,110
I wonder

297
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,230
if there's any joy left in this home.

298
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,160
I really wish

299
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,320
you'd stop drinking

300
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,990
and go out to have fun

301
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,550
with Qian and me.

302
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,390
Right?

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,360
The company is gone.

304
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,920
We can't live like this every day.

305
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,710
Everyone adjusts their mindset.

306
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,022
Let's not keep this up.

307
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,044
Pull yourself together.

308
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,990
I think I've done

309
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:21,355
a pretty good job
for this family and you

310
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:23,711
over the past few decades.

311
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,280
Even if you disagree,

312
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,680
I still believe

313
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,920
I'm no less than Wu Bin

314
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,110
or anyone else.

315
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,800
What do you mean by that?

316
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,320
What do you mean by no less than Wu Bin?

317
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,230
What is your relationship?

318
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,040
What is my relationship with Wu Bin?

319
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,800
Why does that sound ridiculous?

320
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,670
What do you think it is?

321
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,550
Rumors in the company

322
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,000
have been going on for a long time.

323
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,560
I never believed them.

324
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,510
Have you heard?

325
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,350
Heard what?

326
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,040
Mr. Wu seems to

327
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,190
have feelings for Ms. Fang.

328
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,040
Don't talk nonsense.

329
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,160
Ms. Fang and Mr. Ye

330
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,830
have always

331
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,870
been a model couple envied by everyone.

332
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,350
How could outsiders

333
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,960
know about this?

334
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,320
Anyway,

335
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,080
Mr. Wu really takes special care of her.

336
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,900
Tell me.

337
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,080
Mr. Ye is now at a low point
in his life.

338
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,960
How will things develop

339
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,390
among the three of them?

340
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,480
You're right.

341
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,190
What else do you know?

342
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,630
But now,

343
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:54,160
given the current situation,

344
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,400
I want to hear you explain

345
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,088
what's going on between you two.

346
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
You believe

347
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
the gossip from colleagues

348
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
in the company

349
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,000
and even question me.

350
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,080
You know very well

351
00:18:12,311 --> 00:18:14,222
that the employees
always hide behind the door

352
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,150
to eavesdrop

353
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,310
whenever we have meetings.

354
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,030
They don't know the truth yet,

355
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,190
so they go out and gossip.

356
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,550
You believe them instead of me?

357
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,890
It's not that I don't believe you.

358
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,160
I believe only facts.

359
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,590
Facts?

360
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,240
The fact is the company is gone.

361
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,844
And this family will also be gone soon.

362
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:30,480
I never thought

363
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
you two would join forces to betray me!

364
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,270
Wu Bin and I join forces to betray you?

365
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,110
Yes!

366
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,800
Now,

367
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,670
you two have kicked me out.

368
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,110
You won!

369
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,133
How did you become like this?

370
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,550
Hearing you say this

371
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,150
really breaks my heart.

372
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,280
Didn't you say

373
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,350
it's alright to cut you off?

374
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:54,488
You could get listed companies
to invest in you again.

375
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,800
Weren't those your words?

376
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,510
Didn't I warn you

377
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,720
repeatedly not to do it?

378
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,240
I said we worked hard

379
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
to build this company from scratch.

380
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,760
You didn't listen...

381
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,000
How is it now that he and I

382
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,480
kicked you out?

383
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,880
What do you mean we won?

384
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,920
Isn't this family

385
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,960
ours together?

386
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,080
Is it yours or mine alone?

387
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,910
Just keep getting wasted.

388
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:20,888
At the end of the day,

389
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,720
your ability

390
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,520
doesn't match your ambition.

391
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,300
(Missing Person)

392
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:19,740
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

393
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,340
(Missing Person)

394
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,000
Xiaoyu...

395
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
Sister.

396
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,560
I'm back.

397
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,590
Xiaoyu.

398
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,190
I found you.

399
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,740
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

400
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,300
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

401
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,400
Liu Gang.

402
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,430
Figure out your current situation.

403
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,560
What right do you have
to bargain with us?

404
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,670
I told you

405
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,800
I'll only talk to you alone.

406
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,760
Wait for me in the next room.

407
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,840
Speak.

408
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,970
What do you want to tell me?

409
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,960
Turn that off.

410
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,000
I have something important to tell you.

411
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,910
I promise

412
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,110
you'll want to know what I have to say.

413
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,750
You asked me to turn it off.

414
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,350
This was already recorded.

415
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,520
You bear the consequences yourself.

416
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,240
Can you speak now?

417
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,320
I want to

418
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,430
make a deal with you.

419
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,560
What deal?

420
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,350
I can tell you

421
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,960
Cripple's true identity.

422
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,590
Why didn't you tell us before?

423
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,040
This is my lifeline.

424
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,760
How could I tell you easily?

425
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,480
I

426
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,760
have to trade it for something.

427
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,190
What do you want?

428
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,830
Clear my charges

429
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,110
and get me out of here.

430
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,190
This is not a market.

431
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,590
You want to bargain with me?

432
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,430
Why not let me serve your time too?

433
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,520
Ye Xiuming.

434
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,480
Ye Xiuming is Cripple.

435
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,390
If I remember right,

436
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,000
Ye Xiuming is your cousin.

437
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,480
All these years,

438
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,630
he

439
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,080
always ordered me around
from behind the scenes,

440
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,590
but I'm not stupid.

441
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,590
I still found some clues.

442
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,430
Guess what.

443
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,266
I found my orders came from Dingshun.

444
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,240
Whose company is Dingshun?

445
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,150
You know better than me.

446
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,555
There are so many people in Dingshun.

447
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,070
How can you prove

448
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,590
Ye Xiuming is Cripple?

449
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,320
I delivered a child to Fu Haochen,

450
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,320
and Dingshun got a 30 million deal.

451
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,400
Ye Xiuming gained the most.

452
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,270
If not him,

453
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,240
then who is Cripple?

454
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,390
Officer Deng.

455
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,490
No.

456
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,350
Director Deng.

457
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,800
Linshan's

458
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,190
biggest trafficker is your cousin.

459
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,240
Can you keep your position as director

460
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,910
of Anti-abduction Office?

461
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,560
How about this?

462
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,830
I'll keep your secret.

463
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,920
You clear my charges

464
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,870
and get me out.

465
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,350
We'll both win.

466
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,950
Officer Deng.

467
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,910
Today,

468
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,320
I've made myself very clear.

469
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,280
You know

470
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,520
better than me how to choose.

471
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,110
(I've made myself very clear.)

472
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
(You know)

473
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,560
(better than me how to choose.)

474
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Deng Yan.

475
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,760
Stay out of this case

476
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,480
for the time being.

477
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,150
Chief Xiao.

478
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,790
I think we still need to verify

479
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,350
Liu Gang's statement.

480
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,520
What do you think?

481
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,910
Chang Rui.

482
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,110
You're now in charge of this case.

483
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,560
Report to Captain Han and me directly.

484
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,010
I think it's here.

485
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,870
I guess so.

486
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,720
Let's play with the doggy toy.

487
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,480
You can squat to look.

488
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,240
Look at the doggy.

489
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,080
Hello.

490
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,280
Who are you here for?

491
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,390
We're from Anti-abduction Office.

492
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,870
Is Ye Xiuming at home?

493
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,670
He's not home now.

494
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,630
Are you Deng Yan's colleagues?

495
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,330
Yes.

496
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,480
Can you reach him?

497
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,280
We need to ask him something.

498
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,350
Sure.

499
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,510
Sir.

500
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,070
The company you had me follow up on

501
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,040
is quite new,

502
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,110
but its record is quite clean.

503
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,200
We're now

504
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,800
speeding up the contract process.

505
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,000
It will take about three weeks.

506
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,080
One week.

507
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,555
Finish all contract procedures

508
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,320
within one week,

509
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,720
Yes, Sir.

510
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,350
(Dingshun Group)

511
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,180
Sir.

512
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,030
The two Qinmang companies you mentioned

513
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,280
had done a lot,

514
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,630
but they're
not closely related to our company.

515
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,560
So I think we need to reconsider.

516
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,350
Reconsider what?

517
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,670
Did the company hire you to think?

518
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,520
We hired you to act.

519
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,440
Yes, Sir.

520
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,430
We'll speed it up.

521
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,980
Sir.

522
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,030
The three companies I reported before

523
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,280
have excellent credentials

524
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,150
and are willing to work with us,

525
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,750
but deciding which one to choose

526
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,320
still needs more thought.

527
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,110
All three are willing to work with us?

528
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,240
Yes.

529
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,630
Their funds and background are clean?

530
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,670
Yes.

531
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,590
Here's the thing.

532
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
The company is financially strong,

533
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,240
so I think

534
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,720
we don't need to work with just one.

535
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,200
Talk to all three.

536
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,280
Got it.

537
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,440
Sir.

538
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,670
The ones I contacted...

539
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,040
Hello?

540
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,350
Wu Bin.

541
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,960
I already

542
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:31,200
found out about some things.

543
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,630
Let's meet.

544
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,390
I still hope

545
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,910
we can talk face to face.

546
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,133
See you at the same place.

547
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,950
Okay.

548
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,480
No problem.

549
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,460
Sorry.

550
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
The number you dialed is temporarily...

551
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,320
I can't get through.

552
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,520
Hello, Wu?

553
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,830
Is Xiuming with you?

554
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,320
Nothing.

555
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,560
Well...

556
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,630
Okay, I'll hang up.

557
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,100
(Dingshun Group)

558
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,900
Sir.

559
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,190
The contracts with the foreign companies

560
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,430
I've contacted are now underway.

561
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,560
I'll sort out the details

562
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,830
and report at tomorrow's meeting.

563
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,510
Do you
have other instructions or requests?

564
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,720
Let me know.

565
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,590
I'll sort them out

566
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,830
and report tomorrow as well.

567
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,670
Hello, Dong?

568
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,350
Is Xiuming with you?

569
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,720
No?

570
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,250
Okay then.

571
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,440
If you see him,

572
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,430
call me.

573
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Bye.

574
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,200
Strange. If he's not at home,

575
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,670
he usually finds those two friends.

576
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,590
It's okay. Don't worry yet.

577
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,190
Maybe you'll get news soon.

578
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,040
Okay.

579
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
How is Xiuming's IT company

580
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
in Shencheng doing?

581
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,520
Not well.

582
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,590
It closed down.

583
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,960
What has he been doing lately?

584
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,870
Staying at home.

585
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,110
He's not doing much.

586
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,430
He's not in a good mood.

587
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,390
Sometimes he drinks.

588
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,390
He's demotivated.

589
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,590
Do you take part
in Dingshun's operations?

590
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,430
I used to be very involved.

591
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,270
After having a child,

592
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,560
I spent more time and energy

593
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,000
on keeping her company.

594
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,750
Most matters are now

595
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,960
handled by Mr. Wu.

596
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,380
Okay.

597
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,720
If Xiuming comes back

598
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,160
or you contact him,

599
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,150
inform us immediately.

600
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,560
What's wrong with Xiuming?

601
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,040
It's still under investigation.

602
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:11,355
Thanks for your cooperation.

604
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,030
Ye Xiuming disappeared.

605
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,830
No one around him can reach him.

606
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,150
It's not even 24 hours yet.

607
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,390
It's too early for such a conclusion.

608
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,960
Did Fang Zilin

609
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,133
deliberately keep
Ye Xiuming's whereabouts from us?

610
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,800
I don't think so.

611
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,444
Congratulations on your promotion, Wu.

612
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:42,270
Congratulations.

613
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,240
Come on, bottoms up.

614
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,520
Mr. Wu.

615
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,720
Now that you're the chairman,

616
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,430
look after us.

617
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,480
Here.

618
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,350
I

619
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,720
wish you
continuous promotion and success.

620
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,150
May you soar to great heights
across the whole country.

621
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You first call me Mr. Wu.

622
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,190
Then call me a chairman.

623
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,800
So what am I exactly?

624
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,480
Mr. Wu can only help you with this.

625
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,830
A chairman can help you with that.

626
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

627
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

628
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,630
Alright.

629
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,190
Let's eat.

630
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,350
Mr. Wu.

631
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,480
That is nothing.

632
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,720
Let me show him how it's done.

633
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,240
Let me.

634
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,310
Feng, wait.

635
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,280
I will go first.

636
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,310
Mr. Wu, I'll

637
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,150
finish this.

638
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,320
Let's drink together.

639
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,400
Bottoms up.

640
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,177
Come on. Bottoms up.

641
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,000
No more.

642
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,088
The liquor is finished.

643
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:43,490
There's no way the liquor is finished.

645
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,910
Coming!

646
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,533
Bring the liquor I stored here.

647
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,870
Alright, one moment.

648
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,240
How can we drink yours?

649
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,590
Since everyone thinks so highly of me,

650
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,240
try my liquor later.

651
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,350
Tonight,

652
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:01,800
we drink till we drop.

653
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:04,488
Mr. Wu, this is the quality liquor
you stored here.

654
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,390
Zhang.

655
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,830
This food is enough.

656
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,920
We might drink longer today.

657
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,910
If you have plans,

658
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,470
head back first.

659
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,190
Enjoy your meal and drinks then, Mr. Wu.

660
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,350
Alright.

661
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,710
This liquor is clearly of high quality.

662
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,910
Here.

663
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,920
Taste it.

664
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,080
Here, a toast to you.

665
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,670
Mr. Wu, here.

666
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,750
What's wrong with him?

667
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,070
He drank too much.

668
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,520
He can't hold his liquor.

669
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,030

670
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,560

(but I'm not stupid.)

684
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,000
I still found some clues.

When you came to this company,

735

you started as a driver.

Let me tell you.

744
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,630
My success today

745
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,150
is due to my own ability!

746
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,866
Think about it.

747
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:45,280
Does Dingshun's success today
have anything to do with you?

748
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,120
Nonsense!

749
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,270
Zilin told me to trust you.

750
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,560
I gave you a chance.

751
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,040
Or you would be nothing.

752
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,560
Don't mention Zilin!

753
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,920
What have you done for her?

754
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,230
Zilin and I built Dingshun.

755
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,920
After I came to Dingshun,

756
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,310
Zilin got to live a good life!

757
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,790
When she was with you,

758
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,840
she lived in a shabby tiny room.

759
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,520
What did you give her?

760
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,000
Nothing!

761
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,920
Let me tell you, Ye Xiuming.

762
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
I'm the one providing for you now!

763
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,750
You're just a lowlife!

764

765
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,320
What do you mean?

766
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,800
I have all the evidence

767
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,750
of your crimes.

768
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,960
The insurance company
for the dendrobium order

769
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,360
that Lu Sheng handled is fake.

770
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:31,177
(You're suspected of embezzlement.)

771
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:32,130
(Signing Ceremony)

772
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,270
(To kick me out,)

773
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,670
(you brought in Mu Zhenliang,)

774
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,190
(who's skeptical of tech companies,)

775
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,560
(and diluted Zilin's shares,)

776
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,560
(seizing the chairman post.)

777
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,070
(Also,)

778
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,040
(the child you gave to Fu Haochen.)

779
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,230
(Where did you get her?)

780
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,590
Was she abducted?

781
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,488
Otherwise, why would
Anti-abduction Office investigate me?

782
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,230
Turn yourself in now.

783
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,230
You can still repent.

784
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,910
Mr. Ye.

785
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,690
Do you think

786
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,710
I would ever

787
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,000
turn myself in?

788
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,560
I'll help you repent then.

789
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:07,880
Spend

790
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,710

791
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,840
