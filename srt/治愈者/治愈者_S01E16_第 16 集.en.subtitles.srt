1
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,466
I'm Choi Myeong-hui.

2
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,552
-Do you remember me?
-Yes, of course. Hello.

3
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,512
Are you free? I would like to meet you.

4
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,557
Of course. I'm completely free.

5
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,434
When should I come see you?

6
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,104
At your home?

7
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,315
No. I can get there myself.

8
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,780
Actually, I didn't expect
that you would contact me.

9
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,531
Thank you.

10
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,824
I'll see you later.

11
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,419
Ms. Chae Yeong-sin?

12
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,298
Yes, that's me.

13
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,591
This way, please.

14
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,435
Do you remember me?

15
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,687
Yes. Hello.

16
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,606
My wife called, right?

17
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,399
Yes, just now.

18
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,610
Let's go. I'll give you a lift.

19
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,154
That's not necessary.

20
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,448
Get in.

21
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,954
Okay then. Thank you.

22
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,130
You don't drive?

23
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,884
No. I don't fear anything at all,

24
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,804
but strangely, I'm afraid of driving.

25
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,725
I think I was traumatized
when I was a child or something.

26
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:29,065
Sometimes, I have dreams
about cars racing down a dark street.

27
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,277
Shall we go now?

28
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,448
Yes, but drive slowly.

29
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,742
We shouldn't scare Reporter Chae.

30
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,202
Right.

31
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,483
-We're not open yet.
-Is Mr. Kim Yong-woon here?

32
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,282
CHIEF OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN 1992

33
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,335
Sir.

34
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,755
You were the chief of
Criminal Investigations in 1992

35
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,131
at the Sokcho Precinct, right?

36
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,968
He stays in his room like that all day.
He doesn't talk to people.

37
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,762
Do you remember being a detective?

38
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,764
Sir.

39
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,075
While you were at the station,

40
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,953
you questioned a man
named Seo Jun-seok, didn't you?

41
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,873
Do you remember?

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't you remember?

43
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,921
Seo Jun-seok
you met at Sokcho Police Station in 1992.

44
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,802
Seo...

45
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,179
Jun-seok.

46
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,932
Yes, Seo Jun-seok. Do you remember?

47
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,350
Seo Jun-seok.

48
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,688
We lost our badges because of him.

49
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,773
What happened?

50
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,316
Seo Jun-seok.

51
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,194
I lost my badge because of him.

52
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,196
He means he lost his job.

53
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,739
Was it in 1992?

54
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,408
That's right.

55
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,910
That's when they were all kicked out.

56
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,955
Do you remember what happened in 1992?

57
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,293
My family was forced out to the streets
because he got fired.

58
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,460
Of course, I remember.

59
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,382
Your father said "we" just now.

60
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,343
Does he mean there were others

61
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,220
who lost their badges?

62
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,723
It's Park Dong-cheol.

63
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,933
The other person who was fired
because of my father.

64
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,561
He remembered that name?

65
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,896
You can find him now, right?

66
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,606
Am I a vending machine?

67
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,358
You insert your coin and I dispense it?

68
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,987
I heard Yeong-sin knows
the face of that vending machine.

69
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,282
Goodness, I worked with you
for eight years,

70
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,701
and all I got is that ridiculous picture
of a desert.

71
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,747
I was enraged when she said
that you went to see her.

72
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,254
Good morning.

73
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,547
-You're in early.
-Right.

74
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,633
Yeong-sin just called.
She's interviewing Choi Myeong-hui.

75
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,805
You know, the wife of the person
you wish weren't your brother.

76
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,474
So, it's your sister-in-law...

77
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,853
Of course you know her name.
I'll be going then.

78
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,485
ANONYMOUS WOMAN

79
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,786
Kim Mun-ho speaking.

80
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,165
I always monitor the location
of Chae Yeong-sin's phone,

81
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,836
and she just arrived
at a location I don't like.

82
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,839
I considered calling Healer,

83
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,218
but he keeps exposing his face everywhere.

84
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,888
If I tell him, he'll insist on
running right over there.

85
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,681
That will be a pain in the neck.

86
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,478
You know, Reporter Chae,

87
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,439
you have natural talent for this.

88
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,693
-I'm not sure about that.
-Your broadcast yesterday was remarkable.

89
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,406
Honestly, I paid more attention to you
than to my brother.

90
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,328
But sir.

91
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,791
I'm late for my appointment
with your wife and...

92
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,438
Ma'am.

93
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,523
Don't worry.

94
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,985
I already let her know,
so you don't need to call her again.

95
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,121
I know you're busy,
so I'll get to the point.

96
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,747
Okay.

97
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,334
First, I would like you to postpone

98
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,420
meeting my wife.

99
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,590
May I ask why?

100
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:50,011
I heard there is a dangerous person
in your vicinity.

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,930
-Pardon?
-Do you know Seo Jeong-hu?

102
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,729
-Who?
-Maybe you don't know him after all.

103
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,691
Then, is Mun-ho the only one
who knows him?

104
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
If you could give me a hint...

105
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,614
I...

106
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,910
had a group of close friends in college.

107
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,498
This is me, my wife Myeong-hui,

108
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,791
and...

109
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,045
this is my friend, Seo Jun-seok.

110
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,672
He's Seo Jeong-hu's father.

111
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,886
He was the first Healer.
His name is Yeong-jae.

112
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,680
He died recently.

113
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,352
I saw Yeong-jae before he died,

114
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,354
and he said he made

115
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,148
Jun-seok's son, Jeong-hu,

116
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,150
the next Healer.

117
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,656
Do you know anything
about people called "Night Messengers"?

118
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,576
Roughly, yes.

119
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,081
They do all sorts of dirty jobs for money.

120
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,919
But the first Healer, Yeong-jae,
had standards.

121
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,212
However...

122
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,798
that boy, Jeong-hu

123
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,343
began to cross the line.

124
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,471
What do you mean by crossing the line?

125
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,393
-Is Manager Ahn here?
-Yes, he's waiting.

126
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,103
Tell him to come in.

127
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,355
There's someone I would like you to meet.

128
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,733
Let me ask you something first.

129
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,443
Sure.

130
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,778
Well...

131
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,992
what am I doing here right now?

132
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,414
I think my brother Mun-ho

133
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,292
is working with Healer.

134
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,463
He's willing to break any law
to rebel against me.

135
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,259
He is like a son to me.

136
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,885
From what we have learned,

137
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,473
you're especially close with my brother.

138
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,643
Please help me before Mun-ho and Jeong-hu

139
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,645
do something worse.

140
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,406
He's Manager Ahn
of Jeil Special Investigation Team.

141
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,952
Please brief Reporter Chae.

142
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,373
She needs to be convinced
for her to take our side.

143
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,083
Okay then.

144
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,881
We've been investigating Healer
for the past month.

145
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,885
President Kim said
you'll be of great help to us.

146
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,220
Me?

147
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,564
Here is the problematic
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

148
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,399
"Problematic"?

149
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,577
We've uncovered quite a lot.

150
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,787
For example,

151
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,831
that Healer stole the videos
from Hwang Jae-guk's safe

152
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,625
and gave them to you.

153
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,585
Things like that.

154
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,511
It's been a while.

155
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,065
Did you come for Ji-an?

156
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,733
If you want to mess with anyone,
mess with me.

157
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,235
Don't play cheap.

158
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,028
I plan to make sure

159
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,156
that both Ji-an and Jeong-hu
live comfortable lives.

160
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,034
I'll train Ji-an
to become a good reporter,

161
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,702
and I'll have Jeong-hu turn himself in.

162
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,622
I'll find him a good lawyer

163
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,417
and get the lightest sentence possible.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,460
He needs to return to society.

165
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,586
Why?

166
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,548
Why would you do anything for them?

167
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,465
I am...

168
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,761
their fathers' friend.

169
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,307
There isn't much that you can do for them.

170
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,311
At most, you'll be a reporter for the
Internet news, or...

171
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,232
will you continue your petty theft?

172
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,984
Did you just say, "friend"?

173
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,749
Last November,

174
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:35,463
Healer was hired to get an item
from Ko Seong-cheol,

175
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,965
and the next day,
Ko Seong-cheol was found dead.

176
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,634
The police named Healer
as the prime suspect.

177
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,679
Healer stole video files
from Hwang Jae-guk's safe,

178
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,973
and two days later,
Hwang Jae-guk was found dead.

179
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,308
HWANG JAE-GUK AND HEALER MEET

180
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,059
His death was concluded as a suicide.

181
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,646
There were strong arguments
within the police department

182
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,231
that it was a murder case,

183
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,276
and Healer was the prime suspect.

184
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,783
The second Healer's father, Seo Jun-seok,

185
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,785
was also a murderer.

186
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:11,624
In 1992, he killed his friend, Oh Gil-han.

187
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,875
OH GIL-HAN, MURDERED

188
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:15,961
Do you have any more questions?

189
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,316
Who's calling?

190
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:43,280
You said to call if someone comes
asking about Seo Jun-seok.

191
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,573
That's why I called.

192
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,409
Yes, I told him about Park Dong-cheol.

193
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,121
When will you send me the money?
Do you need my account number?

194
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,588
He took the bait we planted
in Jangan-dong.

195
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,177
I came to get you.

196
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,864
What is it?

197
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,033
President Kim Mun-sik

198
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,828
thinks Seo Jeong-hu is Healer.

199
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,084
He also thinks
you've teamed up with Healer.

200
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,629
It's true. I did team up with him.

201
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,172
President Kim Mun-sik

202
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,091
is someone in a very high position,

203
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,469
but...

204
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,056
he still came to my house to pick me up.

205
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,224
And...

206
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,436
he told me all those things.

207
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,858
You also have a high position.
You're our president after all.

208
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,195
But...

209
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,158
you came all the way here to get me
during working hours.

210
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:54,912
Why?

211
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,883
When I first met Healer...

212
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968
I mean...

213
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,805
when I first met Jeong-hu,

214
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,849
he took my nail clipping.

215
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,394
You said

216
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,896
you hired him to do that.

217
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,065
Why?

218
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,984
I was going to tell you at some point.

219
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:26,902
When?

220
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,196
I guess this is the time, right?

221
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,122
I never thought it would be
in some underground parking lot.

222
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,209
Yeong-sin.

223
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,630
Your biological mother is alive.

224
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,848
My sister-in-law,

225
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,559
whom you tried to meet today
but couldn't...

226
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,604
Choi Myeong-hui is your mom.

227
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,689
And your name is...

228
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:06,942
Oh Ji-an.

229
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,701
What is this? I...

230
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,287
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

231
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,748
I had a good reason. Actually...

232
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,378
I was too scared.

233
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,466
That's why I kept delaying it.

234
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,979
Are you okay, Ji-an?

235
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,153
What are you saying?

236
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,657
You're not making any sense.

237
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,960
KING KARAOKE BAR

238
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,631
I found it, but...

239
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,884
this place looks shady.

240
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,594
I have a bad feeling too.

241
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,598
We found a cop who quit 22 years ago,

242
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,850
and we got an answer within hours.

243
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,602
This isn't possible.

244
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,146
I feel very uneasy about this.

245
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,233
But what can we do?
We have no other choice.

246
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,819
We'll have to turn a trap into a path.

247
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,791
What is it?

248
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,962
I heard that Park Dong-cheol is here.

249
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,297
-Who?
-Park Dong-cheol.

250
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:53,882
Can't you hear me?

251
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,636
Park Dong-cheol.

252
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,373
Aren't you going to answer me?

253
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,085
Tell me whether he's here,
or that you don't know.

254
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,589
Wait for a moment.

255
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,605
How long should I wait?

256
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,859
I really hate waiting.

257
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,781
Park Dong-cheol.

258
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,243
You know him, right?

259
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,209
Enjoy.

260
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,539
-He said to wait.
-For what?

261
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,958
Get rid of him and open for business.

262
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,544
You asked for Park Dong-cheol, right?

263
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,887
The Park Dong-cheol I'm looking for
should be much older.

264
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,097
Let's go. We'll take you to him.

265
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,598
Liar.

266
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,392
Come with us while I'm being nice.

267
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,853
CHAE YEONG-SIN

268
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,231
I need to take this. Hold on.

269
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,194
-What took you so long to call?
-Talk about manners.

270
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,201
Were you busy? I called three times.

271
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,664
I met Kim Mun-sik this morning.

272
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,001
What? Why did you see that jerk? He's...

273
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,711
He knows you're Healer.

274
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,715
Don't bother.

275
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,051
Are you with someone?

276
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,222
No, I'm just cleaning. So what happened?

277
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,435
He says you're bad and dangerous.

278
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,064
What was Kim Mun-ho doing?
Why didn't he stop you?

279
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,150
Kim Mun-ho apologized

280
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,862
for not telling me about
my biological mother.

281
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,199
For not telling me

282
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,827
even when he knew about her.

283
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,793
Yeong-sin.

284
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,050
I'll call you back.

285
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,978
I'm in a rush. Can't you just tell me?

286
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,606
You know Park Dong-cheol, don't you?

287
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,249
You were right. It was a trap.

288
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,543
But they're not Sang-su's men.

289
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,588
I put a tracker on their car,
so take care of it.

290
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,215
It's definitely him.

291
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,052
Boss said to bring him,
so don't make any mistakes.

292
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,888
Move to the next point. Quickly.

293
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,890
PARK BONG-SU

294
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,040
She was in a bad car accident in 1992.

295
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,460
Her condition is as you read in the news.

296
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,636
Here are your mom's medical records
and the doctor's notes.

297
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,686
She needs absolute rest,

298
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,606
and she has symptomatic epilepsy,

299
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,359
brain damage, and depression.

300
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,363
I don't understand any of this.

301
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,077
If she is under a lot of pressure,
she has seizures.

302
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,497
If the seizures persist,
the brain can't get enough oxygen

303
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,168
which can result in brain damage
and brain hemorrhage.

304
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,463
The worst-case scenario,
she may become brain-dead.

305
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,216
Your mom improved significantly,

306
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,344
but she goes into shock
whenever your name is mentioned.

307
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,390
She lives for two days a year,
your birthday and the day of your death.

308
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,731
Don't you remember anything?

309
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,941
You were five when--

310
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,195
The only thing I remember is a highway.

311
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,405
A highway?

312
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,412
I was standing on the side
of a highway that night.

313
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,788
That's all.

314
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,376
I have no memories before that.

315
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,837
So...

316
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,381
is this everything?

317
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,218
A few pictures
and a few pages of a doctor's notes?

318
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,094
I hope you understand

319
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,013
that I couldn't tell you sooner

320
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,307
because I wanted to keep your mom alive.

321
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,936
It's easy

322
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,480
to understand.

323
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,567
I still have a mom.

324
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,071
However, she will die

325
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,156
if I tell her I'm her daughter.

326
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,408
-That's right.
-But...

327
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,410
why didn't you tell me?

328
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,412
I could have...

329
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,708
simply pretended not to know.

330
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,970
Aren't you going to answer that?

331
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,847
Why did she abandon me?

332
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,849
-She lost you.
-Why didn't she look for me?

333
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,018
They were told that you were dead.

334
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,398
-I have so much to tell you--
-Did Jeong-hu know about my mom?

335
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,651
I wouldn't let him tell you.
I asked him to wait.

336
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,029
Jeong-hu wasn't on my side.

337
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,698
Would you hear me out first?

338
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,116
Forget it.

339
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,035
I'll look into it myself.

340
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,412
Ji-an.

341
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,006
I'll look into it and see
if there's anything I need to know.

342
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,091
Because you can't trust me?

343
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,010
No.

344
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,886
Sorry.

345
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,017
And I'm Chae Yeong-sin.

346
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,979
I'm not Ji-eun, or Ji-yeon,
or whatever it is.

347
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,609
Ji-an.

348
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:03,913
When I walked into the alley

349
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,541
DELETED FAMILY CENSUS REGISTER
OH GIL-HAN

350
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,586
The second Healer's father, Seo Jun-seok,

351
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,254
was also a murderer.

352
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:58,551
In 1992, he killed his friend, Oh Gil-han.

353
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:15,276
You can't suddenly say no, sir.
It will only take an hour.

354
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,447
What am I supposed to do then?
Everyone is waiting!

355
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,700
-Hey!
-This isn't it!

356
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,787
You only need to cut and paste
the essential part of the interview.

357
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,498
What is this, diarrhea?
Why is it so runny?

358
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,582
Cut out the beginning.

359
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,501
-All of it?
-Should I cut you instead?

360
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,460
I'll cut it.

361
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,047
-What should I do?
-What?

362
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,801
-This isn't enough, sir.
-Shut it!

363
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,844
This is Someday News.

364
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,929
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin left early today.

365
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:47,434
The entire staff is suffering from
work overload and totally stressed,

366
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,060
but she silently disappeared.

367
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,271
I think she was dumped pretty bad.

368
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,272
Thank you.

369
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,873
Kim Mun-sik will push forward
with an image of integrity.

370
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,709
-So, for this part...
-Yes?

371
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,129
Regarding his political funding...

372
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,012
Should I look into it more?

373
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,015
-I need to take this. Let's talk later.
-Okay.

374
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,606
Hey, Myeong-hui.

375
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,484
Sorry if you're busy.
Should I call back later?

376
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,862
Don't be like that.
I'm sorry I couldn't call often.

377
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,741
When were you going to tell me
that you're now a president?

378
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,245
I'm sorry. I'm nagging already.

379
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,123
I called for a reason.

380
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,710
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin
works at your company, right?

381
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,630
Do you remember the names of
your employees?

382
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,132
We don't have many employees.
Yes, I know Chae Yeong-sin.

383
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,845
She was coming to interview me,
but she suddenly canceled.

384
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,805
Now, I can't reach her.

385
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,099
Are you no longer interviewing me?

386
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,601
I don't know.

387
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,813
May I ask the president to check for me?

388
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,106
Don't you hate doing interviews?

389
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,943
I know, right?

390
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,404
Maybe I shouldn't have agreed to do it.

391
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,032
It keeps bothering me.

392
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,827
-Myeong-hui.
-Yes?

393
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,578
Chae Yeong-sin...

394
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,543
She is going through personal hardship

395
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,962
so asking her to go meet you

396
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,881
would just be too cruel.

397
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:43,967
"Cruel"?

398
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,844
What could be so cruel about it?

399
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,014
Don't you know that reporters nowadays
use such harsh words?

400
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,687
Do we?

401
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,280
Have a nice day.

402
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,077
-Bong-su.
-Is Yeong-sin upstairs?

403
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,245
Yeong-sin...

404
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,331
-We need to talk.
-Yes, let's talk.

405
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,749
I need to see Yeong-sin first.

406
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:32,932
Yeong-sin.

407
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,643
Are you in there?

408
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,022
Can I come in?

409
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,541
You had me so worried.

410
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,919
I was afraid you couldn't breathe.

411
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,028
Yeong-sin.

412
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:40,875
Are you angry at me?

413
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,380
Are you angry because I didn't tell you
about your mother?

414
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,844
Be angry. I'm sorry.

415
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,098
You didn't do anything wrong.

416
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,809
That isn't it.

417
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,018
If it isn't,

418
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,147
why won't you look at me?

419
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,057
Kim Mun-ho finally mustered up
the courage to tell you.

420
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,102
Did you curse him out?

421
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,440
I just listened.

422
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,567
Good job.

423
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,485
I beat him up for you.

424
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,239
But you know, Kim Mun-ho
isn't such a bad guy.

425
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,660
He didn't avoid it at all.
He just let me hit him.

426
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,501
Did you hear about...

427
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,339
your mom's health conditions?

428
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,551
I heard.

429
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,307
I met your mom.

430
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,439
Well, she seemed...

431
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,902
very nice.

432
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,821
Was it okay

433
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,408
to see her?

434
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,702
What?

435
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:42,872
Never mind.

436
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,138
DELETED FAMILY CENSUS REGISTER
OH GIL-HAN

437
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,306
Was this it?

438
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,484
It was because of what happened
between our fathers?

439
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,949
What do you mean?

440
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,200
That my father...

441
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,912
killed yours.

442
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,293
So you knew.

443
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,713
I knew.

444
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,760
I knew, but I couldn't tell you

445
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,888
in case you would react like this.

446
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,057
It has nothing

447
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,143
to do with us.

448
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,352
If it has nothing to do with us,

449
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,648
why can't you look at me or hold me?

450
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,379
My father is not a murderer.
He was a suspect.

451
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,547
He may not be guilty.

452
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,757
That's why I've been looking for evidence.

453
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,094
I was going to tell you once I found it.

454
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,014
Okay.

455
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,641
I'll do that.

456
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,407
Park Bong-su, let's talk.

457
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,618
Hear me out before you go!

458
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,166
Make sure you find it.

459
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,544
Okay.

460
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,173
Come back even if you don't find it.

461
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,843
I will.

462
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,803
I'll look into it too.

463
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,932
Okay.

464
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,434
You have to come back
even if you don't find it.

465
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,356
I'll find it.

466
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,945
You're not a bad person.

467
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,449
I know.

468
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,617
We planted a tracker on Park Dong-cheol.

469
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,077
The target has not arrived yet.

470
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,205
The woman at the bar
gave him that address, right?

471
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,707
Then wait.

472
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,168
We've laid out several traps.

473
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,920
He will fall into at least one of them.

474
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,638
I'm on the move.

475
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,353
Target in sight. He's entering the alley.

476
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,736
Target confirmed.

477
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,117
Everyone move.
The mark is Park Dong-cheol.

478
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,249
Keep the target alive.

479
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,752
Do whatever you must
as soon as you find him.

480
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,435
Four o'clock direction, near the pharmacy!

481
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,831
You idiots don't stand a chance.

482
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,542
Gosh, I'm hungry.

483
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,046
I'm the best

484
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,259
I'm the best

485
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,762
I'm the best

486
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,030
You're Park Dong-cheol, right?

487
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,909
I need to ask you some questions.

488
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,122
-Are you--
-Are you Seo Jun-seok's son?

489
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,003
Wow, you scared me.

490
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,838
They said

491
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,508
Seo Jun-seok's son will come.

492
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,305
They also promised me a million won
if I contacted them.

493
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,940
I'm Seo Jun-seok's son, Seo Jeong-hu.

494
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,027
But the people you refer to...

495
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,203
You know what?

496
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,667
My life was ruined because of your father.

497
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,379
I used to be a police officer.

498
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,258
But look at me now.

499
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,737
I thought you would never return.

500
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:59,285
I can't hold a grudge.
I have no persistence.

501
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,911
Are you here to see me?

502
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,291
I heard you were working late tonight.

503
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,500
Why?

504
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,503
-I wanted to ask you something.
-What?

505
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,922
There's so much.

506
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,841
What should I ask first?

507
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,095
When I was young,

508
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,556
did I know you?

509
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:22,850
You did.

510
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,435
Were we close?

511
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,728
Very much.

512
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,939
It's been over 20 years.

513
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,983
I already forgot everything,

514
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,695
but they suddenly came looking for me.

515
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,573
It must be because of you,

516
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,742
Seo Jun-seok's son.

517
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,244
Because you've been digging things up.

518
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,245
I guess so.

519
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,206
I'm pretty shocked myself.

520
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,544
All I want is a few pages
of my father's statement,

521
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,632
but people are reacting so violently.

522
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,216
Why is that?

523
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,968
A few pages of his statement?

524
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,845
But no matter how hard I looked,

525
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,515
I couldn't find that statement anywhere.

526
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:08,354
So, I thought I should look for the person
who wrote it all down.

527
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,564
That was you, right?

528
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,485
What?

529
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,820
Is that funny?

530
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,574
Your father's statement is useless.

531
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,160
His statement was fabricated,

532
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,497
and he was forced to sign it
with his thumbprint.

533
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,415
It was fabricated?

534
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:32,795
So...

535
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,839
even if I find the statement,

536
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,718
it's a fake statement?

537
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:44,556
The statement we received was different
from the one that was submitted.

538
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,686
It was a complete work of fiction.

539
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,106
So, what did we do?

540
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,109
We reported it to Internal Affairs.

541
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,319
What do you think happened to us next?

542
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,154
I heard you were kicked out.

543
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,039
My wife left me,

544
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,375
and look what I'm doing now.

545
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:18,257
I give out flyers by day
and drive bar girls around by night.

546
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,302
And that is all

547
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,765
because of my father?

548
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:28,600
Exactly.

549
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,604
I see.

550
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,942
Look, I'm really sorry about that.

551
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,072
However, you must have heard
with your own ears.

552
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:46,410
What is it that my father said?

553
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,248
Did he say he killed a person?

554
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,541
You...

555
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,044
You really don't know anything, do you?

556
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:01,008
Your mom, dad, and Jeong-hu's dad
were reporters at the same newspaper.

557
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,217
They were very close.

558
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,430
Did Jeong-hu and I know each other too?

559
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,891
You guys cried every time you met.

560
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,809
-Because we fought?
-No.

561
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,769
Because you two didn't want to part.

562
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,316
I'm sure he cried first.

563
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,653
I wish I could remember.

564
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,655
Jeong-hu is older than you.

565
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,409
-By how much?
-A month.

566
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,702
Really?

567
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,292
And your birthday is...

568
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:39,963
tomorrow.

569
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,843
Myeong-hui is probably preparing
your birthday feast.

570
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,430
She must be baking cookies and cakes.

571
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,603
I was born in winter then.

572
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,689
I always thought I was born in March.

573
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,108
Next question.

574
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,113
Why are you

575
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,159
on such bad terms with your brother?

576
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,079
You were curious about that?

577
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,123
Your brother said that

578
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,919
you joined forces with Jeong-hu

579
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,672
and planned to commit a crime.

580
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,095
Why did he say that?

581
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,432
A few days ago, some strange men came.

582
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,104
The ones who said to call
if Seo Jun-seok's son came.

583
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,273
Yes, the million won reward.

584
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,525
So I told them

585
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:48,532
that I have a recording
of Seo Jun-seok's statement

586
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,994
and asked if they were interested.

587
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,289
How much do you want?

588
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,251
They offered me a lottery stand

589
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,920
-at a bus stop--
-Four lottery stands.

590
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:06,466
I was a cop who survived
on my sense of duty.

591
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,760
I was a real cop--

592
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,680
Fine. Tell me your price.

593
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,433
I lived my whole life like this
because of your father.

594
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,768
Can't I at least profit off of him now?

595
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,853
Sir!

596
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,106
I don't think you understand yet,

597
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,609
but they're not people you can mess with.

598
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,612
I'm not messing with them.
This is my last chance.

599
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,655
I knew this day would come.

600
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:34,661
That's why I kept that tape with me
for 22 years.

601
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,040
And look, I have two buyers now.

602
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,667
Offer me your price,

603
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:45,339
and I'll check with them and negotiate...

604
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,343
I saw someone in the exact same
situation as now.

605
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,512
A man made a deal with Kim Mun-sik.

606
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,181
Do you know what happened to him?

607
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,475
He died the next day.

608
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,102
He was poisoned
and thrown out from a train.

609
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,981
I'll give you the money,
so just give me the tape.

610
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,691
That's the only way you'll live!

611
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,086
This is Ahn of the investigation team.

612
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,172
The target just turned on his phone.

613
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,216
We're tracking him now.

614
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,052
Is Park Dong-cheol alone
or are they together?

615
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,554
We're still checking.

616
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,598
We're closing in on him.

617
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,268
Gather all the men available.

618
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,939
If that kid is Healer as I assume,
he will be quite a fighter.

619
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,357
But sir,

620
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:31,194
what is the priority
given the worst-case scenario?

621
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,448
Is it acquiring Seo Jun-seok's
statement tape

622
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,951
or is it taking care of Seo Jeong-hu?

623
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:42,247
Boss will be mad if he finds out
that the tape exists.

624
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,833
We have to make sure
it doesn't see the light of day.

625
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,590
I'll take you home.

626
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,426
It's okay, I can still ride the bus
at this hour.

627
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,721
Why can't you ever say yes to anything?

628
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,598
Are you afraid of my car or something?

629
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:10,984
Hey, Myeong-hui.

630
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,448
You know Jeong-hu, right? Jun-seok's son.

631
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,534
I think he's in danger.

632
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,205
What should I do?

633
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,998
Call Jeong-hu.

634
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,627
Did you hear where he was?
Did they mention his location?

635
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,309
CHAE YEONG-SIN

636
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,277
I knew you would call tonight.

637
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,578
She heard Kim Mun-sik on the phone.

638
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,581
People are headed toward you to catch you.

639
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,333
Get out of there now.

640
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:17,801
You'll be there in 12 or 13 minutes
at that speed.

641
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,303
Stop the car when you reach
the church's back door.

642
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,222
I'll send the police
at an appropriate time.

643
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:35,527
Are they tracking this phone to find us?

644
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,864
I told you, didn't I?
This is my last chance.

645
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,365
I had no choice.

646
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,497
The phone's been turned off.
He must have caught on.

647
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,040
He's in a church, right?

648
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,960
How long before you arrive?

649
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,673
The most important thing is...

650
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,428
the tape of my father's statement.

651
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:06,099
Do you really have it,
or is that a fake too?

652
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:10,020
I have it. I kept it for over 20 years.

653
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,899
The deal they made
was to hand over that tape and me?

654
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,360
For what? A lottery stand?

655
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,487
They will give me a job
as a security guard.

656
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,119
Let's go for now. Let's get out of here.

657
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,124
Jeong-hu, consider it
as paying your father's debt.

658
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,334
Look, old man!

659
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,503
Those people won't let you live!

660
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,297
They're giving me
health and life insurance too.

661
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,466
Okay, fine.

662
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,718
Then just tell me this.

663
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,845
My father...

664
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,557
never killed anyone, right?

665
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,936
I need to know this.

666
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,230
You're the only one who can tell me,

667
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:58,652
so please tell me. Please!

668
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,446
Later. I'll tell you everything later.

669
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,073
When those people come...

670
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,546
Sir!

671
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,673
Sir! Wake up!

672
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,595
Sir! You have to tell me!

673
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:17,350
My father... Did he...

674
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,357
You can't do this to me.

675
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,025
Please, sir.

676
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,114
Sir.
