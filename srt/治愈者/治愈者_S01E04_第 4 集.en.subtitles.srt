1
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,404
You're awake, right?

2
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,739
Your heart rate indicates
that you're awake.

3
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,660
You're nocturnal.
Why are you up with everyone else?

4
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,460
Are you really going to work
at the newspaper company?

5
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,424
You may end up rotting in prison,
you stubborn little mule.

6
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,800
I told you not to do it, didn't I?

7
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:04,434
Working in a company with other people
means your face will be exposed.

8
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:11,024
The more people remember your face,
the riskier it is for you.

9
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,191
Don't you know that?

10
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,698
Let's lie low for just three months.

11
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,702
The detectives will move on
after three months.

12
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,954
It will soon become
an unsolved case, so...

13
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,247
You stubborn mule.

14
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:29,918
Ms. Jo.

15
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,046
Detectives are always busy.
They have plenty of other cases.

16
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,050
That girl, Chae Yeong-sin,
is the perfect bait.

17
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,636
It feels like winter.

18
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,597
The fish is definitely nibbling.

19
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,557
I need to find out if this fish

20
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,893
is the one who killed Ko Seong-cheol
and framed me for it,

21
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:51,689
or if there is someone hiding
behind this fish.

22
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,567
It will take four days at most.

23
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,029
If I don't catch anything by then,
I'll leave right away.

24
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,699
What do you think?

25
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,826
Do I look like Reporter Park Bong-su now?

26
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,996
Goodness.

27
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,542
Lose the glasses.

28
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,878
Your bare face is your disguise.

29
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,089
Okay.

30
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,093
Don't let them see who you really are.

31
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,929
Don't do anything to stand out.

32
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,723
If someone curses you, just listen.

33
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,350
If someone hits you, just get hit!

34
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,066
If a superior gives you orders,
always answer, "Yes."

35
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,777
Yes?

36
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,447
You will write 60 articles a day.

37
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,740
You will do it quickly.

38
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,660
Write articles?

39
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,081
You want me to write
60 newspaper articles every day?

40
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,500
Me?

41
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,043
Here.

42
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,965
-Do you see these live issues?
-Yes.

43
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,092
Write articles using these search terms.

44
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,429
Write 6 articles for each search term,
a total of 60 newspaper articles.

45
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,890
You can copy piece by piece
from other articles.

46
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,768
Come up with headlines that can
grab people's attention.

47
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,978
End of training.

48
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,276
Chief, I wrote two versions
of the article.

49
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,570
One is catchy, and the other is sexy.

50
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,156
Just choose whichever you prefer.

51
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,240
Please take a look.

52
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,742
This is awesome.

53
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,246
Please publish it. Just once.

54
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:36,127
If you want it to be published so much,
just post it on your blog.

55
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,380
You know I don't do things like that.

56
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,840
Really?

57
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,176
Let's use this opportunity
to create a blog then.

58
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,344
What would be a good title for your blog?

59
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,307
I have one.
"Reporter Chae Yeong-sin's Vomit."

60
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,561
What is this? Are you scared, chief?

61
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,940
You are scared.

62
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,820
You want me to catch celebrities like mice
and squeeze information out of them,

63
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,989
but you're scared
because this is a politician.

64
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,994
Hey.

65
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,956
Do you think this is even
worth getting scared about?

66
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,375
Look at this. Look.

67
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,252
She's not a star.

68
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,130
She's only an actress-in-training
who was raped once.

69
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,257
-She wasn't just--
-But...

70
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,511
she neither committed suicide
nor was she murdered.

71
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,930
How is this newsworthy?

72
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,892
Are you saying that
you will only get interested

73
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,560
if someone dies?

74
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,687
Of course. Yes.

75
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,817
Wow, Chief Jang Byeong-se.
Where are your morals?

76
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,487
When you go home
and your kids call you "Daddy,"

77
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,863
won't you feel ashamed?

78
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,368
Watch your mouth.
You're walking on thin ice.

79
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,413
All due respect, chief. Please...

80
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,502
Please let me sleep.

81
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,339
You can't go to sleep
if I don't publish this?

82
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,591
Are you too fired up
with a sense of justice?

83
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,926
No.

84
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,304
This actress-in-training
who tried to kill herself

85
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,557
is staying in my house.

86
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,600
More precisely, in my room,
next to my bed.

87
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,810
So?

88
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,272
I can't sleep when someone
is in the same room.

89
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,190
It's been days now. I'm going crazy.

90
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,569
That's why this article
needs to be published,

91
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,280
so she can take it to the police
and not threaten,

92
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,657
but pressure them to start investigating.

93
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,952
And once that starts,
we can keep her mind off of suicide.

94
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,370
That means I can send her back home,

95
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,457
and I will finally
be able to get some sleep.

96
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,749
Do you understand?

97
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,129
-Yeong-sin.
-Yes, chief?

98
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,883
Kim Ui-chan is a Seoul mayoral candidate.

99
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,009
We can't use his real name.

100
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,679
We can call him "K".
Let's use his initial.

101
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:56,601
The only real name we can use is hers.
Do you want to just use her name?

102
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,603
-That's not fair.
-Exactly.

103
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,146
So, don't do it.

104
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,690
And you, get over here. Come here.

105
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,943
-My ear! Watch it!
-Shut it.

106
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,111
You.

107
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,530
Just focus on training
your junior assistant, got it?

108
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,115
Good day.

109
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,575
Come one, chief.

110
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,285
Darn it.

111
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,709
You better move away from me now.

112
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,720
You piece of trash copy machine!

113
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,138
You punk! You jerk!

114
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,476
You worthless piece of scrap!
We need to throw this out.

115
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,778
What the...

116
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,133
I'll hold on to your phone for you.

117
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,514
We can't risk the conversation
in this room being recorded or leaked.

118
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,724
That's the rule.

119
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,317
Search thoroughly.

120
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,028
I'm actually hiding a gun.

121
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,375
-Hey, Mun-ho.
-Mun-ho.

122
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,586
I'm a fan of yours.

123
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,797
Do you know how much
we wanted to meet you?

124
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,884
Wow, you're much better looking in person.

125
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,720
It's nice to meet you.

126
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,683
My brother said he would cut my allowance
if I didn't come.

127
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,648
It's an honor to meet everyone
who works behind the scenes.

128
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,154
Mun-ho, here. This way.

129
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,780
Well...

130
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,365
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

131
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,370
We invited a chef from France.

132
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,957
He came in first in some cooking contest.

133
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,125
He's good.

134
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,045
I'm scared that big names like you

135
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,132
invited a no-name reporter like me
for dinner.

136
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,136
May I first ask what this is about?

137
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,348
You're indeed a reporter.

138
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,808
You're different from politicians.

139
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,976
See?

140
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,520
He seeks facts straight off the bat.

141
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,940
What could those facts be?

142
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,984
Here is the fact.

143
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:56,113
We've picked you, Mun-ho.

144
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,327
They want to throw you
into the political ring.

145
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,828
Not me.

146
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:07,124
I want you to come to my company
like I've always wanted.

147
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,669
No way, I won't stand for that.

148
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:15,341
If Mun-ho is available in the market,
my company has priority.

149
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,009
Let's stop the gibberish.

150
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,929
What do you say, Mun-ho?

151
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,308
Would you enter the political world
as our media representative?

152
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,397
We think you are perfect for the job.

153
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,899
You're a star, and you're handsome.

154
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,026
That is very important.

155
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,195
What is more important
is your defiant attitude.

156
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,739
You make such bold statements
with conviction.

157
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,658
That's why the younger generation
is rooting for you.

158
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,662
We're not so good with the young people.

159
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,873
Mun-ho, you can win them over for us.

160
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,501
I have a question.

161
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,963
When you say, "us,"

162
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,090
who do you exactly mean?

163
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,639
Mr. Seo.

164
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,396
What should we have Mun-ho to do first?

165
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,363
How about mayoral candidate,
Kim Ui-chan's campaign?

166
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,240
That's a good idea.

167
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,785
He will have his candidacy
announcement ceremony soon.

168
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,745
Start by showing your face there.

169
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,249
Right. You must show this face often.

170
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,127
That way, we can benefit
from having a start reporter with us.

171
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,837
Mun-ho.

172
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,465
Trust us.

173
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,802
We will be the platform to your success
in this world.

174
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,473
Let's aim for that high position.

175
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,976
Us, together.

176
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:57,401
Then, I'll appoint him as a spokesperson
for Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan's campaign.

177
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,819
Good.

178
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,405
Let's drink. Mun-ho.

179
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,504
Thank you for coming all the way to Seoul.

180
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,216
It's my case.
If there is any progress, I should come.

181
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,510
I could've e-mailed the file to you.

182
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,802
I wanted to hear it

183
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,846
from the person who has been chasing him
for five years.

184
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,891
So, is he really Healer?

185
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,309
Let's go.

186
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,897
The victim, Ko Seong-cheol,
landed at Incheon Airport,

187
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,567
took the shuttle,
and transferred to the subway.

188
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,029
But there was a problem
with the subway that day.

189
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,159
The train stopped for a few minutes

190
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,161
between Gayang Station
and Jung-ri Station.

191
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,163
From what we know,

192
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,959
someone hacked into the system
and stopped the train.

193
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,876
What?

194
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,254
You can hack the subway system?

195
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,757
The station's security cameras,
where this train came from,

196
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,094
were temporarily disabled.

197
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,930
And at the same time,
at the next station...

198
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,021
These guys...

199
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,190
They are Double S Guard's men.

200
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,775
Double?

201
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,443
What is that?

202
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,363
They are messengers like Healer.

203
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,701
They're probably the largest
messenger group in the nation.

204
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,078
So, are they working with the Healer?

205
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,580
No, I don't think so.

206
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,042
It looks like they fought
over Ko Seong-cheol.

207
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,170
It's so complicated.

208
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,631
How did you find that out?

209
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,133
Let's take a look.

210
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,305
I found this
while looking into social media sites.

211
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,558
This is a video taken by
a passenger on that train.

212
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,477
They must have filmed it when

213
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,771
the subway came to a sudden stop
in between stations.

214
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,571
This is the murder victim, Ko Seong-cheol.

215
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,532
I believe this is Healer next to him.

216
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,951
And...

217
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,501
They were being chased.

218
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,587
Those men are from Double S Guard.

219
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,673
E-mail me this video.

220
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,675
-Let me take a closer look.
-Yes, sir.

221
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,345
A hacker can even stop the subway.

222
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,347
That's impressive.

223
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,476
But is this police station safe?

224
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,271
No hacker has broken
through the police firewall.

225
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,650
Unless there's an insider, of course.

226
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,302
Gosh, Yoon Dong-won.

227
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,721
You annoyingly diligent punk.

228
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,100
When is he going to retire?

229
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,082
MS. JO

230
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,668
Yes, boss.

231
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,838
Healer turned off his tracker again.

232
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,381
You need to find him.

233
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,759
Don't do anything once you find him.

234
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,761
You just need to watch his back.

235
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,599
Yes, I know that punk hates it
when someone is behind him.

236
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,268
But the situation is very dangerous now.

237
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,562
I keep getting a headache.

238
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,149
First, find the girl, Chae Yeong-sin,

239
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,234
since he said he would be around her
for a while.

240
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,834
Chief, I have a question.

241
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,921
Don't ask questions while eating.
Just eat.

242
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,174
Why were you fired from your old
newspaper company a long time ago?

243
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,135
Guys, watch how much she drinks.

244
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,929
She's starting to lose it.

245
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,057
You were fired for writing an article
that your boss told you not to, right?

246
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,477
You got fired for fighting
for the truth, right?

247
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,439
Stop her.

248
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,067
-Hey!
-What a waste.

249
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,986
You made me spill it.

250
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,241
And that was not that long ago.

251
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,493
I'm not that old, for crying out loud.

252
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,161
If it wasn't a long time ago,

253
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:46,708
shouldn't there be something
alive and squirming inside you?

254
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,336
Did an alien lay an egg inside me
or something?

255
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,421
What do you mean alive and squirming?

256
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,884
I'm trying to be serious here.
Stop cutting me off.

257
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,802
That's what I'm saying.

258
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,180
Don't try to be serious when we're eating,
and just eat.

259
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,098
Here you go.

260
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,392
-What on earth.
-You eat.

261
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,060
Hey, stop her.

262
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,203
Our chief has turned
into a grumpy old man.

263
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,290
That's why you're afraid
of political articles.

264
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,251
You can only write about love affairs.

265
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,627
This is making me sad.

266
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,337
This is such a tragedy. I'm so sad.

267
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,716
I need someone young, someone fresh.

268
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,885
Where is Park Bong-su?
Where's my junior assistant?

269
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,971
He will be here soon.
He needed to stop by somewhere.

270
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,308
What? Why?

271
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,477
Without his direct superior's permission?

272
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,963
You look just like your dad.

273
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,097
After your dad passed away like that,

274
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,726
looking after you was hard for me.

275
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,615
You like braised potatoes.

276
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,408
Eat.

277
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,048
You should eat too, Mother.

278
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,842
I made your favorite grilled mackerel.

279
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,394
Mom, are you going somewhere?

280
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,064
Yes, I'm going somewhere.

281
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,483
Where are you going?

282
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,570
Somewhere kind of far away.

283
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,157
When are you coming back?

284
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,576
I probably...

285
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,871
won't be coming back.

286
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,623
Why not?

287
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,085
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:40,424
Then, can I visit you instead?

289
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,181
I'm sorry.

290
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,523
Eat. I'll leave after you finish.

291
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,353
Don't you dare sneak out
of your after-school class.

292
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,231
I'll be waiting for you when
you come out, okay?

293
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,692
-Answer me.
-I said okay.

294
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,410
Hello?

295
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,348
I don't know who invented shaved ice,

296
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,391
but I want to send that person
a letter of appreciation.

297
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,479
What grade is your son in, Mom?

298
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,065
He's a senior soon.

299
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,026
He just hates to study.

300
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,780
He won't even listen to me.
He's making me age quickly.

301
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,033
What about your husband?
Is he drinking less?

302
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,410
Him? Drink less?

303
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,453
My goodness.

304
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,623
He has too many reasons to drink.
He would rather eat less.

305
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,544
But what brings you here, Jeong-hu?

306
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,133
This photo.

307
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,762
You said they are dad's friends, right?

308
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,723
You still have this?

309
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,560
I only have a few photos of him.
This is one of them.

310
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,645
What about them?

311
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,067
Do you know them well?

312
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,361
Not really.

313
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,864
They are your dad's college buddies.

314
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,492
I think he worked at the same newspaper
as your dad.

315
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,369
I think his wife was a reporter too.

316
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,748
This woman is married to this man.

317
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,459
Do you know where they are now
or what they do?

318
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,337
No. This was so long ago.

319
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:29,050
Look how young your dad looks here.
I'm so old now.

320
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,303
I fell for this face.

321
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,181
Do you have any of dad's stuff?

322
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,975
I don't think so.

323
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,562
You know I can't have
things like that now.

324
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,191
Is that so?

325
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:46,902
I'll take a look.

326
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,030
-Jeong-hu.
-What?

327
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,074
Why did you order red beans
when you don't like them?

328
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,868
I like red beans.

329
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,787
Why do you always
push them over to me then?

330
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,206
Because you like them, Mom.

331
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,059
-Please!
-We have a lot of food left.

332
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,646
-But you have to go.
-No, just one more...

333
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,522
I'm sorry I'm late.

334
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,108
What, it's over already?

335
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,402
No, they are all inside. You should go in.

336
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,196
Oh, it's my junior assistant.

337
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,867
Your name is Park Bong-su! Bong-su!

338
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,494
Are you leaving?

339
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,120
Yeong-sin is a bit drunk.

340
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,583
How many times should I tell you?
I'm not drunk at all.

341
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,627
I have a really high tolerance.

342
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,255
My wish is to get drunk,
but it never happens.

343
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,131
-How annoying.
-You are drunk.

344
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,425
Right, did I tell you this?

345
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:57,514
The human brain consists of three layers.

346
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,558
She has been talking about dinosaurs
for a while.

347
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,018
That means she is really drunk.

348
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:07,023
Then I'll take her home.
You should go back in.

349
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,112
In the middle of the three layers,
way on the inside is...

350
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,114
There is still so much food left.

351
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,574
-Let's go.
-So...

352
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,827
-You want to hear my theory, right?
-Yes, sure.

353
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,788
-You want to hear it?
-Yes, the dinosaurs.

354
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,917
The chief said we don't know
what trouble she may cause,

355
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:30,297
so don't let her out of your sight
until she's in bed!

356
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,216
Okay? Good luck!

357
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,360
So, in the middle of the human brain...

358
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,987
Look, like this.

359
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,698
It's the size of a ping-pong ball.

360
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,576
That is the dinosaur's brain.

361
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,288
It's in your brain too, mister.

362
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,957
So, why is it there?

363
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,127
That's for our survival instinct.

364
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,839
This is the important part, so listen.
Focus!

365
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,716
Concentrate.

366
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,051
Taxi!

367
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,428
Just a minute.

368
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,306
Ma'am! Let's go!

369
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,016
You get angry and fight with them.

370
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,268
-You step on them.
-Hey!

371
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,896
You hit them and kill them!

372
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:33,693
-As long as you survive, isn't that right?
-Ma'am.

373
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,653
Ma'am, the taxi is here, so...

374
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,238
Let go of me.

375
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,866
-Let's go.
-Let go, you punk.

376
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,160
-Let's go. Come on.
-Wait. Hey.

377
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,330
I'm not done, you rotten dinosaur.

378
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,708
Let's talk about dinosaurs inside the cab.

379
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,188
Hey, Yeong-sin! Hey!

380
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,856
Hey!

381
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,526
Look at her. Her eyes lost focus.

382
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,404
Chi-su, Yeong-sin is wasted.

383
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,614
How much did you drink?

384
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,573
Dad.

385
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,371
I think about dinosaurs
every now and then.

386
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,375
Don't you feel bad for them?
They didn't have any choice, right?

387
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,752
You're completely wasted.

388
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,380
Who are you?

389
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:40,009
-Hello, I am--
-Oh, this dude?

390
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,636
He is my junior assistant.

391
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,556
His name is Bong-su.

392
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,849
Bong-suk.

393
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,893
Bong-suk.

394
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,108
-Ma'am...
-Hey, Bong-suk

395
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,025
Right!

396
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,112
Why do you want to go home

397
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,782
Hey. Wait. Would you get her?

398
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:07,996
-Let's go, Yeong-sin.
-Why? Why now...

399
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,878
Bong-suk, what will we do
About these drinks?

400
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,131
Wow, this lady is very strong.

401
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,926
Well...

402
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,681
Hello, I'm Park Bong-su.

403
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,018
I'm Yeong-sin's direct subordinate.

404
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,020
That is why I brought her home today.

405
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:36,316
I live way out in Incheon
and given the time,

406
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,359
the buses and trains have stopped running.

407
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,530
I listened to her talking about dinosaurs
for 40 minutes on the cab ride here.

408
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,201
And the cab fare was pretty hefty...

409
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,621
And I don't have much money...

410
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,001
So, may I sleep here for the night?

411
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,805
You're her direct subordinate?

412
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,015
Yes.

413
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,142
Does that mean you'll be stuck with her
on a daily basis?

414
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,981
That's how I'll learn from her, I guess?

415
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,488
What? Wait, we just met.

416
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,573
Where are we going?

417
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,325
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

418
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,285
Please don't kill me.

419
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,579
Wait! I'll never do that again.

420
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,165
Oh, the bed...

421
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,628
-Hey, Ms. Joo.
-Yes?

422
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,339
Did I tell you this?

423
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,676
When people are born,

424
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,720
they only have a dinosaur's brain
in their heads.

425
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,888
Did I tell you that?

426
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,975
Tell me about it tomorrow.
Let's sleep for now.

427
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:58,189
Then, another part of the brain develops,
which is a mammal's brain.

428
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,902
That part is completed during puberty.

429
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,406
It controls emotions.

430
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,785
The pain that you feel now

431
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:16,249
and this bad feeling I get
when I look at you...

432
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,335
You're drunk. You should go to sleep.

433
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,837
There is an important thing left.

434
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:26,175
The final part of the brain develops,
which is only seen in humans.

435
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,595
That is a primate's brain.

436
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,013
The frontal lobe.

437
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,640
This...

438
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,605
This is what makes people different
from dinosaurs and other animals.

439
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,984
By the time a woman hits 25,
it gets fully developed.

440
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:49,908
But I passed 25 a long time ago.

441
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,826
So...

442
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,958
What are you doing?

443
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,837
Do I look drunk to you?

444
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,007
You reek of alcohol.

445
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,637
Fine, let's say I'm drunk.

446
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,764
Let's cause some trouble.

447
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,643
Only humans cause trouble
when they're drunk.

448
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,404
Please don't tell Yeong-sin

449
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,282
what we are about to tell you.

450
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,701
Okay, I understand.

451
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,746
I won't let her know.

452
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,416
Since you're with Yeong-sin all the time,

453
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,752
I have a favor to ask you.

454
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:47,507
You call this asking for a favor?

455
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,424
No.

456
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,970
I have a few warnings for you.

457
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,683
-There are at least three.
-Three?

458
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,309
-First.
-Yes, sir?

459
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,019
Don't let her drink.

460
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,689
That is difficult.

461
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,483
She is super quick at grabbing a bottle.

462
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,567
Especially...

463
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,404
when she talks about dinosaurs,

464
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,072
that's a warning sign.

465
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,701
Well, she doesn't drink that often.

466
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,578
Maybe three or four times a year?

467
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,290
But every time she gets drunk,
she causes trouble.

468
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,583
Big trouble.

469
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,838
-Second.
-Okay, second.

470
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,798
Don't let her open cans.

471
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,884
Cans, sir?

472
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,679
She tends to cut her finger
when she opens cans.

473
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,265
One out of three times, she draws blood.

474
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,602
-And never...
-Yes, sir? Never what?

475
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,732
Never, under any circumstances,
let her see violence.

476
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,443
Violence?

477
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,070
Something happened to her

478
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,532
when she was young.

479
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,244
So, if she sees violence...

480
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,539
Well, she...

481
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,335
She'll start to seize.

482
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,130
I see.

483
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,425
She will have difficulties breathing.

484
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,219
What? Difficulties in breathing?

485
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,515
-It's post-traumatic stress--
-Quiet!

486
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,899
She gets chest pains
and other respiratory symptoms.

487
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,275
So...

488
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,946
she won't be able to breathe properly
if she sees violence

489
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,615
even if it's only a glimpse?

490
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,450
Don't try to find out anything more.

491
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,576
Anyway,

492
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:43,414
never let her go anywhere
near anything violent.

493
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,084
Please keep her away.

494
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,126
Yes, sir.

495
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,712
I'm asking you for a favor.

496
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,964
Of course, that's a favor.

497
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,636
-Yes, do us this favor.
-Yes, this is a favor too.

498
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,935
There are so many books.

499
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,317
When did you first report it?

500
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,654
That was the 17th of last month.

501
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:19,283
On the 17th of last month, Actress J...

502
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:25,248
reported businessman H to the police

503
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,333
for sexual assault.

504
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,922
I'm going to be graphic from here on.
Is that okay?

505
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,175
I told you,
I just want you to tell the truth.

506
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,771
SHE WAS DRUGGED...

507
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,736
SHE WAS FORCED TO PERFORM SEXUAL FAVORS

508
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,238
"It turns out,

509
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,951
among the clients that H forced her
to perform sexual favors for,

510
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,708
is a person who is

511
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,377
none other than...

512
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:17,175
Assemblyman K of the ruling party."

513
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,010
What about his name?

514
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,846
I gave you their names.
Why aren't you using them?

515
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,183
Then I have to reveal your name too.

516
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,644
Do it. I don't care about my name.

517
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,563
I don't want to.

518
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,649
Why not? Are you afraid?

519
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,319
Yes, I'm terrified.

520
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:40,406
Once your name is out there,
what will you do then?

521
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,783
Don't you care what happens to you next?

522
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,871
Do you want to go down with them?
That is not fair.

523
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,499
They alone should get punished
for what they did.

524
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,424
SEOUL MAYORAL CANDIDATE

525
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,844
"K" HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH
FORCING SEXUAL FAVORS...

526
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,272
Dinosaurs, mammals, and humans.

527
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,569
THE ARTICLE HAS BEEN SENT

528
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,490
Wait.

529
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,706
Darn it. Who is that woman?

530
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,926
Why are there so many women?

531
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,180
Hold on.

532
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,643
What the...

533
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,077
Boss?

534
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,871
Wait, the thing is...

535
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,457
Did you really think

536
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,045
that you could tail me?

537
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,133
No, that's not it. What happened was...

538
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,222
Here.

539
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:32,018
From now on,
I need you to tail him and not me.

540
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,021
JEONG-HU

541
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,522
NO TITLE

542
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,276
Who is he?

543
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,571
Don't you watch the news?
He's a big shot reporter.

544
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,700
Tail him 24 hours a day
and report to me his every move.

545
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,287
But the boss said that
she was nervous about you

546
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,205
and that you turned off your tracker.

547
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,374
I'm not tailing you, but...

548
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,960
I was only watching your back.

549
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,889
Hey, excuse me.

550
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,933
Hey, miss.

551
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,479
Seriously. Hey, you.

552
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,732
That's my spot.

553
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,985
Hey.

554
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,614
You said you can't sleep with someone
in the same room.

555
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,325
I am that someone.

556
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,368
Excuse me.

557
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,539
Hey.

558
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,416
Hey.

559
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,755
I'm right next to you.

560
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:52,510
So you should go back to your room and...

561
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,352
You shouldn't do this

562
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,943
to a stranger.

563
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,411
One, two, three.

564
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,163
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

565
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,749
Good.

566
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,835
Here.

567
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,882
So, are you really the first
to buy a house among us?

568
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,384
Are you jealous?

569
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,511
You're so proud of me, right?

570
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,223
Goodness, I'm dying from jealousy.

571
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,642
Congratulations.
You have a beautiful house.

572
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,603
Half of it was through loans.

573
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,062
We're in financial trouble now.

574
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,523
Where is Ji-an?

575
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,402
She was playing with Jeong-hu.
Where did she go?

576
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,445
I don't know.

577
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,753
What? I'm going to kill him!

578
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,130
Hey!

579
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:58,404
We must protect our source,
so we can't tell you.

580
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,824
We can't tell you who K is either.

581
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,787
No, Yeong-sin is not in.

582
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,997
Where is Yeong-sin?
I thought someone saw her.

583
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,458
Isn't she in? I thought someone saw her!

584
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,626
I didn't see her.

585
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,212
Take it down. Take down the article.

586
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,424
Let's take it down first.
This is very bad.

587
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,094
The view count is insane.
We are in first place.

588
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,388
Who cares about the view count right now?

589
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,848
It's a top search term too.

590
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,058
"Actress sexual exploitation.
Assemblyman K."

591
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,353
Where is Yeong-sin?

592
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,402
They're looking for you out there.

593
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,448
It's a madhouse right now.

594
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,580
Hey. Seriously?

595
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,627
What should we do?

596
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,715
This is what the article says.

597
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,885
"Assemblyman K of the ruling party,
favored to be next mayor of Seoul."

598
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,761
It's obviously Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan.

599
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,763
Is Mun-ho in?

600
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,932
Yes, he just went into the editing room.

601
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,352
-Listen carefully.
-Yes, I'm listening.

602
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,938
It will be a mess
if Mun-ho gets involved in this.

603
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,315
Yes, ma'am.

604
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,859
I'll assign something else to Mun-ho.

605
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,695
That's where you come in.

606
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,990
Your mission is to prevent him
from looking at anything else.

607
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:29,161
But chief, how could I dare stop him?

608
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,079
I don't think I can do it.

609
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,958
You said you're from the suburbs, right?

610
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,585
Yes, from Chuncheon.

611
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,340
If you can't do anything here,
do you want to transfer there?

612
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,133
No, ma'am. I'll on it.

613
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,766
That editing isn't urgent, is it?

614
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,142
Why?

615
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,938
We got a tip about Chairman Yang.

616
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,856
The Prosecutors' Office
is starting to take action.

617
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,150
They found evidence
that he hid his assets.

618
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,237
You know many prosecutors. Call them up.

619
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,238
Why?

620
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,034
The assets that he hid are art pieces.

621
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,995
You know we're doing
a special on artworks this week.

622
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,539
I want to include this with it.

623
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,709
You came all the way to this shabby room
just to tell me that?

624
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,838
You could have told me during the meeting
or called me to your office.

625
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,883
This isn't like you.

626
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,012
Take care of it for me.
I'll tell the cameraman.

627
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,473
Jong-su, why are you
tagging along with her?

628
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:32,766
Pardon?

629
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,685
You guys don't usually hang out together.

630
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,813
Well...

631
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,190
The thing is...

632
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,869
"K"" HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH
FORCING SEXUAL FAVORS...

633
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,079
Is this about Kim Ui-chan?

634
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,249
-Is it a respectable paper, not a tabloid?
-Ignore it.

635
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,293
How far did it spread?
Did others join the party?

636
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,627
It's Kim Ui-chan.

637
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:06,341
-It'll be forgotten in a day, so--
-This reporter is hiding the victim.

638
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,093
That's why he wrote it
with such confidence.

639
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,803
Where did this come from?

640
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:10,721
Kim Mun-ho.

641
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:12,973
-Which one is it?
-Pardon?

642
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,062
It's a small online newspaper.
The name is weird too.

643
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,398
I think it's called Sunday, or Someday,
or something like that.

644
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,941
I said ignore it.

645
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,943
Don't get involved.

646
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,696
The politics division
will take care of it, so...

647
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,410
So, you just take care
of the story about Chairman Yang.

648
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,622
Find out just how much artwork
he had and...

649
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,843
We've been asking for cooperation
from the media,

650
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,971
so it will be under control shortly.

651
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,725
But there are those we can't control.

652
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,813
What if it spreads to those people?

653
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,150
We can't let it spread to them.

654
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,319
It's unverified anyway.

655
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:12,449
It's obviously a ploy to attack
the next mayor of Seoul.

656
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,618
Yes.

657
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,537
You're right. It's just a ploy.

658
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:24,378
We can't allow people to slander others
based on groundless claims

659
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,046
and disturb the order of society.

660
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,507
We will take care of it.

661
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,926
I can't believe this.

662
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,928
What a disgrace.

663
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,889
Sexual favors? My goodness.

664
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,350
If my wife ever found out...

665
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,143
My gosh.

666
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,066
Regardless, people will bother you.

667
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,151
But rather than you,

668
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,989
I think Mr. Hwang is probably
an easier target.

669
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,325
Don't worry about me.

670
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,662
I will take all these secrets to my grave.

671
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,415
Mr. Hwang, watch your mouth.

672
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,668
-Pardon?
-What secrets?

673
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,673
Are you keeping any secrets?

674
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,926
No, of course not.

675
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,431
You said that troublesome actress
is missing, right?

676
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,765
Yes.

677
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,809
I'm sorry, sir.

678
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,729
Who is that reporter again?

679
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:29,192
Her name is Chae Yeong-sin
from Someday News.

680
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,945
Look into her.

681
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,489
She's probably hiding that woman.

682
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:39,703
Bring that woman and silence the reporter.

683
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,039
You figure out how.

684
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,500
I'll take care of it.

685
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,223
Hello.

686
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,437
It's him, right? Right?

687
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,980
Awesome.

688
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,026
Take a look at this.

689
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,361
What's the view count?

690
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,698
It's so loud.

691
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,327
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin
is not at her desk.

692
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,079
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin
is not at her desk right now.

693
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,707
Hang up. It's so noisy.

694
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,335
He said to hang up. Okay.

695
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,184
Gosh, what is wrong...

696
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,538
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

697
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,876
Yes, I'm Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.
That's right.

698
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,340
May we speak for a minute?

699
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,260
I'm your fan.

700
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,225
How could he?

701
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,896
Hand over that story to me.

702
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:15,817
You probably won't be able
to protect that story or your source.

703
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,820
It's too much of a waste
if it gets buried.

704
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,572
So leave it to me.

705
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,490
My goodness.

706
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,534
I didn't think he would be like that.

707
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,494
I'm a good judge of character,

708
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:32,542
but I never thought he would be
such a hypocrite and fake.

709
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,545
But why are you following me?

710
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,463
Sorry?

711
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:40,175
Well, I left something at your house.

712
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,889
Kim Mun-ho.

713
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,058
Is that how you became a star?

714
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:53,772
By stealing stories of unknown reporters
and making it your own?

715
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,732
Is that how you made it? My gosh.

716
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,361
When did you start speaking down to me?

717
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,278
Me?

718
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,198
I would never do that, ma'am.

719
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,580
What should I do about
this feeling of betrayal?

720
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,334
What should I do? Gosh.

721
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,212
That source is probably
in danger right now.

722
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,799
Can't you tell whether or not
she's in danger?

723
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,594
You don't understand
what is going on, do you?

724
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,431
You have no clue what you've done
or how things are going turn out,

725
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,558
do you?

726
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,853
How dare he talk down to me?

727
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,398
That arrogant piece of...

728
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,358
I can't believe I idolized
someone like that.

729
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,496
Ms. Jo.

730
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,125
Hey, you mutt! Where are you?

731
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:59,295
I turned on my tracker.
Hack into the security camera up there.

732
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,381
Why?

733
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,633
What's going on? What is it?

734
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,315
Healer, you need to run.

735
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,276
Those are Sang-su's guys.

736
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,778
They are the guys
whom you fought with last time.

737
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,947
Your face is exposed.

738
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,866
What are you doing? I said run!

739
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:14,788
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin?

740
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,796
Who are you?

741
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,380
That's none of your business.

742
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,549
You know Joo Yeon-hui, right?

743
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:33,890
Hey, you should answer
when someone asks a question.

744
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,310
-Who?
-Joo Yeon-hui.

745
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,062
You know her.

746
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:44,943
All right, you're going to take us to
Joo Yeon-hui now.

747
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,070
Do you understand?

748
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,992
-Hey, new guy.
-Yes, ma'am?

749
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:57,831
I'll distract them, so you run.

750
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,251
Call the police.

751
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,092
Excuse me.

752
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,845
You seem to be mistaken.

753
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,763
What? Joo what?

754
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:14,681
Joo Yeon-hui?

755
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:18,226
If you tell me who that is, maybe I can...

756
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,564
You're really annoying.

757
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,990
Hey, get rid of him.

758
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,160
What are you doing?

759
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,371
That hurts!

760
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,419
I'll go, so stop.

761
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,087
Stop it! I'll go!

762
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,755
-I'm sorry!
-Leave him alone.

763
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,632
I said I'm going! I'll go!

764
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,800
Come on.

765
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,127
Healer.

766
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,504
You didn't hit them back, right?

767
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,339
Good.

768
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,090
Now get out of there.

769
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,108
Something happened to her

770
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,611
when she was young.

771
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,697
She will have difficulties breathing.

772
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,033
It was too painful.

773
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:01,079
It was so painful
that I considered killing myself.

774
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,543
It hurt terribly where I was hit.

775
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,841
A couple of my ribs were broken.

776
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:24,269
I called the police.
They will be there in 10 minutes.

777
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,603
Get out of there.

778
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,918
Are you serious?

779
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,134
This is bad. This is really bad.

780
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,094
Healer showed up? Where?

781
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,179
Next to Chae Yeong-sin.

782
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,640
Just do as I instructed.

783
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,225
I can't resign.

784
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,852
This is so unfair.

785
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,813
Come to me if you can't handle it.

786
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,314
I sent you a picture.

787
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,191
Find out who they are.

788
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,028
From 1992 until now,
we've been on the same side.

789
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,114
Do you know how much I was worried?

790
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:26,200
Do you like Yeong-sin that much?

791
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,661
That's the guy. It's Healer.
