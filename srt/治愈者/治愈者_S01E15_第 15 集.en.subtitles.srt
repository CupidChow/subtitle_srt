1
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,556
Is anyone here?

2
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,770
Bong-su!

3
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,652
Bong-su.

4
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,048
Is that a little warmer?

5
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,037
You crash at my place
whenever you feel like it.

6
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,834
I'm just asking for one night.
This isn't fair.

7
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,043
I'm not leaving.

8
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,425
Are you not afraid of anything?

9
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,053
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,930
Don't you know who I am?

11
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,100
You have no idea how much

12
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,019
I'm hiding from you.

13
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,188
I don't care.

14
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,065
Are you stupid?

15
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,942
Don't send me away.

16
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,653
If you send me away,

17
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,823
you'll cry for the rest of your life.

18
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,204
I...

19
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,042
might hurt you.

20
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,627
No.

21
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,173
You'd never hurt me. Ever.

22
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,200
Don't send me away.

23
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,289
Please don't.

24
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,406
I thought it was a dream.

25
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,034
I rarely dream when I sleep,

26
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,121
so I kept wondering
why it was going on for so long.

27
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,347
I couldn't help but keep asking myself,

28
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,018
"Is this real or is it just a dream?"

29
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,274
Then another question crossed my mind.

30
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,153
"Is it okay if this is real?"

31
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,718
Seriously--

32
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,272
-Come on. It's cold.
-It's not cold at all.

33
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,943
I said I'd give you a ride.

34
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,574
Don't leave
until you finish everything I cooked.

35
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,243
You know I have a whole list
to confront you about.

36
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,245
Okay. I got it.

37
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,582
Bye.

38
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,881
My goodness.

39
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,702
I'll get off at the next stop.

40
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,248
-You're unbelievable.
-Please.

41
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,959
-You'll get off at the next stop, right?
-Yes.

42
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,461
Okay.

43
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,817
Bye.

44
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,610
Go home and eat.

45
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,003
But Ms. Jo,

46
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,923
I get confused
between what's real and what's fake.

47
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,343
My line of work requires me to be fake.

48
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,054
I hide my face and use a fake identity.

49
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,686
Whenever I meet someone,
I can never be myself.

50
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,688
But...

51
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,191
when I'm with her,
I have to be my true self.

52
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,778
But you know...

53
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,239
My true self?

54
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,326
Well, what is that?

55
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,369
Is there really such a thing?

56
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,832
Since when did you ponder
about deep things like that?

57
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,211
-I know, right?
-I'll say this for the 49th time.

58
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,588
Don't think.

59
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,634
-Whenever you think, you cause trouble.
-Ms. Jo.

60
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,177
Reset the watch.

61
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,012
Thanks.

62
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,682
It's about time to replace the battery,
so check it.

63
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:42,933
I'm going out.

64
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,560
Where are you going?

65
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,270
Well,

66
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,190
to find the real me.

67
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,486
He's losing it more and more.

68
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,988
It's not like I can reset him
or something.

69
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,575
I guess it really is time to replace him.

70
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,242
You know,

71
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,910
I was worried about you.

72
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,579
It seems like Yeong-sin
has been waiting for you too.

73
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,289
Did you call her?

74
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,916
She came to me.

75
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,252
Did you tell her

76
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,753
who you really are?

77
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,423
I never told her,

78
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,259
but she figured it out herself.

79
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,010
How much does she know?

80
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,304
I'm trying to decide how much to tell her.

81
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:04,849
But...

82
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,601
she doesn't ask me anything.

83
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,063
She doesn't ask me why I live this way,
or how I got hurt.

84
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,231
She doesn't even ask...

85
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,402
what my real name is.

86
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,158
You like Ji-an, don't you?

87
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,036
That's why you couldn't tell her

88
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,707
who she is, who her father was,

89
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,083
and the story about your dad.

90
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,085
I said I'm thinking.

91
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,962
Then you should cut me some slack too.

92
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,549
It's because I like Myeong-hui
and Ji-an too.

93
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,969
That's why I haven't been able
to tell them.

94
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,055
Let's end the formalities here

95
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,682
and get to business now.

96
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,767
Sure.

97
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,813
-I want to avenge Master's death.
-Okay.

98
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,902
And I want to clear my dad's name
so that the whole world,

99
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,614
not just the ones who are involved,
would know that he is innocent.

100
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,948
Of course.

101
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,367
-Anything else?
-I need to know

102
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,454
when I can tell Yeong-sin...

103
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,165
that her biological mother is alive.

104
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,791
Don't you think

105
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,835
that would be when the truth wouldn't hurt

106
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,504
both her and Myeong-hui?

107
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,630
When would that be?

108
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,381
Both matters are related.

109
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:25,137
You said you would get to the bottom of it
and find a way to get back at everyone

110
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,556
who is involved in this matter, right?

111
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,975
-I did.
-Did you find a way?

112
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,812
I have thought about it,
and there is only one way.

113
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,732
We should do just as your dad
and Yeong-sin's dad did in the past.

114
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,777
The way I have only pretended
to do all my life.

115
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,156
So, are you with me on this?

116
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,201
-Just like my dad did?
-Yes.

117
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,829
-What's the success rate?
-If you're with me, 50%.

118
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,344
What you asked earlier...

119
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,181
You're right. I like Yeong-sin.

120
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,894
I just wanted you to know that.

121
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,958
Kim Mun-sik began working for Boss in 1992
immediately after that incident.

122
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,295
After working under him for a few years,
he went out on his own,

123
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,964
and Boss sent Assistant Oh
to work for him.

124
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,341
Assistant Oh has several different names
and identities,

125
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,594
one of which is a lawyer.

126
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,143
They have an interesting relationship.

127
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,521
You can consider Mun-sik
and Assistant Oh as two sides of a coin.

128
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,608
He was a dear friend of mine.

129
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,153
I want to make everything
as perfect as possible.

130
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,742
From the funeral to the columbarium,
we'll prepare the best for him.

131
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,330
Assistant Oh does all the dirty work,

132
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,042
and Mun-sik remains an innocent gentleman.

133
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,003
Sometimes,

134
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,257
it seems like Mun-sik truly believes
that he hasn't done anything wrong.

135
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,885
It's as if he really doesn't remember
anything.

136
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,013
That's why I kept getting fooled too.

137
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,568
Is this the only picture we could find?

138
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,864
It wasn't easy for us

139
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,867
to get that picture from the police.

140
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,494
Master, I know you're not in there,
but it still feels weird.

141
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,329
It may be just your ashes...

142
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,835
but I don't want to hand you over...

143
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:45,838
to that guy.

144
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,472
I'm busy these days, so later on,
when I have a lot of time to kill,

145
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,766
I'll scatter your ashes somewhere nice.

146
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,811
Somewhere in the South Pacific.
How does that sound?

147
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,330
This is the script
for Kim Mun-sik's interview

148
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,083
that we will conduct
during this week's ABS Spotlight.

149
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,086
I risked my life to get this information.

150
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,506
We'll confront him
regarding seven of those topics.

151
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,593
This is similar to what we have prepared,

152
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,763
but I'm not sure if there's a certain line
we shouldn't cross.

153
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,599
Why are you worried about that?
We are not being censored, are we?

154
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,975
That's right.

155
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,646
I've been worried about censorship
all my life, so it has become my habit.

156
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,274
-Jong-su.
-Yes?

157
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,359
-Did you tip off your spy?
-I did.

158
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,528
You leaked that we'll handle
Kim Mun-sik's interview, right?

159
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,823
I said you're preparing something huge.

160
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,200
Did you scare them good?

161
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,242
Yes.

162
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,621
I think Kim Mun-sik
has a connection in the cyber team.

163
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,623
The team will probably get involved.

164
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,167
So we should be thoroughly prepared.

165
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,169
Of course you'll ask me
to get it done by tomorrow.

166
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,005
So I was going to say
that it is impossible,

167
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,925
-but you won't even listen to me anyway...
-Chae Yeong-sin.

168
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,009
Yes.

169
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,887
-You're meeting Detective Yoon Dong-won?
-Yes.

170
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,013
We're meeting at 2:00 p.m.

171
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,891
-I'll be quick and assist with this story.
-No. Stick to your story.

172
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,143
That will be the most important topic
to cover.

173
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,979
-Pardon?
-I hired a freelancer for that story.

174
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,899
He said he'll need some help today.
Will you help him?

175
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,318
What kind of help?

176
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,361
Ask him yourself.

177
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,822
And Park Bong-su
is taking a leave of absence.

178
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,949
A leave? For how long?

179
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,700
I heard he has to take care of
personal matters.

180
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,745
It's always better to keep meetings short,
so let's end it here.

181
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,498
Yeong-sin, follow me.
Let's discuss how to tackle the story.

182
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,415
Okay.

183
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,379
A leave of absence?
Is that leave with or without pay?

184
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,298
That is a very important matter.

185
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,701
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin?

186
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,912
I'm Seo Jeong-hu.

187
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm the freelancer
who needs your assistance.

188
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:13,253
I just need you to help me
sneak into the police station

189
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,922
that you are having a meeting at.

190
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,929
What is your name again?

191
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,222
Seo Jeong-hu.

192
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,307
I was born in December 1987.

193
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,726
Do you want to know anything else?

194
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,478
Seo Jeong-hu?

195
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,773
Should I call you Mr. Seo Jeong-hu?

196
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,609
Or...

197
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,904
should I just call you by your first name?

198
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:42,908
I'm sorry...

199
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,245
for the late introduction.

200
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,124
We've finally met.

201
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,794
Yes, finally.

202
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:55,963
Nice to meet you.

203
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,174
-But...
-Yes?

204
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,342
you deserve a beating.

205
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,804
You are hitting me too hard.

206
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,768
Let's go.

207
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,482
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

208
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,782
Is it okay for you to be here?
It's a police station.

209
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,159
Don't you need to disguise yourself?

210
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,120
Shouldn't you wear a hat
or cover your face?

211
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,663
I do it when it's necessary.

212
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,040
I use whatever I can at the scene.

213
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,667
That's how I work.

214
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:39,131
And this is my boss' latest product.

215
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,635
Put this on here and...

216
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,222
Okay, now say something.

217
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,516
Say something? Like what?

218
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,684
Again.

219
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,147
So, is Park Bong-su never coming back?

220
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,190
Is the volume too low?

221
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,778
I miss Park Bong-su!

222
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,531
This is a very sensitive device.

223
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,242
You don't need to talk into it.

224
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,203
No, just forget that you are wearing it.

225
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,082
If you're conscious of it,
it will look more suspicious.

226
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,545
I'll figure out what the situation is
when we're there, okay?

227
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,549
Bong-su.

228
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,511
Bong-su...

229
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,556
What the...

230
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,780
Don't mess it up.

231
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,619
Just a moment, please.

232
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,622
This is the front desk.

233
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,750
Yes, I understand.

234
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,379
May I see your ID, please?

235
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,133
IDENTIFICATION CARD

236
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,597
Go up to the third floor
and ask for the cyber team.

237
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,598
Thank you.

238
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,725
Next, please?

239
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,192
Don't think about anything else.

240
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,028
Anything else? Like what?

241
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,614
Just do what you must do as a reporter.

242
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,324
I'll try.

243
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,415
If a dangerous situation arises...

244
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,667
-Hey.
-Yes?

245
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,794
I'm at the National Police Agency.

246
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,754
There are police everywhere.

247
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,381
What danger could I be in here?

248
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,387
Do it right. You have to.

249
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,772
Are you done?

250
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,692
Okay, shall we get to work?

251
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,237
-Where to?
-Go to the fourth floor and make a left.

252
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,822
The server room is at the end of the hall.

253
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,657
I'm sorry for making you come
all the way here.

254
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,075
-Please.
-Thanks.

255
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,453
We're in a state of emergency,
so I can't leave the office.

256
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,290
I'm the one who's sorry. You're so busy.

257
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,209
So, this is the cyber team's office?

258
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,795
Why? Does it look too ordinary?

259
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,298
-No.
-Would you like something to drink?

260
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,092
No, you're busy, so I'll keep it quick.

261
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,553
Sure. What were we going to...

262
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,470
Right.

263
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:33,972
Information exchange.

264
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,518
You are going to tell me
about Hwang Je-guk's death.

265
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,770
And you will give me
information on Healer.

266
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,688
Right.

267
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,482
We'll reset it at 3:15 p.m.
Please be ready.

268
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,735
Get ready. Excuse me.

269
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,452
What is it? Is something wrong?

270
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,121
We're in the middle
of segregating the server.

271
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,664
I'm sorry.

272
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,460
What was that? Segregating the server?

273
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,629
Yoon Dong-won!

274
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,591
That stubborn and inflexible idiot!

275
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:14,304
He must have freaked out
after finding the backdoor I installed.

276
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,265
That means they will not allow anyone
accessing the system

277
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,935
if they are outside of the station.

278
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,102
That's absurd!

279
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,855
Criminals are out there causing mayhem,

280
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:28,485
and cops have to crawl back to the station
just to find a record?

281
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,279
What a load of nonsense!

282
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,114
Look, Ms. Jo.

283
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,741
Calm down.

284
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,118
Don't forget
that we are not on the police's side.

285
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,454
So, now what?

286
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,998
Is it useless for us
to plant the new backdoor?

287
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,921
Access any computer there for now.

288
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,675
Let's make one of the computers ours
before they reset it.

289
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,225
Now, where were we?

290
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,143
Oh, we were talking about...

291
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,813
-Hwang Je-guk and Healer.
-Right.

292
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,150
Didn't you say you didn't know much
about Healer last time?

293
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,446
You believed that? Come on.

294
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,563
PORTAL SYSTEM

295
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,321
It's done.

296
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,577
What is this?

297
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,120
THIS WEB PAGE CANNOT BE LOADED

298
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:06,041
They cut off all the access
from outside their network.

299
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,294
They won't let anyone in
before they reset.

300
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,464
So, if this doesn't work,
what's the next plan?

301
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,426
But there must be at least one
that is connected to the outside.

302
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:21,389
If there is one,
it must be Yoon Dong-won's computer.

303
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,849
I can't go there.

304
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,976
Yoon Dong-won and Yeong-sin are there.

305
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,895
We have four minutes until the reset.

306
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,523
If we can't get in before then, it's over.
This plan will fail.

307
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,527
So, what you do you know about Healer?

308
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,324
Actually...

309
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,162
I have met Healer.

310
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,415
When?

311
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,168
About three times...

312
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,004
over the past two months.

313
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,799
How did you meet him?

314
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,218
Can you tell us what he looked like?

315
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,096
Well...

316
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,726
-That man!
-Who?

317
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,645
The guy who just walked by the door!

318
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,771
Someone walked by?

319
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,190
There! That guy!

320
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,151
Wait, Reporter Chae! You, come with us!

321
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,864
Wait, Reporter Chae. Where are you going?

322
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,535
There! He's going downstairs. That's him.

323
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,869
I don't see anyone.

324
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,205
My hat. Hat...

325
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,957
Your hat?

326
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,564
3:14 P.M.

327
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,531
Okay! I'm in.

328
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,491
This is mine now.

329
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,010
-Reporter Chae.
-That's strange. Where did he go?

330
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,762
Hey, look at me.

331
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,931
-Yes?
-What is going on?

332
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,769
I thought it was him.

333
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,061
Him?

334
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,775
This guy I had a crush on.
I thought it was him.

335
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,901
A crush...

336
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,987
Where did he go? He was just here.

337
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,947
He was just...

338
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,250
Miss, do you know what you just did?

339
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,502
I'm screwed, right?

340
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,296
Obstruction of justice, assisting
in leaking confidential information--

341
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,089
How did I end up
with a boyfriend like this?

342
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,883
-Look here.
-This is just...

343
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,302
so much fun.

344
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,272
What? Did she just call me...

345
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,777
Am I her boyfriend? Gosh.

346
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,280
What a nice day.

347
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,450
I received Seo Jeong-hu's
arrival and departure record.

348
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,747
It says that he arrived
from Moscow on the 6th.

349
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,041
But...

350
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,168
But?

351
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,004
Take a look at this.

352
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,799
Our spy in the police department
sent this.

353
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,221
He started working at Someday News
before then.

354
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,306
Before returning from Russia.

355
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,606
He's even capable of fabricating
arrival and departure history.

356
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,317
Then we can safely assume
that this man in the picture is the one.

357
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,610
He's Healer.

358
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,701
Healer.

359
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,873
Seo Jeong-hu entered Someday News
as Park Bong-su.

360
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,501
And Mun-ho acquired Someday News.

361
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,879
Ji-an was there as well.

362
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,048
What's was the name she uses now?

363
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,800
Chae...

364
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,636
Yeong-sin?

365
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,765
Here is Ms. Choi's call record

366
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,934
acquired by Double S guard.

367
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,273
Hello, I'm Reporter Chae Yeong-sin
of Someday News.

368
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,192
May I speak with Ms. Choi Myeong-hui?

369
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,528
This is she.

370
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,040
Where is Seo Jeong-hu now?

371
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,417
He's taking time off from Someday News.

372
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,044
We're looking for him.

373
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,504
-And Ji-an?
-She's following her daily routine.

374
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:07,008
At Someday News during the day,
and Chae Chi-su's house at night.

375
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,679
You said Jeong-hu...

376
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,766
grew up alone without parents, right?

377
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,020
And Ji-an grew up in a house
filled with ex-cons.

378
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,313
Yes, sir.

379
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,611
Then they probably never learned
how to adapt to the society properly.

380
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,448
Do you plan to teach them a lesson?

381
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,283
I should.

382
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,412
That's the right thing to do.

383
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,648
Sergeant Park Ki-jung.

384
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,109
He's been working
under Yoon Dong-won for two years.

385
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,403
I'll send his address
to your navigation system.

386
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,030
Yeong-sin is still in the police station.

387
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,368
She thinks the police station
is the safest place in Korea.

388
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,870
-Healer?
-You know what I mean.

389
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,164
Master was killed in there.

390
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,249
Hey, kid.

391
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,670
Forget it. I need to go back and get her.

392
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,131
When will you get your head on straight?

393
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:33,511
Everything is going as planned,
so please don't ruin it!

394
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,054
Darn it!

395
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,474
I should just go somewhere
in the South Pacific and disappear.

396
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,819
So, you met him three times,
but never saw his face?

397
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:55,116
The first time, he stole my bag,
so I chased him.

398
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,785
-You chased Healer?
-Exactly.

399
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,288
But I was caught right away.

400
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,291
He was holding me from behind like this.

401
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,586
What could a frail girl do?
I just shook in fear.

402
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:12,133
I was so scared
that I had a nightmare that night.

403
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:19,348
Good job. Stall a little bit longer.

404
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,142
I'm almost done.

405
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,937
The second time,
I had my eyes covered like this.

406
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,815
That's when I received the video file.

407
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,400
You know, Hwang Je-guk's video.

408
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,526
Like this.

409
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,195
-I see.
-When I met him for the second time...

410
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,370
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

ODONG APARTMENT BUILDING 101, UNIT 304

413
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,892
Damn it!

414
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,883
Excuse me.

415
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,248
There is a family portrait.

416
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,000
What is his family status?

417
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,211
He has a wife, a daughter, and a son.

418
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,088
They are in Canada right now.

419
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,673
He lives apart from his family.

420
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,811
You go through his computer.

421
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,732
For someone working in the cyber team,
he's a bit too old-fashioned.

422
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,361
IDENTIFICATION CARD
NAME: NAM DAL-JUNG

423
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,617
He seems to have several accounts
under a fake name.

424
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,412
And...

425
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,917
here is the account number.

426
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,421
What is this?

427
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,011
There is a vial for some drug.

428
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,931
It doesn't look like some type
of cold medicine.

429
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,760
BANK STATEMENT
WIRE RECIPIENT: SEON HA-RA

REPORTER KIM MUN-HO

431
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,232
Yoon Dong-won speaking.

432
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,817
This is Kim Mun-ho.

433
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,279
I believe our reporter
is with you right now.

434
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,448
Yes, Reporter Chae Yeong-sin is here.

435
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:50,244
We're having such a pleasant talk,
time just flew by.

436
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,957
I'm sure I know more
about Healer than she does.

437
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,710
Actually, I was considering
whether to summon you as a witness

438
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,212
or go visit you in person.

439
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,091
At the morgue,
you told me that you were very close

440
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,136
to the man
who claimed himself to be Healer.

441
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,806
So I want to catch the one who killed him.

442
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,062
I'm investigating
with the help of informants.

443
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,480
Do you need that information?

444
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,857
Those informants...

445
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,234
Are they legitimate?

446
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:28,240
Well, I was taught we must protect
the identity of informants at all cost.

447
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:37,958
What just sent you is the accounts
your colleague, Sergeant Park Ki-jung,

448
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,461
have under a fake name.

449
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,421
Interesting, isn't it?

450
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,178
-Did you find Park Ki-jung?
-Someone saw him left an hour ago.

451
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:53,265
He sends his family in Canada
over 5,000 dollars monthly.

452
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,018
That's almost impossible
on a policeman's salary, isn't it?

453
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,437
-We have to go now. Hurry up. Hurry!
-What?

454
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,815
I'll give you everything we have received.

455
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,609
-But on one condition.
-Darn it.

456
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,447
Let us cover the full story
of the suspect's arrest. That's all.

457
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,953
I know that will be difficult.

458
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,623
Someone was murdered
at the National Police Agency,

459
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,169
and the suspect is a detective
working at the station.

460
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,422
Of course you don't want that to get out.

461
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,674
If you let us broadcast the story,

462
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,176
you may face greater consequences
than writing an apology letter.

463
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,638
So, will you hide the truth,
Detective Yoon Dong-won?

464
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,765
Did you call him?

465
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,976
His phone is off. We can't track him.

466
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,439
REPORTER KIM MUN-HO

467
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,904
Where does Park Ki-jung live?

468
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,990
In the Odong Apartments in Jangwi-dong.

469
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,457
-This wasn't supposed to happen.
-Pardon?

470
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,125
This is not why...

471
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,170
I put my job before family.

472
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,436
We're at the Seoul National Police Agency.

473
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,232
An investigation team
found a new lead for a case.

474
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,986
We at Someday News will be
accompanying them.

475
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,048
Darn it.

476
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,551
Shit.

477
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,072
Hello?

478
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,909
Speak slowly.

479
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,332
Wait, Detective Park.

480
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,253
Which phone are you calling from?

481
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,677
Hello? Assistant Oh...

482
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,679
Damn it!

483
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,395
Shit!

484
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,449
Wait!

485
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,869
I really couldn't understand
those who waste their time

486
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,122
on packing when they should just run.

487
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,125
But almost everyone does.
Isn't that interesting?

488
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,730
Reporters, please wait here.

489
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,273
-You stand guard.
-Yes, sir.

490
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,986
Where is this place
the investigation team has arrived at?

491
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,821
Probably where the suspect is, correct?

492
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,281
Yes.

493
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,784
May I ask what suspicion led you here?

494
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,584
What could this be?

495
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,777
There's another arrow here.

496
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,414
Sir! Over here.

497
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,871
Miss, do you have some time?

498
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,837
Stop teaching him lines like this, please?

499
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,672
It's really corny.

500
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,637
I think we're good. We should go too.

501
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:26,807
What?

502
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,396
They left me behind again.

503
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:44,283
There was a young college student
back in 1980.

504
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,454
He ran a pirate radio broadcast
with his friends.

505
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,916
The topic that we must talk about
and you must hear

506
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,545
is President Chun Doo-hwan's
curtailment of the press.

507
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,883
About 1,000 reporters were kicked out
in the last two months.

508
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,720
That pirate broadcast
ran for about a year.

509
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,603
That radio broadcast reported the facts

510
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,938
that no newspaper, radio,
or TV show covered.

511
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,774
The listeners who were able to tune in

512
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,987
secretly recorded those broadcasts
and shared them with others.

513
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,491
The pirate broadcasts
ended with Ki Yeong-jae's arrest.

514
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:30,078
He spent the next 11 years in prison

515
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,875
for revealing the truths
that the government tried to hide.

516
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,919
CCTV FOOTAGE ON THE DAY OF ABDUCTION

517
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:41,882
The police met him years later
when they received a report of abduction.

518
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,636
Yes. At first, we questioned him
as a witness,

519
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,388
but then things got complicated.

520
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:53,477
He was trying to tell us
about the illegal jobs

521
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,855
he did for some influential clients...

522
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,316
We're at the Seoul National Police Agency.

523
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,653
On the 13th, a questionable death occurred

524
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,613
in an interrogation room
at the police station.

525
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,699
It was a sad and unfortunate end of a man
that not one single newspaper

526
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,284
printed one single line about.

527

00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,539
Ki Yeong-jae was murdered
while he was being questioned.

529
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,208
The suspect that the police arrested is

530
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:20,712
Detective Park, who worked
at that very police station.

531
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,172
EVIDENCE

532
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,675
The items recovered at his apartment

533
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:28,303
include the poison
used to kill Ki Yeong-jae.

534
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,015
The police also uncovered

535
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,102
that for the past two years,
Detective Park had been receiving

536
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,729
ten million to twenty million won monthly

537
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,107
in the accounts he opened
under a fake name.

538
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,819
Who kept giving a policeman
that much money and why?

539
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,323
Park made a phone call
just before being arrested.

540
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,658
This is the recording of that call.

541
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,078
-Hello?
-Hello?

542
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,081
Assistant Oh, this is Park.
We have a problem.

543
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,041
Someone broke into my place.

544
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,793
He took my hard drive and everything.

545
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,753
I think he's on to me.

546
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,131
You need to help me.

547
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,841
Speak slowly.

548
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,969
I need to get away quickly.
So help me, please!

549
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:14,266
Wait. Detective Park,
which phone are you calling from?

550
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,602
PHONE CALL
BETWEEN THE SUSPECT AND ASSISTANT OH

551
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,732
This is a picture of Detective Park
meeting with that Assistant Oh.

552
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,653
Coincidentally,
I know this Assistant Oh personally.

553
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,324
He has worked as an assistant
of the Seoul mayoral candidate,

554
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:34,161
Kim Mun-sik, for over 20 years.

555
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,787
CCTV FOOTAGE ON THE DAY OF ABDUCTION

556
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,831
The mayoral candidate Kim Mun-sik
and Assistant Oh.

557
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,752
We obtained a footage of them
entering the building

558
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,714
at the same time on the day
Ki Yeong-jae was abducted.

559
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:50,093
The police obtained
these pieces of evidence--

560
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,934
We'll follow the investigation
and report it until the end.

561
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,276
-Were you watching?
-Yeong-jae...

562
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,403
is dead.

563
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,906
Did you know?

564
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,284
Are you okay?

565
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,831
I couldn't tell you. I was afraid
that you would be shocked, so--

566
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,592
I'd like to be alone.

567
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,928
-Myeong-hui--
-Please.

568
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:07,337
There are too many people
who die a wrongful death,

569
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,883
but not a single line about their deaths
are reported in the news.

570
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,846
We can't listen to all of their stories.

571
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,976
But we wanted to hear
at least one of their stories.

572
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:28,775
We...

573
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,362
remember you.

574
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:38,910
We did this broadcast to tell you that.

575
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,208
Thank you for joining us.

576
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,394
You called him...

577
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,063
Master, right?

578
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,775
Yes.

579
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,654
And he was your late father's friend?

580
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:16,990
Yes.

581
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,035
Was he a good person?

582
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:23,830
No.

583
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,459
He was a perverted old man.

584
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,922
But you still loved him.

585
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,301
Yes.

586
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,556
You have many good people around you.

587
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,477
-I do?
-Yes.

588
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,397
Including that lady I met last time...

589
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,735
your master, and me.

590
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,446
I'm the best of them all.

591
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,517
Master! You'll be right back, won't you?

592
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,936
You're pulling my leg, right?

593
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,441
Master, wait! Master!

594
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,965
KIM MUN-SIK

595
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,114
Well,
if it isn't the mayoral candidate Kim!

596
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,451
I enjoyed your broadcast.

597
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:07,994
Thank you.

598
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,246
We haven't shown you anything yet.

599
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,916
We are just getting started.

600
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,585
"We"?

601
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:19,547
I guess you are not familiar
with that concept, are you?

602
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,552
You're still very childish.

603
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,681
In the world I live in,

604
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,183
we only care about our survival.

605
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,603
So, we stick together
even if we are betrayed

606
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,897
or humiliated.

607
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,816
Our bond is unbreakable.

608
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,028
But what holds you guys together?

609
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,406
I know.

610
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,616
A cause, right?

611
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,910
I just got a call.

612
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:58,628
Your loyal Assistant Oh
is at the police station.

613
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,840
Once he opens his mouth,
I'm sure there will be no end.

614
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,883
Will you be okay?

615
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,135
I'll be okay...

616
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,054
because I will get him out.

617
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,684
Will you be okay?

618
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:17,272
I'm not sleeping much,
but I'm still healthy.

619
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,025
Do those kids trust you?

620
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,280
You think you could keep those kids
next to you

621
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,450
with that groundless cause of yours?

622
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,870
You think you'll continue being a "we"?

623
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,372
I know you have become
hopelessly pathetic,

624
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,875
but you shouldn't have brought them up.

625
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,419
Aren't you the one
who got them involved in this first?

626
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,338
It looks like they have grown up well.

627
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:46,009
Why did you stir them up?

628
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,596
I hear you're still having nightmares.

629
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,599
You could have gone through it yourself.

630
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,477
Did you have to make them suffer too?

631
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,978
Mr. Kim Mun-sik.

632
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,189
You guys always do that.

633
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,776
Create sides and make enemies.

634
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,863
Should I consider this
your declaration of war?

635
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,865
What?

636
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:14,621
I thought you had declared war against me.

637
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,583
Was I mistaken?

638
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,421
Didn't you?

639
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,759
Chae Yeong-sin speaking.

640
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,429
Your call is being forwarded to voicemail.

641
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,767
I'm Choi Myeong-hui. Do you remember me?

642
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,436
Yes, of course. Hello.

643
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,604
Are you free? I would like to meet you.

644
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,607
Of course. I'm completely free.

645
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,484
When should I come see you?

646
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:29,946
At your home?

647
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,073
No. I can get there myself.

648
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:38,496
Actually, I didn't expect
that you would contact me.

649
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,457
Thank you.

650
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,791
I'll see you later.

651
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,386
Ms. Chae Yeong-sin?

652
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,223
Yes, that's me.

653
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,766
This way, please.

654
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,444
Do you remember me?

655
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,821
Yes. Hello.

656
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,366
-My wife called, right?
-Yes, just now.

657
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,535
Let's go. I'll give you a lift.

658
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,205
That's not necessary.

659
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,499
Get in.

660
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,004
Okay, then. Thank you.

661
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,096
You don't drive?

662
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,809
No. I don't fear anything at all,

663
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,687
but strangely, I'm afraid of driving.

664
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,776
I think I was traumatized
as a child or something.

665
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:56,115
Sometimes, I have dreams
about cars racing down a dark road.

666
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,244
Shall we go now?

667
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:04,332
Yes, but drive slowly.

668
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,668
We shouldn't scare Reporter Chae.

669
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,086
Right.

670
00:59:56,092 --> 01:00:00,054
Remember Seo Jun-seok
you met at Sokcho Police Station in 1992?

671
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,516
I think my brother is working with Healer.

672
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,518
He knows you're Healer.

673
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,937
He says you're bad and dangerous.

674
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,940
Why would you do anything for them?

675
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,692
I'm their fathers' friend.

676
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,945
Did my father say he killed a person?

677
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,407
Yeong-sin,
your biological mother is alive.

678
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,243
You know Jeong-hu, right?
I think he's in danger.

679
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,329
I'll give you the money,
so just give me the tape.

680
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,164
That's the only way you'll live!
