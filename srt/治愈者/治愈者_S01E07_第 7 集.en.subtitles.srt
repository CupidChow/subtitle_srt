1
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,102
Hey, mutt. Are you up?

2
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:05,190
Do you like my upgraded wake up call?
It's the chicken version.

3
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,568
I faxed you your plane ticket.

4
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,863
It takes off this afternoon,
so get up and pack,

5
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,198
and don't forget your passport.

6
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,658
Get to the airport two hours early.

7
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,578
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,330
What plane ticket?

9
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,332
Your master chose the destination.

10
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,542
It's somewhere in Australia.

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,587
What? You spoke with him?

12
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:28,963
When?

13
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,757
So, where is he now?

14
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,470
You can swim
and hunt crocodiles for a year.

15
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,639
He said you should learn English
in your spare time too.

16
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,935
That old fart.

17
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,524
I need to see him.

18
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,401
Give me his number.
You have it, don't you?

19
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:54,405
Healer will be closing up shop
until you return.

20
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,950
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,245
I even found out about Kim Mun-sik.

22
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,457
-I just have to meet that jerk--
-Your master said he will meet that jerk.

23
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,754
Why?

24
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,172
You little runt.

25
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,508
Listen to your elders, will you?

26
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,637
Elders my butt.

27
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,556
What is it?

28
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,809
What are the two of you scheming?

29
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:23,935
Hey.

30
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,104
-What is it?
-Hey, Jeong-hu.

31
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,816
Jeong-hu?

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,025
Healer.

33
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,861
Pack up for now.

34
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,613
-As you pack, you can think--
-Forget it.

35
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,075
Will you go to the airport?

36
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,618
I'm going to work.

37
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,036
You promised!

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,582
You said you would only play bait
next to her for three days!

39
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,292
And three days passed long ago!

40
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,337
"Jeong-hu"?

41
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,342
Since when did you say my name
so lovingly like that?

42
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,804
And has Master called even once

43
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,098
after abandoning me
and taking off like that?

44
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,141
And now?

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,143
He bought me a plane ticket? Why?

46
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,897
So I can't work at the newspaper company?

47
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,690
That makes me want to go more.

48
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,026
To stop me from meeting Kim Mun-sik?

49
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,695
Then I must meet him today.

50
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,157
-Hey, you stray cat. So--
-So...

51
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,537
If that old fart has something to say,
he can talk to me in person.

52
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,467
I wasn't planning to come.

53
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:43,056
My animalistic instinct told me
that there is a trap up ahead.

54
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,391
That I would end up
with at least a broken ankle

55
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,309
if I get caught.

56
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,437
So, let's not get close and escape.

57
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,899
He's a night messenger.

58
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,109
You've never heard of him before, right?

59
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:01,699
All I know about him are the rumors,
but you know how rumors are.

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,910
They are exaggerated
and blown out of proportion.

61
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,578
But it made...

62
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,623
my heart race.

63
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,751
And it made me wonder.

64
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,757
That's how my second crush began.

65
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,261
It's true.

66
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,554
I wasn't going to bother saying goodbye.

67
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,893
Why bother saying goodbye
to someone I would never see again?

68
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,062
That's just silly.

69
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,362
So...

70
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,658
the reason I am here again
is purely because of Master.

71
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm here because of that wicked old man.

72
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,413
What? Go hunt crocodiles?

73
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,123
What the...

74
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,470
You scared me.

75
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,723
I told you, didn't I?

76
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,518
He would never follow an order
that he isn't convinced of.

77
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,978
What will you do now?

78
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,856
That little kid has grown up.

79
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,441
He grew a lot.

80
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,861
Honestly, he's better than you.

81
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,945
No way.

82
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,740
It isn't easy to surpass your teacher.

83
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,991
So, what will you do?

84
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,536
Her face is a Class A.

85
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,330
She's not bad.

86
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,000
She's really skinny in my opinion,

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,587
but that's the South Pacific's
standard of beauty.

88
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,717
She looks good from behind too.

89
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,555
Those bright eyes.

90
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,601
She must have an I.Q. of over 120.

91
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,853
What on earth are you doing?

92
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,271
Based on my experience,

93
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,817
a lady like that will never be satisfied
with a little kid like him.

94
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,362
So today, I'll accept your opinion.

95
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:13,164
I'm sure she will be drawn
to a man who is older and who has

96
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,250
a deeper insight into life.

97
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,544
In that respect,

98
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,131
we need to put Jeong-hu on the flight.

99
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,675
And then,

100
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,140
I'll fill that empty spot naturally
and more effectively.

101
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,979
Why are you reacting so violently?

102
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,398
Chae Yeong-sin.

103
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,691
Yes?

104
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,902
Shouldn't you be very busy right now?

105
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,654
Me?

106
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,240
What time is it?

107
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,910
It's 8:00 A.M...

108
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,161
That hurt.

109
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,621
Call home.

110
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,790
Tell them you won't be home
for a few days.

111
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,213
What game is this punk playing now?

112
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,424
He purchased an Internet newspaper

113
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,219
and the building
in which the newspaper is located.

114
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,180
He sold all of his shares

115
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,183
and the land in Yongin last week.

116
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:19,772
Those shares and real estate
were only under Kim Mun-ho by name.

117
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,233
Is that okay?

118
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:26,154
He called me saying that
it'd be more useful to him than me,

119
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,447
and that he would use it.

120
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,032
But selling those shares

121
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,953
without consulting the boss...

122
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:34,954
Mr. Oh.

123
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,122
Yes, sir.

124
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,248
It has been...

125
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,878
about 20 years since
the boss sent you to me, hasn't it?

126
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,088
It has been 22 years, sir.

127
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,090
Does he still come first?

128
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,010
I'm hurt.

129
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,857
Am I late?

130
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,027
No, I came early.

131
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,778
Have a seat, Miss Kang.

132
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,157
It's been a while
since we've eaten together like this.

133
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,326
You want to talk about Mun-ho, don't you?

134
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,994
Does that make you uncomfortable?

135
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,539
Then buy me drinks instead of lunch.

136
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,957
I need a drink.

137
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,352
That's strange.

138
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,729
Are you okay?

139
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,441
I'm fine now, but it's strange.

140
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,333
I almost passed out in the office.

141
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,211
Thanks.

142
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,921
I'm okay now.

143
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:55,219
You said that you can't breathe
only when you're scared.

144
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,972
So, why were you...

145
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,057
I don't know.
Maybe it was building up till now.

146
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,353
Maybe I should receive
an exorcism or something.

147
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,106
These past few days have been crazy.

148
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,400
You know, those gangster punks

149
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,321
waited for me in an alley
in the middle of the night.

150
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,324
Then that Hwang Je-guk,
that piece of trash.

151
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,577
I dreamed of him last night, so...

152
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:27,335
And when you came to work,
your crush was waiting for you.

153
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:32,798
No wonder you couldn't breathe.

154
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,303
Bong-suk, don't be like that.

155
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,805
I got a bit emotional last night,

156
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,226
and I did talk about some random things.

157
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,189
You better not use that against me
or anything.

158
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,569
About Reporter Kim Mun-ho...

159
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:59,283
Don't you really know him personally?

160
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,414
I seriously think he's here
because of you.

161
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,582
No way.

162
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,170
Why would he come for me?

163
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,511
Do you think so?

164
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,014
He is your crush after all.

165
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,060
Can't you feel a vibe at least?

166
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,733
You've never had a crush, have you?

167
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,155
Why do you get crushes at all?

168
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,782
You have a crush...

169
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,993
when there are no feelings being exchanged

170
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,745
and when there's no choice.

171
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,667
I turned on the news one day,
and he appeared on the screen.

172
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,420
What is this?

173
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,923
My heart began to race like crazy.

174
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,679
That face and that smile
kept popping into my head.

175
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,598
What is this?

176
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,268
But that's it.

177
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,602
Nothing is exchanged.

178
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,728
That's why it's a crush.

179
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,608
Then one day,
you hear something from someone.

180
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,403
There is a messenger,

181
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,407
and he never does anything to hurt people.

182
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,331
-There may be times when he hurts people--
-They say he's always alone.

183
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,668
He's alone in the dark.

184
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,254
No one should recognize him.

185
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,172
Why?

186
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,883
Because he must be alone.

187
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,598
You can't even imagine
how that feels, can you?

188
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,812
I think I can understand.

189
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,357
I was like that when I was little.

190
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,445
I wished...

191
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,740
nobody would look at me.

192
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,035
I wished nobody knew me

193
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,206
so that I could be alone.

194
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,633
Gosh, look at me again.

195
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,718
What? Why?

196
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,971
I'm saying useless things to you again.

197
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,765
My goodness.

198
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,232
But how did you know?

199
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,650
What? Know what?

200
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,527
How many pills I take.

201
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,363
Oh, well...

202
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,700
Don't most medications require two pills?

203
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,911
It's always two pills at a time.

204
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,038
That's the answer. Two.

205
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,041
I was right. Two.

206
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,558
Her name is Chae Yeong-sin.

207
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,729
I think she may be Mun-ho's secret girl
or something like that.

208
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,734
I know Mun-ho quite well.

209
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,113
I don't believe that.

210
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,117
Who is she?

211
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,201
I don't know.

212
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,037
I don't really want to know.

213
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,414
Why not?

214
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,084
In case she's young and pretty.

215
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,462
I still haven't recovered

216
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,340
from being dumped by your brother.

217
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,426
I feel bad about that too.

218
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,806
I was looking forward to calling you
my sister-in-law.

219
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,433
I mean it.

220
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,977
As someone who almost became
your sister-in-law,

221
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,938
may I ask you something?

222
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,064
Anything.

223
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,860
Do you know who Mun-ho's first love is?

224
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,030
He said...

225
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,574
the reason why he resigned

226
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,786
and went to a small unknown
Internet newspaper

227
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,624
is because he wants to repay a debt
to his first love.

228
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,667
To repay a debt?

229
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,461
He said it's weighing down on him.

230
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,589
I guess you didn't know about it either.

231
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:27,509
We don't share our deep, dark secrets.

232
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,388
Then I have nowhere else to investigate.

233
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,516
It's a dead end.

234
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,103
I better drink instead then.

235
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,234
Call Bae Sang-su

236
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,779
and get him to find out
everything about Chae Yeong-sin.

237
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,696
Now.

238
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,240
Is there anything in particular
that you would like to know?

239
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,204
I heard the grave is empty.

240
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,666
Weren't you the one

241
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,126
who put her to rest?

242
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,880
Find out if Chae Yeong-sin was adopted.

243
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,799
Adopted?

244
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,801
Yes, adopted.

245
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,595
If she was, find out when and how.

246
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,349
I want to know if she knows it or not.

247
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,478
I manage the website, artwork,
editing, and marketing.

248
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,271
Before I started working here...

249
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,983
Then create a video
for Someday's homepage.

250
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,735
Those are some examples
you can use as references.

251
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,861
Have it done by tomorrow.

252
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,655
Tomorrow?

253
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:34,284
Excuse me, but you can't just
assign projects like...

254
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,203
Go to the procurement agency.

255
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,664
Call that number and give them my name.

256
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,874
They will tell you what to find
and where to find them.

257
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,961
-And you...
-I'm Noh Seon-jae!

258
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,714
Get the documents from the list.
The goal is simple.

259
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,341
Find a connection
between Hwang Je-guk and Kim Ui-chan.

260
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,635
-Yes, sir!
-Move!

261
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,722
Excuse me.

262
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,142
You know, we have articles
that we publish daily and weekly.

263
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,768
We have some pending stories too.

264
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,187
If you use up all of our manpower,
how can we...

265
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,940
You mean collecting material
each production company sends you

266
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,400
to copy-and-paste online?

267
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,694
Chief, you and I can do that later.

268
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,320
Let's let them go investigate.

269
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,656
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

270
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,784
Kim Ui-chan told the reporters yesterday
that he can't drink

271
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,705
and that he has never been near
a gentleman's club.

272
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,290
He is dumbfounded at the claim.

273
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,793
This is a list of high-end clubs
in the neighborhood

274
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,336
where Hwang Je-guk frequently goes to.

275
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,671
Check each and every one.

276
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,007
Find out which one Hwang Je-guk goes to.

277
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,884
You look like a fast runner.

278
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,510
Do you want to be a frontline reporter?

279
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,262
I...

280
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,014
-If not, Yeong-sin?
-Yes?

281
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,224
Check every club and pub on that list.

282
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,394
Meet the women, bouncers,
as well as the head hostess, the drivers--

283
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,147
I'll do it.

284
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,565
I'll work hard.

285
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,358
Then you come with me.

286
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,028
Mun-ho.

287
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,239
-Mr. Kim.
-Excuse me?

288
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,365
Call me Mr. Kim.

289
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,785
Okay, Mr. Kim.

290
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,915
He's Park Bong-su,
and he's completely new to this.

291
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,583
We can't send him alone.

292
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,169
I'll go first and set things up
and then have him--

293
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,253
Come with me.

294
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,047
He's really a rookie.

295
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,009
Bong-su.

296
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,761
How much can I...

297
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,721
I mean, should I put up with?

298
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,181
I have my authority and...

299
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,265
I really...

300
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,725
You can't send him.

301
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,520
I'm off.

302
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,566
Please give me your number.

303
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,945
I'll need a number to call
in case of an emergency.

304
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,365
Your number is 010...

305
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,536
No, please add your number for me.

306
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
Thank you.

307
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,833
This way.

308
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,876
Excuse me. Pardon me.

309
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,503
I just texted you.

310
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,131
This is my mobile business card.

311
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,550
I got it yesterday. It's the newest model.

312
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,051
Okay then.

313
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,473
This way.

314
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,893
So this was the way out.

315
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,770
Good luck.

316
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,896
I'll do my best.

317
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,565
Park Bong-su.

318
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,902
I need to find out everything about

319
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,739
what Kim Mun-ho and his brother
are trying to pull.

320
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,741
Hello, Healer?

321
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,619
I just planted a bug
in Kim Mun-ho's cell phone.

322
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,456
Look through his phone
and link it with mine.

323
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,544
It's not too late.

324
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,880
If you get in a cab
and head to the airport--

325
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,550
Why are you making me repeat myself?

326
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,428
I'll say it one more time.

327
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,221
Tell this to Master.

328
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,516
I will only wait until sunset.

329
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,062
If he doesn't show up by then,

330
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,067
I'll never call him Master again.

331
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,988
One is a grown mutt
and the other is a puppy.

332
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,700
To think I've been partners
for over ten years with...

333
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,747
What are you planning to do?

334
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,249
Are you going to do
what Kim Mun-ho told you to?

335
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,417
Yes.

336
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,793
Why?

337
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,797
I have nothing to do until sunset anyway.

338
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,052
So, you'll visit the clubs
and investigate the story?

339
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,930
We don't do amateurish things like that.

340
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,181
You won't ask me to check

341
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,476
all the security camera footage
in the area, right?

342
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,436
-Would you do that?
-For free?

343
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,688
-Have I lost my mind?
-Exactly.

344
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,236
Tell Master that
the sun sets early nowadays.

345
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,663
What?

346
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,623
Well...

347
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,459
why are we going there again?

348
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,421
Why are you changing into your work outfit
in broad daylight?

349
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,049
I'm just curious.

350
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,805
You never give me an answer.

351
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,723
I feel sick, that's why.

352
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,602
I've felt queasy
ever since I went to that house.

353
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,812
I feel gassy too.

354
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,772
Do you have indigestion?

355
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,109
Do you want me to stop by a pharmacy?
You need medicine.

356
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,361
That's why I'm going so I can feel better.

357
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,156
I'll take care of other business
while I'm there too.

358
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,284
What are you talking about?

359
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,288
It's like you're speaking in
a secret code.

360
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,461
I just looked through Kim Mun-ho's phone.

361
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,174
There are records of him
requesting Chae Yeong-sin's DNA sample,

362
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,843
information about her life and her dreams,

363
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,971
and records of him transferring us money.

364
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,099
You're right. Our client was Kim Mun-ho.

365
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,769
But there is something I didn't tell you.

366
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,730
What?

367
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,650
Actually, he sent us
a new job request last night.

368
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,111
Why didn't you tell me?

369
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,447
Didn't you hear me this morning?

370
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,199
Didn't I say Healer was closing up shop
for a few days?

371
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,701
Closing up shop?

372
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,536
Look ahead.

373
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,706
So, what's the new job request?

374
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,917
"Keep Chae Yeong-sin safe."

375
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,210
Keep what?

376
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:22,799
He said to be especially wary
of Kim Mun-sik and Bae Sang-su's gang,

377
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,218
who he thinks is working for him.

378
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,555
Kim Mun-sik? That's his brother.

379
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:34,269
What is this suspicious and rotten smell
coming from this family?

380
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,031
-Do you know her?
-Of course. It's Oriana Palazzi.

381
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,158
She is my number one role model.

382
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,079
-Let's begin.
-Pardon?

383
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,997
You said she's your role model.

384
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,583
You know Palazzi
is the Queen of Interviews, right?

385
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,920
-That's freaking obvious--
-Speak clearly and with class.

386
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,838
Of course, I know it.

387
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,051
Have you ever conducted an interview?

388
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,928
I'm hurt.

389
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,847
I'm a veteran reporter
here at Someday News.

390
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,392
I've interviewed famous celebrities--

391
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,061
Chasing them like paparazzi?

392
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,690
Crawling around in someone's garage
to get their license plates?

393
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,570
Unlike other media companies,

394
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,159
Someday News don't get invited
by celebrities to parties.

395
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,410
It's only a B-class paper, right?

396
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,788
What do you do then?

397
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,998
Do you wait outside of the restaurant,

398
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,460
and if you make eye contact
with a celebrity as they leave,

399
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,711
publish an exclusive?

400
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,380
Is that it?

401
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,466
What? Is something wrong with that?

402
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,720
-Mun-ho, you are--
-Call me Mr. Kim.

403
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,347
Do you think

404
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,059
reporters who don't cover political
and economic sections like you are a joke?

405
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,646
I'm sorry, but the people of Korea

406
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,190
like entertainment news
more than politics or economics.

407
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:06,361
Ask the people on the street
what section of the news they read first.

408
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,531
Politics? No, it's entertainment.

409
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,869
How many people do you think
know the names of politicians?

410
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:18,206
But most of them know a good amount
of singers and lead actors in TV dramas,

411
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,624
and things like that.

412
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:25,630
So I gather information that people want,
even if it means crawling around garages--

413
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,591
-This Sunday...
-I'm not done talking.

414
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,800
So, I'll crawl around--

415
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,219
Kim Ui-chan will announce
his candidacy for mayor.

416
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:36,141
I'm thinking of sending you
to the press conference.

417
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:42,606
You must grab an opportunity to
ask about Hwang Je-guk and Joo Yeon-hui.

418
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,566
Directly to Kim Ui-chan.

419
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,444
In front of countless
cameras and microphones.

420
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,907
But it's not as easy as it sounds.

421
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,284
I'm going to teach you some skills.

422
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,120
Are you up for it?

423
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:05,962
I'll do it.

424
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,509
Hwang Je-guk is putting together
a huge legal team.

425
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,512
I'm not an expert in this field,

426
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,141
and we don't have
sufficient evidence either.

427
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,519
That's why we will need help.

428
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,980
I'm the witness.

429
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,485
I know what happened and how it happened.

430
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,904
What more evidence do we need?

431
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,032
I'm willing to tell everything

432
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,118
that I wish I could keep a secret forever.

433
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,328
Yeon-hui.

434
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,622
Tell them to search Hwang Je-guk's house.

435
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,374
The evidence is there.

436
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,294
He recorded everything he forced us to do.

437
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,545
So...

438
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,715
If we want to search his home
and seize evidence,

439
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,301
we need probable cause.

440
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:58,139
That means we need evidence.

441
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,268
What kind of law is that?

442
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,561
That is how the law works.

443
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,940
The ones up top know everything
and just evade it,

444
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,610
and the ones at the bottom stand by
and get caught.

445
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,031
Chi-su.

446
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,492
I'm in the middle of legal work.

447
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,746
Yeong-sin asked us to look after Yeon-hui.

448
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,207
I'm looking after her now.

449
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,377
Come on, you need another hand.

450
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,422
You couldn't even keep the reporters away.

451
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,092
That's why despicable articles about her
are popping up everywhere.

452
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,093
Hey!

453
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,015
That's why I called some of the boys.

454
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,936
-How have you been?
-Good.

455
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,439
Your head is so shiny.

456
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,606
Come here.

457
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,526
I was going to call just a couple of them,

458
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,446
but word got out.

459
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,865
They said they need to repay
their debt to you

460
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,450
and rushed over.

461
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,288
Guys, come and greet Mr. Chae.

462
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,750
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir!

463
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,598
What on earth?

464
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,230
-Hey!
-Hey!

465
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:36,988
I think so.

466
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,491
It's Healer, the one who handcuffed you...

467
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,776
Why is the door open?

468
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,144
Who are you?

469
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,187
Who the hell are you?

470
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,355
How did you get in?

471
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,524
I did some research before coming.

472
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,402
You collect many antiques, right?

473
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,487
Mr. Hwang.

474
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,294
You bought this last September
for 1.5 billion Won, right?

475
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,672
Hey! Is anyone outside...

476
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,300
Keep quiet or I'll destroy it.

477
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,178
Why, you psycho...

478
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:27,682
Like this.

479
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,185
Why, you psycho! How dare you!

480
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,697
You like hitting people, don't you?

481
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,073
But...

482
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,244
you haven't been hit much, have you?

483
00:29:56,044 --> 00:30:00,131
I wanted to end it quietly,
but I just can't help myself.

484
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,183
Stop! Please, stop!

485
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,392
Are you okay, sir?

486
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,187
Sir!

487
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,984
Oh, my.

488
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,152
Please spare me!

489
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,534
Here.

490
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,411
I have much more cash than this.

491
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,956
I have dollars in my room too.

492
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,125
My watch. Take this.

493
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,211
It's expensive.

494
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,048
Are you trying to make me
into a petty thief?

495
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,800
Why you...

496
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,885
Oh, my gosh!

497
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,805
Tell me, what do you need?

498
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,015
-I'll give you anything!
-Right.

499
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,726
I have something to ask you.

500
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,644
What is it?

501
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,729
You have a favorite club, right?

502
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,689
Excuse me?

503
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,982
The name of the club.

504
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,733
Lunar Moon.

505
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,861
-Lunar Moon?
-Yes.

506
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,487
-Thanks.
-Yes, sir.

507
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,488
Another thing.

508
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,787
Don't ever hit people again.

509
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,497
It hurts, right?

510
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,665
Yes, sir.

511
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,420
Especially, don't hit women.

512
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,715
A man hitting a woman is such a disgrace.

513
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,425
I won't, sir.

514
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,636
Where are the videos?

515
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,971
Excuse me? What...

516
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,391
The videos of the women.
Your main source for business.

517
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,398
Thanks.

518
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,745
Get a better safe.

519
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,873
This doesn't even take 30 seconds.

520
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,106
Oh, my gosh!

521
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,734
-Sir!
-Move out of the way!

522
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,722
What the heck were you guys doing?

523
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,683
Look at me!

524
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,727
How could this happen to
me in my own house?

525
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,438
Darn it!

526
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,315
My goodness!

527
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,843
I feel better now.

528
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:34,971
Have a seat.

529
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,729
I heard from Chief Kang Min-jae
that you are very close to Mun-ho.

530
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,105
Close...

531
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,483
Yes, that's right. We're very close.

532
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,237
You know Mun-ho is my brother, right?

533
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,614
Yes, of course.

534
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,868
Yes, I know.

535
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,662
You must know that he resigned.

536
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,372
I've heard.

537
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,542
So, I have a favor to ask.

538
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,878
Yes, anything.

539
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:12,008
This is going to be a difficult one.

540
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,890
I think I understand.

541
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,894
Do you want me to go to Mun-ho
and convince him to come back?

542
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,563
-Then--
-Please resign.

543
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,065
Excuse me?

544
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:31,903
Resign from the station
and go to my brother, Mun-ho.

545
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,534
If it's you, he will take you in.

546
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,870
That's what Chief Kang said.

547
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,121
But...

548
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,250
Mun-ho went to an Internet newspaper.

549
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,545
You want me to leave TV news and go...

550
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,214
Yes.

551
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,636
So, do you want me
to spy on him or something?

552
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,929
That's exactly it.

553
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,353
But sir, I...

554
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,063
Connect me to the head of human resources.

555
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,481
Okay, sir.

556
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,484
It won't be for long.

557
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,278
Stay beside Mun-ho for just a few months.

558
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,072
I'm transferring your call.

559
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,490
Yes, sir.

560
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,952
I'm going to send someone to you
named Lee Jong-su.

561
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,372
Prepare an employment contract
for the managing editor position.

562
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,668
I promised him I'll double his salary,
so please take care of it.

563
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,756
We will now begin a real-life interview.

564
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,841
The subject is me.

565
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,552
You want me to interview you? Now?

566
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,928
I know you have many questions.

567
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,889
For example, why is Kim Mun-ho here?

568
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,975
That's right. Why are you here?

569
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:44,934
Are you stupid?

570
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,061
Would I answer if you ask like that?

571
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,232
I'm sorry,

572
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,776
but we have a lot to talk about,
so if you could leave us...

573
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,027
Moron.

574
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,781
You have to be able to do interviews with
bombs going off in the middle of a war.

575
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,825
He said you can continue.

576
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,826
-Okay.
-Okay.

577
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,914
Excuse me, Reporter Kim.

578
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,085
Actually, I have an idea.

579
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:16,424
Things weren't so great for you
at your work, right?

580
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,427
You kept doing reports
that violated company policy--

581
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,678
Stop acting like you know.

582
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:25,391
If you act like you know a lot,
my instinct is to get defensive.

583
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,730
How much could I know?

584
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,648
But you know, it's very strange.

585
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,444
Sure, I could imagine
you quitting your job,

586
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,571
but this is so out of the blue.

587
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,822
What are you asking?

588
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,283
The question must be clear
so to get a clear answer.

589
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,078
So, why did you come to this company?

590
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,830
-What was that?
-What?

591
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,166
Would you answer
if someone asked like that?

592
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,335
Do reporters have no manners whatsoever?

593
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,879
Please.

594
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,840
If you feel uncomfortable
telling me everything,

595
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,634
you can just give me a hint.

596
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,386
A reporter who begs is detestable.

597
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,139
Forget it.

598
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,016
What? A veteran reporter?

599
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,602
Do you even know what veteran means?

600
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,946
-Throw your shoe or something.
-Pardon?

601
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,822
You need to grab my attention.

602
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,616
That's the only way
to continue the interview,

603
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,369
so take off your shoe
and throw it at me or something.

604
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,210
Uncle Mun-ho.

605
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,629
This is broken.

606
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,339
It's broken.

607
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,925
You have to fix it.

608
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,385
I have an exam tomorrow.

609
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,011
Give me a break.

610
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,264
I'm going to hate you.

611
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,766
Go right ahead.

612
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,061
I'm really going to hate you.

613
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,319
-What was that?
-I don't know.

614
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,698
You little peanut.

615
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,825
No, I'm not. I'm bigger.

616
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,036
I'm going to catch you and eat you up.

617
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,163
Get over here, Ji-an.

618
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,082
I'm going to eat you.

619
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,877
I got you.

620
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,507
I'm sorry we're home so late, Mun-ho.

621
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,802
If I fail my exam, it's because of you
and Gil-han.

622
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,680
Hey, don't say that to Mun-sik.

623
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,808
I heard he doesn't like it
when you babysit Ji-an.

624
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,228
Oh Ji-an, look at the time.
Why aren't you in bed?

625
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,855
Why were you bothering Uncle Mun-ho?

626
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,733
Do you want to sleep with Daddy?

627
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,485
No, I'm going to sleep with Uncle.

628
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,571
Uncle said he would tuck me in.

629
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,824
Uncle Mun-ho needs to go home.

630
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,909
Uncle.

631
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,793
You little peanut.

632
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,920
No, I'm not. I'm bigger.

633
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,883
It's done.

634
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,676
Thank you.

635
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,022
Here are some interview samples
for you to look over.

636
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,232
Okay. Thank you.

637
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,498
He didn't touch the cash in the safe

638
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,417
and only took the external hard drive.

639
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,920
What was on the external hard drive?

640
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,882
They are videos of Hwang Je-guk's girls
servicing the clients

641
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,885
from the club scenes to the hotel scenes.

642
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,931
He claims it was to keep the girls
under control.

643
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,850
He probably meant to use it
to blackmail his clients.

644
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,562
So, is Kim Ui-chan among them?

645
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,980
He said Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan

646
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,858
usually met Joo Yeon-hui at her apartment.

647
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,528
How much was caught on camera?

648
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,905
The camera was only in the living room.

649
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,075
All they captured
was them drinking together.

650
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,285
I know Kim Ui-chan.

651
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,704
He has very dirty habits.

652
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,518
Those trees won't last the winter
with that.

653
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,312
Rice straws won't be enough.

654
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,022
What if we attach some sap to it?

655
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,482
Okay, I'll do that.

656
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,486
You may freeze before the trees.

657
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,030
It's cold. Just take it easy.

658
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,173
Why are you back so early?

659
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,342
What is this? You sound displeased.

660
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,679
What did you do today?

661
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,681
There is a Chilean Wine Expo.

662
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,934
So, I did some research online
to order some.

663
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,355
I also read half of the book you gave me.

664
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,525
And?

665
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,613
Look in the direction I look.

666
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,998
What are you looking at?

667
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,842
The sun will soon set that way.

668
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,261
The sky is unbelievable these days.

669
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,848
The colors of the sunset are so pretty.

670
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,567
When will the sun set?

671
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,281
You're so impatient.

672
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,492
You will never change, will you?

673
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,167
I like it right now.

674
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,754
I wish time would stop right now.

675
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,339
Don't you feel the same, Mun-sik?

676
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,967
Look at all of us.

677
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,262
-Hey!
-Hit.

678
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,930
-Hit.
-Hey!

679
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,099
Okay, good.

680
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,562
Right! If I go slowly, you won't learn.

681
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,981
-Let go!
-Good!

682
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,607
I disagree.

683
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,944
Why?

684
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,029
Everything is unclear.

685
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,823
Nothing is for sure.

686
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,450
You want to continue living like this?

687
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:00,995
Well, I don't.

688
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,957
But don't you have
the most stable future among us?

689
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,543
You'll take over the junkyard.

690
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,131
Right? President Kim.

691
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,262
Owning a junkyard
isn't enough for you, is it?

692
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,018
You're going to become a reporter

693
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,228
just like Gil-han.

694
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,065
I heard you're applying
to the same newspaper company.

695
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,443
That's right.

696
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,279
Jun-seok is applying as well.

697
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,406
Do you want to become a reporter too?

698
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,491
There's no way he wants to become one.

699
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,288
He's very simple.

700
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,458
He just wants to stay right next to you.

701
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,545
Come on, you punk. Just ask her.

702
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,172
Tell her you like her.

703
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,841
Ask how she feels about you.

704
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,763
That way, you can start something
or get over your feelings.

705
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,475
I think you'll be completely rejected,
but so what?

706
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,268
You'll drink all night long.

707
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,855
Then, you'll shake it off,
and go back to being friends.

708
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,651
Take care of it quickly.

709
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,861
Thoughts like that are like worms.

710
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,239
They will eat up our friendship
if you keep doing this.

711
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,049
Wow, look at the sunset.

712
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,388
The sky is starting to change its color.

713
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,923
COME TO THE ROOFTOP NOW
FROM HEALER

714
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,430
THIS IS A GIFT FROM HWANG JE-GUK'S SAFE

715
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,438
Wait.

716
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,482
You're still here, aren't you?

717
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,277
You need to confirm that I'm taking this.

718
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,030
So you're still here, aren't you?

719
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,032
You're watching me, right?

720
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,994
Let's talk.

721
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,248
I won't look.

722
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,750
See?

723
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:38,128
I'm covering my eyes.

724
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,425
I can't see a thing.

725
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,262
So please, talk to me.

726
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,934
I have something to ask you.

727
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,852
So...

728
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,357
if you're Healer, please answer me.

729
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,734
I won't keep you long.

730
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:05,239
I'll just ask with my eyes
covered like this.

731
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:24,049
What do you want to ask me?

732
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,053
Are you really Healer?

733
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,389
Yes, I am.

734
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,600
Last time...

735
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,354
you saved me in that alley, right?

736
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,944
When I was being dragged away
by those thugs,

737
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,029
you showed up and saved me.

738
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,701
You also gave me my medicine,

739
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,497
and you held me in your arms, right?

740
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,209
You're also the one

741
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,548
who took my bag

742
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,635
and clipped my nail in the bathroom.

743
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,179
Right?

744
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:15,809
And today,

745
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:19,688
you gave me this as a gift.

746
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,193
But why are you doing this?

747
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,868
This is just my guess.

748
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,163
My imagination may be running wild.

749
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,042
I tend to do that,
so I'll just throw it out there.

750
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,547
Did you take my nail clipping

751
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,509
to run a DNA test on me?

752
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,725
And you've been watching over me
ever since then, right?

753
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:02,439
That's how you were able to show up
and save me from those thugs that night.

754
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,526
But why?

755
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,571
Are you...

756
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,576
my real father?

757
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,166
Or my brother?

758
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:29,424
That DNA test was to see
if I'm related to someone, wasn't it?

759
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,638
Why else would you do all this for me?

760
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,819
Who are you?

761
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,948
Who am I?

762
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,920
I told you.

763
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,505
Excuse me?

764
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,551
Don't be stupid and follow anyone.

765
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,762
Be careful of people who come close to you

766
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,598
and are nice to you.

767
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,977
What do you mean?

768
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,729
Why?

769
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:43,915
Excuse me.

770
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,336
Are you still there?

771
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,383
Did you leave?

772
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,786
The sunset is so beautiful.

773
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,121
The fading sunset means...

774
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,999
The sun is almost fully set.

775
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,753
It means Jeong-hu will get
completely mad at you soon,

776
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:33,173
and turn into a raging bull
freed from its pen.

777
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,258
It's been a while, Detective Jo.

778
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,843
How was the South Pacific?

779
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,054
It was blue and hot.

780
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,849
I see you were worried
about your apprentice after all.

781
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,727
My apprentice probably went
to his house by now, right?

782
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,771
I'm sure he did.

783
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,440
Detective Jo, do you believe in destiny?

784
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:56,613
I believe in my gimbap roller
more than in destiny.

785
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,490
It works really well.

786
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,367
Very convenient and handy.

787
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:05,872
It was around this time in 1981
when I was locked up.

788
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,083
You were famous.

789
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,503
I heard they beat you half to death
asking for names.

790
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:15,048
But the detectives beating you
got sick of you and gave up,

791
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,800
saying you were impossible.

792
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:24,516
I believed that as long as
I kept my mouth shut,

793
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,977
the other four would live happily.

794
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,020
That's what I thought.

795
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,941
But 11 years later, when you got out,

796
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:37,028
two of the four friends were dead
and one was a paraplegic.

797
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,739
Only one was extremely successful.

798
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,033
You said it was suspicious.
Why didn't you investigate?

799
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,202
Investigate what? The truth?

800
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,288
And if I knew the truth,

801
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,624
would that make me happy?

802
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,167
Happy?

803
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,884
Why do words like that
make my insides twist?

804
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,847
"I hope you'll be happy.
I hope you become rich."

805
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,308
What a load of crap.

806
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:09,561
That's why they say there is
a thin line between truth and crap.

807
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,647
That's why I decided to bury everything.

808
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,900
-Detective Jo.
-What?

809
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,278
Even a crap-like truth
must have a destiny.

810
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,864
That's why it draws people in.

811
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:24,200
That's why Jeong-hu
is being dragged along too.

812
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,746
The truth doesn't necessarily
end in happiness.

813
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,915
It may end in a disaster.

814
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,666
But it's inevitable.

815
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,460
Since it's destiny.

816
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,255
Who are you?

817
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,508
Who am I?

818
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,271
They say he's always alone.

819
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,648
He's alone in the dark.

820
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,151
I think I can understand.

821
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,321
I wished nobody would look at me.

822
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,782
I wished nobody knew me.

823
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,745
That camera is malfunctioning.

824
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,957
It will continue to record an empty room.

825
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,255
It will get noisy if you call for people.

826
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,966
Then your wife will wake up.

827
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:30,678
Are you...

828
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,641
the man they call Healer?

829
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,767
Bingo.

830
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,602
Have a seat.

831
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,206
Turn your chair toward the screens.

832
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,881
You are the one who hired me

833
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,843
to get that video file

834
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,719
from Ko Seong-cheol, correct?

835
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:17,767
You're also the one
who murdered Ko Seong-cheol

836
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,563
and framed me for it.

837
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,690
I don't know what you're talking about.

838
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,277
A video worth killing a person over.

839
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,654
It's impressive.

840
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:34,159
But my hacking skills
are pretty extraordinary.

841
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:40,957
I can easily slip in a video like this
into any TV stations' nine o'clock news.

842
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,128
So that anyone and everyone

843
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,382
can watch it live, nationwide.

844
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,802
I heard that the messenger Healer

845
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,639
is highly reliable.

846
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,311
And he would never steal
the client's possession

847
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,939
or keep a copy like this
or anything like that.

848
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,568
That was true
until I was framed for murder.

849
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,739
If you need money, just tell me how much.

850
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,868
Can't you think outside the box?

851
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,370
Everyone says the same thing.

852
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,498
"I don't know what you are talking about.

853
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,500
How much do you want?"

854
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,378
I'm so sick of it.

855
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,444
What do you want?

856
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:52,904
The real murderer.

857
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:59,077
If you hand over the real murderer
to the police in three days,

858
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,205
that video will never see
the light of day.

859
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,335
You expect me to believe you?

860
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,256
As you said, I'm a businessman
who lives off on my reputation.

861
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,634
I can't have word getting out

862
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,262
that I stole
a client's possession like this.

863
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,473
I'll give you three days.

864
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,352
Are you the one...

865
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,564
who broke into Hwang Je-guk's safe?

866
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,693
That's confidential.

867
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,654
My apologies.

868
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,293
That security button is broken.

869
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,169
You'll have to get it fixed.

870
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,029
Jun-seok.

871
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:21,826
You're Jun-seok, right?

872
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:23,911
Right?

873
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,488
What warning?

874
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:02,158
Don't personally contact
Chae Yeong-sin ever again.

875
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,951
Where did you get it?

876
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,663
Do you know anything
about night messengers?

877
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,040
Jun-seok had a son, didn't he?

878
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,750
Jeong-hu. Seo Jeong-hu.

879
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:12,710
You've met him?

880
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,545
You saw Healer's face?

881
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:18,257
May I ask what you hired him to do?

882
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,094
That is everything about Chae Yeong-sin.

883
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,638
An informant came forward. Awesome.

884
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,724
Hello? Is anyone out there?

885
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,810
