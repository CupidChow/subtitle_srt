00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,765
THE LATE SEO JUN-SEOK

2
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,296
MARCH 2, 1992, TESTIMONY OF SEO JUN-SEOK

3
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,593
MARCH 2, 1992, TESTIMONY OF SEO JUN-SEOK

4
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,543
-I've brought the tape.
-Really?

5
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,258
We will record your testimony now.

6
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,762
March 2, 1992.

7
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,806
Name, Seo Jun-seok.

8
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,770
I listened to your dad's statement.

9
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,814
What did he say?

10
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,192
Your father, Jun-seok,
wasn't a murder suspect to begin with.

11
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,904
Your dad went to the police
to report a murder.

12
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,324
He said those guys
killed his friend, Oh Gil-han.

13
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,120
He went to the police
and even brought pictures as proof.

14
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,710
His testimony was of a witness
and not a suspect.

15
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:53,298
He talked about
how those goons killed Gil-han,

16
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,258
and what they were doing at the scene.

17
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,145
Jeong-hu, this is plenty.

18
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,272
Come back, okay?

19
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,524
This is enough for the broadcast.

20
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,027
What do you think?

21
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,947
What do I think about the bastards
who killed my dad,

22
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,242
framed yours for murder,
and screwed up our lives?

23
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,411
Let's proceed as planned.

24
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,413
Let's see this through.

25
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,419
There was another lonely death.

26
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,383
Park Dong-cheol was kicked out
for blowing the whistle on the matter.

27
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,929
But he kept an audio tape
for the past 22 years.

28
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,390
It was of Seo Jun-seok's statement.

29
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,683
Yeong-sin, throw it!

30
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,478
I suspect Park Dong-cheol

31
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,649
was killed by the people
trying to destroy that tape.

32
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:58,238
Because the 22-year-old tape
that he gave us just before he died

33
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,741
had some incredible stories about them.

34
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,829
Wait, wait!

35
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,165
Let me meet Boss.

36
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,839
What a nice house.

37
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,885
Who are these people he referred to?

38
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,973
A reporter at Someday
went somewhere to ask just who they are.

39
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,477
This person is only referred to as Boss.

40
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,246
Hello.

41
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,416
The man you're hiding

42
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,709
is Boss, isn't it?

43
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,585
Hello, I'm with Someday News.

44
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,587
May I ask you a question?

45
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,631
Is that a no?

46
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,843
These people must be working for Boss!

47
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,386
I will ask these men instead.

48
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,638
Would Boss let you hurt a reporter

49
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,056
on a live feed

50
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,183
or let him get beaten up?

51
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,395
Careful.
I'll get in trouble if that breaks.

52
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,362
His name is Park Bong-su.

53
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,114
He has a business card from Someday News.

54
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,335
Didn't you say you were Healer?

55
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,922
I heard you'd meet me if I said that.

56
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,508
If you are Healer,

57
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,636
I will make time to talk to you.

58
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,055
If not--

59
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,307
Will you kill me?

60
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,059
I really don't want to die.

61
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,561
So, tell me.

62
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,897
Are you really Boss?

63
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,860
Do you control men like Oh Tae-won
who goes around killing people?

64
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,113
If you were curious,
all you needed to do was ask.

65
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,240
You didn't have to take my picture.

66
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,575
Well, you see...

67
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,994
I had no choice.

68
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:16,209
If someone bothers you
or if you don't like them,

69
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,794
you kill them.

70
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,921
Meanwhile, we can't.

71
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,216
It's so unfair.

72
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,594
That's why I need
to get your face out there

73
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,471
and put a warning under it.

74
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,223
"Beware of the beast."

75
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,816
Do people thank you for that?

76
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,693
I don't know

77
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,113
because I haven't done this before.

78
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,668
Kid.

79
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,338
Who are you really?

80
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,049
Among the people
that someone like you killed

81
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,052
was a man named Seo Jun-seok.

82
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,513
I'm his son,

83
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,349
Seo Jeong-hu.

84
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,643
Mister.

85
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,813
When you kill people from now on,

86
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,734
think about their sons and daughters.

87
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,656
You never did until now, did you?

88
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,831
Look.

89
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,584
The video ended mid-interview here.

90
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,169
This is the house.

91
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,712
Please wait.

92
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,381
We need orders to take action.

93
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,300
By the time you do, it'll be--

94
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,303
We can't barge into any house
just because we're police officers.

95
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,929
Are you kidding me?

96
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,144
We can't reach our reporter
in Boss' house.

97
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,855
YEONG-SIN IS FILMING AT BOSS' HOUSE

98
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,609
We just received a new video.

99
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,112
A reporter at Someday news
is filming the front of the house.

100
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,198
The police seem to have arrived.

101
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,729
It's been a very long time since we had

102
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,439
such a young person in this house.

103
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,358
Come, have a seat.

104
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,017
Have a drink.

105
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,896
I don't drink with thugs
who killed my father.

106
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,409
You're mistaken.

107
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,497
We don't kill people.

108
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,332
You order others to do your dirty work.

109
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,715
We work to save everyone.

110
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,634
How do I explain this?

111
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,262
You keep saying "we"
which is pissing me off.

112
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:01,183
How many bastards like you are there?

113
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,604
There is us, who look after people,

114
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,274
and then those who have us
look after them.

115
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,276
Young man,

116
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,404
which do you want to be?

117
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,700
You talk too much.

118
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,372
I thought you were some formidable figure,

119
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,755
but you're just an old man

120
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,717
who just wants to talk.

121
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,347
I'm telling you that
I've grown fond of you.

122
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,601
Think about it, but I won't wait long.

123
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,941
We will record your testimony now.

124
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,654
March 2, 1992.

125
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,572
Name, Seo Jun-seok.

126
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,491
Those people

127
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,078
call themselves "farmers,"

128
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,874
which is insulting to real farmers.

129
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,838
Hi.

130
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,340
Oh Gil-han, Choi Myeong-hui, and I

131
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,302
had chased these farmers
for over a year now.

132
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,014
We got a tip that they were
secretly moving a truck.

133
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,892
We figured it was a slush fund.

134
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,479
That's what

135
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,066
these so-called farmers do.

136
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,365
They think our nation
is their vegetable garden.

137
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,870
They play with politics
by funding politicians

138
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,037
to fit their taste buds.

139
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,042
They make laws that they want
and profit from them.

140
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,100
Hey, miss.

141
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,269
You can't go in there!

142
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,536
Jeong-hu, what's wrong?

143
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,539
I keep wanting to sleep.

144
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,086
Why are you always sleeping
whenever I see you?

145
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,631
You're always waking me up.

146
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,469
Did they drug you?
Should we go to the hospital?

147
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,061
I'll sleep it off.

148
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,279
Is that him? Is he okay?

149
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,614
He's sleepy.

150
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:47,993
We found him.

151
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,835
-Yeong-sin.
-Yes? Do you need something?

152
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,257
Our dads were very close, right?

153
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,677
Yes.

154
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,347
Yes, they were thick as thieves.

155
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,059
I wish you could've seen the broadcast.

156
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,562
Tell me about it.

157
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,646
You know,

158
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,899
you're a reporter too.

159
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,651
Watch the news a little.

160
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,195
Please.

161
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,789
That day in 1992,

162
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,877
our dads went out to investigate a story.

163
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,891
-Take good pictures.
-Don't worry.

164
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,603
-Make sure they're in focus.
-When were they not?

165
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,938
I just never told you, but you...

166
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,858
-Wait, what's that?
-Isn't it awesome?

167
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,402
-It's a recent model.
-It's expensive.

168
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,653
-Let me try it on.
-Hey!

169
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,864
-Stay still.
-What?

170
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,241
-Hey.
-Have you lost your mind?

171
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,577
-Hey!
-You'll break it.

172
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,205
-I'm trying it on.
-No!

173
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,457
Just once.

174
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,420
At first, they thought they'd get
pictures of the money exchange.

175
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,799
In their minds,
it was a quick and easy job.

176
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,482
What's that?

177
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,527
As you can see...

178
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,584
It's 200 million won per box.

179
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,879
I saw at least ten boxes.

180
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,674
That's 2 billion won
per truckload of paint.

181
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,010
I want that paint container.

182
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,721
What are you thinking?

183
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,766
They wouldn't kill me.
I'm a reporter after all.

184
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,268
What if they kill you?

185
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,020
That'll never happen.

186
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,483
What was that?

187
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,614
I'll lure them.
You get the paint container.

188
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,949
Hey!

189
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,450
Who the fuck are you?

190
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,910
Get him!

191
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,080
Stop right there!

192
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,509
Wait. Hold on.

193
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,263
-Hello.
-Who are you?

194
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,309
-What are you doing?
-You can't take that!

195
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,853
Stop!

196
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,575
-What's wrong?
-Gil-han's in danger.

197
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,951
So...

198
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,538
Wait here. I'll get Gil-han.

199
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,206
Keep the car running.

200
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,502
Let go! Hey!

201
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,465
Gil-han...

202
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,218
-Gil-han is--
-Jun-seok!

203
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,596
-Hurry.
-But Gil-han...

204
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,686
Gil-han... Gil-han!

205
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,743
Write down the license plate number.

206
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,661
Yes, sir.

207
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,206
I ran and hid for days

208
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,834
and found out what that paint was.

209
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,876
COMPONENT ANALYSIS

210
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,426
This is fake minium.

211
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,765
When poured over steel frames,

212
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,352
it will speed up the corrosion.

213
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,942
It's usually applied to prevent rust,

214
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,989
but it does the exact opposite!

215
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,413
Hey!

216
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,881
That's where the recording ends.

217
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,091
Our old men

218
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,469
led such tiring lives.

219
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,722
I know.

220
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,392
It's over.

221
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,604
-What is?
-My homework.

222
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,982
My master, my dad,

223
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,109
and you.

224
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,992
Good job.

225
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,964
-Yeong-sin.
-What?

226
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,842
I thought about this while I was sleeping.

227
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,011
As if that's possible.

228
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,264
Is it hard to just live
like ordinary people?

229
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,645
Is that how you want to live?

230
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,231
Will it be hard for me?

231
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,236
Let's give that "ordinary life" a try.

232
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,321
Will you be by my side?

233
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,864
Of course.

234
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,242
Good.

235
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,684
I thought you were preparing
Ji-an's birthday dinner.

236
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,979
I did a simple one at lunch.

237
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,731
I thought you had an episode.

238
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,235
Yes, but it was brief.

239
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,786
Please don't be sick.

240
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,331
I'm going to try not to be.

241
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,096
I watched Mun-ho's broadcast.

242
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,934
I hoped you wouldn't have.

243
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,230
Were you okay

244
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,774
after seeing that?

245
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,447
How much did you know?
What haven't you told me?

246
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,367
There is nothing that I haven't told you.

247
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,999
I was waiting in the car that day.

248
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,918
Jun-seok ran in
and said we had to take off.

249
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,962
I did what I was asked.

250
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:23,342
I never told you,
but I always suspected Jun-seok.

251
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,969
I'm glad I was proven wrong.

252
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,727
This soup is good.

253
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,354
Is it a consommé?

254
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,906
I tried a new recipe. Do you like it?

255
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,496
Close your eyes just once.
Then open them again.

256
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:40,043
You'll see things you didn't see before.

257
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,883
That is called "maturing".

258
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,058
I...

259
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,186
saw everything.

260
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,981
Jun-seok...

261
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,735
killed Gil-han.

262
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,202
We were

263
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,540
following the truck
supposedly transporting a slush fund.

264
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,918
When we arrived at the scene,

265
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,213
the truck driver saw us and ran off.

266
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,969
Inside the truck
were boxes filled with cash.

267
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,806
They started fighting over the money.

268
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,100
Jun Seok wanted to keep it,

269
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,769
but Gil-han said he shouldn't.

270
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,106
That's when Jun-seok killed him,

271
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,066
his own friend.

272
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,236
I couldn't stop him.

273
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,698
That's how money is.

274
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,035
Or maybe that's how people are.

275
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,829
Sorry?

276
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,707
Oh, the money?

277
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,752
It was revealed to be
the Democratic Party's funds.

278
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,921
Isn't it scary?

279
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:12,510
That money made my friends
kill and be killed.

280
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,388
It broke. That's sad.

281
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,767
I tried to be careful
even though I was running around all day.

282
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,310
Well,

283
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,773
your mom must be a very good cook.

284
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,443
Dad, if you go to her house,

285
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,737
the kitchen counters and sink
are down here.

286
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,906
They must have built it
to accommodate her wheelchair.

287
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,826
If she cares for the kitchen that much,

288
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,705
there is no question
that she's a great cook.

289
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,004
-Dad, have some.
-No, have some first.

290
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,256
But I brought it for you to try. Here.

291
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,685
-It's good. It's not too sweet either.
-Right?

292
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,443
So when is that punk coming?

293
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,071
Which punk? You know I have so many.

294
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,074
Drag him here.

295
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,578
Will you beat him up?

296
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,331
Why must it be someone so frail?

297
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,625
You're vulnerable to violence

298
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,253
which is why I hoped you'd find a big guy

299
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:14,549
into whose arms you can hop in and hide.

300
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:20,597
Why does it have to be
a scaredy-cat and crybaby?

301
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,017
Why are you laughing?

302
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,729
Was that funny?

303
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,356
Hey.

304
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:33,526
-Why are you laughing?
-A scaredy-cat and a crybaby?

305
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,778
Is that funny?

306
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,289
-How did you get in?
-Through the window.

307
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,211
-Step back one meter.
-Why?

308
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,754
Back off a bit more.

309
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,759
You said you want to live
like ordinary people.

310
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,219
Let's talk on the bed.

311
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,428
Then first,

312
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,681
use the door when you come
to your girlfriend's house.

313
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,641
Fine.

314
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,560
Second,

315
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,146
if you want to date your girlfriend,

316
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,984
meet her father and ask for his approval.

317
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,986
That's a bit...

318
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,571
Third,

319
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,201
give your girlfriend a gift
on her birthday.

320
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,204
Today is my real birthday.

321
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,376
Right.

322
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,796
Ta-da.

323
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,970
Gifts should be new and wrapped.

324
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,681
The tracker on your phone was disabled.

325
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,933
This is can be a GPS tracker.

326
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,852
Unbelievable.

327
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,354
Are you saying that you'd stalk me?

328
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,357
No, you can turn it on when you want.

329
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,692
You can turn it off too.

330
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:59,904
When you feel like you're in danger,
turn it on.

331
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,532
Otherwise, keep it turned off.

332
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,702
Okay.

333
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,213
-Thanks.
-May I hug you now?

334
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,553
-Do I frustrate you?
-No.

335
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,138
Then why are you pushing me away?

336
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,976
You said you want to love
like ordinary people.

337
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,480
Love?

338
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,482
Yes, love.

339
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,484
Then what's this?

340
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,235
This is

341
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,573
something that's not quite ordinary.

342
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,036
Got it.

343
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,664
I'll take all the necessary steps,
so just wait.

344
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,209
Don't take too long.

345
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,836
Meet your dad and get a regular paycheck.

346
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:01,382
And use this thing called a door...

347
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,903
I can't do this.

348
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,656
I think

349
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,535
I should come back some other time.

350
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:33,081
Chi-su, I forgot the...

351
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,806
Hello, sir.

352
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,144
I came today to introduce myself properly.

353
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,398
I need to get your approval too.

354
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,193
Well, I'm sorry.

355
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,207
Why are you in there?

356
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,050
-Don't come in.
-Dad.

357
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,220
You come in, and he's dead.

358
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,898
Go easy on him, okay?

359
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,076
Look.

360
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:56,039
I will ask you a few questions.

361
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,248
Sure.

362
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,003
That day before, at the cafe...

363
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,923
You and my daughter...

364
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,342
Well...

365
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,931
I was standing right there!

366
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,349
Chi-su, please.

367
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,645
Let's find out more before we kill him.

368
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,355
Chi-su, no!

369
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,564
Calm down

370
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,858
and have a seat.

371
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,527
Please sit.

372
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,114
I'll ask him instead.

373
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,414
-So, first...
-Yes, sir.

374
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,709
How far did you two go...

375
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,253
What the hell?

376
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,840
How was the pollack soup?

377
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,968
I really enjoyed it.

378
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,053
See? It was him.

379
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,932
He's the one she nursed all night long!

380
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,101
Chi-su!

381
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,312
You! How dare you kiss her in front of me!

382
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,314
No, Chi-su! You can't kill him!

383
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,566
Stop.

384
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,569
Do you think a lawyer can't throw a punch?

385
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,571
-Get over here.
-I'm sorry, sir.

386
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,532
Sorry? You're not even married.

387
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:13,950
You should wait

388
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,368
until you're married.

389
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,036
I didn't do anything wrong.

390
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,913
-What?
-Chi-su, stop!

391
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,083
-Chi-su!
-Hey!

392
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,506
-You. Get over here!
-Chi-su!

393
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,383
I'm sorry!

394
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,718
-Chi-su!
-What are you sorry for?

395
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,264
I really didn't do anything to her.

396
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:13,301
We just got a tip
that I'm not quite sure of.

397
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,594
What was the tip?

398
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,804
Someone said he met Boss.

399
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,389
Did you get his information?

400
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,307
Well, not exactly.

401
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:23,686
Take a look at Someday's website.
Things keep popping up.

402
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,776
I THINK I'VE SEEN THE OLD MAN SOMEWHERE

403
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,072
IS HE A KILLER?

404
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,700
We'll create a program for gathering tips.

405
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,831
We'll collect anything about Boss
and the minium incident in 1992.

406
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,918
Find the useful ones
and double check them.

407
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,836
Interview tipsters in person if possible.

408
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,674
If we're going to do
Kim Mun-sik's counter-broadcast,

409
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,468
we'll need more manpower.

410
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,015
Here comes reinforcement.

411
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,892
Hello. It's me, Park Bong-su.

412
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,562
You idiot.
How dare a rookie go undercover?

413
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,898
You did great. Good job.

414
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,527
You did a great job!

415
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,446
We missed you!

416
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,115
He said he wants to live
like ordinary people.

417
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,409
Let's go out tonight.

418
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,328
It's not easy to live
like ordinary people.

419
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,540
I don't think he knows what that means.

420
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,041
What's so great about it anyway?

421
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,212
But I think that's what he truly wants
seeing how he came back as Park Bong-su.

422
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,756
Good job.

423
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,011
He quit being Healer too,
but I think he was laid off.

424
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,054
He got fired.

425
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,019
Myeong-hui talked about you a lot
on the phone.

426
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,438
Really? What did she say?

427
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,608
She wants to see you again
and asked me to set it up.

428
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,861
She wants a Choi Myeong-hui special.

429
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:55,987
She does?

430
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,030
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

431
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,949
Let's do that special!

432
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:05,037
I know someone who seems to live
in a different world.

433
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:10,168
It's true.
He did live in a different world.

434
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,589
I worked on Seodo Bridge in 1992.

435
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,048
You know what happened, right?

436
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,801
It collapsed before it opened.

437
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,180
We talked about it a lot back then.

438
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,934
They suddenly asked us
to switch the coating.

439
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,813
What happened to the company
that built the bridge?

440
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,648
Isn't it obvious?

441
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,193
It was acquired just before it went under.

442
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,487
-May I go now?
-Yes. Thank you for your help.

443
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,958
Are you sleepy?

444
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,671
But now, he wants to join our world
and live like ordinary people.

445
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,092
It's kind of funny and sad to see.

446
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,010
Okay.

447
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,388
-Let's go to Yeongdeungpo.
-Wait, Yeongdeungpo...

448
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,433
That's so far.
It will take us forever to get there.

449
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,645
I saw Boss with my own eyes.

450
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,606
I was an assemblyman's aide
seven years ago.

451
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,108
He wanted a legislature passed,
and our assemblyman...

452
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,861
You know how felines are.

453
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,864
They sleep unless they're hunting.

454
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,741
He's just like them.

455
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,285
His paycheck is such a waste.

456
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,788
Park Bong-su.

457
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,582
Yes?

458
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,127
Your paycheck was deposited. Please check.

459
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:37,964
Okay.

460
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,341
My salary...

461
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,183
Ms. Jo, how much was my pay?

462
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,353
After deductions here and there,
it's a little over 900,000 won.

463
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,356
Wait.

464
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,734
After a full month's work?

465
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,612
You took a bunch of days off too.

466
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,950
So 900,000 won for a month's work.

467
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,914
Should I take on some part-time jobs?

468
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:16,168
-If they're simple enough--
-By the way, return that earpiece.

469
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,213
-Why?
-You quit, remember?

470
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,383
You shouldn't hold onto company property.

471
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,261
Come on. How can you say that?

472
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,596
Are you kidding me?

473
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,015
Darn.

474
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,851
-Get your act together!
-Her and her temper.

475
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,315
Black box!

476
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,110
Don't you see those things
in all those cars?

477
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,740
What can I do?

478
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,492
Every street has parked cars.

479
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,829
That's why your predecessor
stayed on rooftops!

480
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,749
Isn't it a simple dream?

481
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,459
He just wants to live like everyone else.

482
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:02,089
Still, that's what he wants,
so I'm letting him be.

483
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:08,262
He's a bit older than I am,
but he acts like a 13-year-old.

484
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,515
That's why I have to look out for him.

485
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,809
Is that friend a guy?

486
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,519
Yes.

487
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,147
-A guy you like?
-No.

488
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,400
Yes.

489
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,619
You said you have another interview.

490
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:36,290
Yes, but I have time.
The meeting is nearby.

491
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,667
Let's see.

492
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,512
Look at me, please.

493
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,810
Would you mind speaking casually to me?

494
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:57,812
Shall I?

495
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,358
Close your eyes.

496
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,615
All done.

497
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,702
Right, the interview.

498
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,455
You're going to watch
Kim Mun-sik's interview, right?

499
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:25,297
I don't think that's related to the man
that we know of.

500
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,591
Excuse me, sir.

501
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:32,012
We can't do a broadcast
on your wife who ran away.

502
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,264
I'm sorry.

503
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:35,933
Hey.

504
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,477
Bong-su.

505
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,229
Park Bong-su!

506
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,899
-Yes?
-Answer the phone.

507
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,739
Sorry, wrong number.

508
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,326
Bong-su!

509
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,079
Will you move?

510
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,294
-We can do it like that.
-Sure.

511
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,589
Sir, I think we're doomed.

512
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,633
-Why?
-Mr. Kim's interview will be off script.

513
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,803
-What? Why?
-I just found out myself.

514
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,723
Mr. Kim told them
as soon as he got to the studio

515
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,185
that he's doing the interview
without a script.

516
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,272
Chief Kang is so stressed out right now.

517
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,483
Things are really tense.

518
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,699
INTERVIEW WITH KIM MUN-SIK,
NEW REPRESENTATIVE OF JEONGMIN PARTY

519
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,039
Sir, this is a live broadcast.

520
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:43,584
-If you say anything wrong--
-Don't worry and just relax.

521
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,004
Chief Kang,

522
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,381
ask me anything you want.

523
00:41:55,095 --> 00:42:00,100
I know that people are talking about

524
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:04,563
the conflict between me
and my brother, Kim Mun-ho.

525
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,567
Yes, some question
your ability to manage Seoul

526
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,363
since you can't even
manage your own family.

527
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,159
My brother and I are both reporters.

528
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,162
I first became a reporter in 1980.

529
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:25,376
My brother is popular
because of this series,

530
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:30,256
but I was a member of that
pirate radio broadcast he mentioned.

531
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,802
I even brought a picture. May I show it?

532
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,888
-Yes, I'd like to see it.
-Okay.

533
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,766
Let's see.

534
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,978
Of the five friends, this is me.

535
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,438
This is my wife.

536
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,152
I fought for freedom of press
during those harsh times.

537
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:57,700
So even if my brother is wrong,
I must let him be

538
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:03,038
to protect the freedom of speech
that I fought for.

539
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,626
Pirate radio broadcasts
are a bit foreign to me.

540
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,672
What do we do about our broadcast
now that he's off script?

541
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,799
It was like that back then.

542
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:14,800
It's canceled.

543
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,012
-We weren't allowed to report much.
-All right.

544
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,099
So, we had to do pirate radio broadcasts.

545
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:28,564
Honestly, the press
has too much freedom these days.

546
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:34,111
I hope you know that
past generations sacrificed a great deal

547
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,072
so that you can enjoy this freedom.

548
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,745
I'm surprised to know
that the president of Jeil News

549
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,788
was part of a pirate radio broadcast.

550
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,291
I have something to show you.

551
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,377
What could it be?

552
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,722
Hold on a second. Aren't those yours?

553
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:07,186
These are the tapes
of our pirate radio broadcasts.

554
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,024
I've cherished them for the past 20 years.

555
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,528
Do you see the dates?
This one is from 1980.

556
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,992
Do you see this magazine?

557
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,287
It must seem weird to young people,

558
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,874
but this is how
simple and innocent we were.

559
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,752
Did that pirate radio show create it?

560
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,253
Yes.

561
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,757
Well, we only published one issue.

562
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,427
The magazine is called Healer.
What does it mean?

563
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,639
Do you see this?

564
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,644
"The media is what diagnoses
and treats the illness of the society."

565
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,400
With that conviction,
I've protected the media.

566
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,573
I now want to devote myself
to the city of Seoul

567
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:07,663
for this nation's freedom,
democracy, and order

568
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,832
that we protected with our lives.

569
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,843
Are you okay?

570
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,598
I'm sorry.

571
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,852
What for?

572
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,812
I'm sorry.

573
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,237
Please don't cry.
You'll have another episode.

574
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,783
Is something wrong?

575
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,854
Those tapes...

576
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,357
Do you want me to get them back for you?

577
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,234
It won't be very hard.

578
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,819
You don't do that anymore.

579
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,030
You want an ordinary life.

580
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,449
So Yeong-sin told you.

581
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,577
Yes.

582
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,455
I wish you could live like that too.

583
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,416
That's for me to work on, but...

584
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,836
Are you okay?

585
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,423
You scared me.
I thought you were going to cry.

586
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,509
I almost did.

587
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,596
Because they stole your tapes?

588
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,766
Come over with some beer again.

589
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,185
I have so much to tell you.

590
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,229
With Yeong-sin too?

591
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,272
Yes.

592
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,536
My people are the best in the world.

593
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,205
I'll use this office for the time being.

594
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,290
Put in another desk here.

595
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,876
I'm sure you have another office to use.

596
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:20,754
What, me?

597
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,506
Instead of here?

598
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,174
Set up the room once the desks come in.

599
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,092
Yes, sir.

600
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,887
You must not know who I am.

601
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,099
Look here. I'm Bae Sang-su, the president.

602
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,686
It's called Double S Guard
after my initials.

603
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,398
And this is the president's office.

604
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,526
Yes?

605
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,364
People are walking out of Double S Guard.

606
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,075
They destroyed
all the security cameras nearby.

607
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,368
Take pictures and send them to me.

608
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,083
Don't forget the license plates.

609
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,508
-Should I follow them?
-No. Stand by.

610
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,136
But what are we doing here?

611
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,390
We're giving Healer
his retirement pension.

612
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,727
He sent pictures of the guys
who followed him

613
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,897
from Park Dong-cheol's place.

614
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:26,069
That means Park Dong-cheol's real killer
must be among them.

615
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,448
Why are they hanging out
with Sang-su's gang?

616
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,169
Where have I seen him before?

617
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,212
I know I have.

618
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,684
This is Someday News.
We're taking tips about Boss.

619
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,020
A take-out joint?

620
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,522
No, I don't know their number.

621
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:15,118
Seventy percent of the posts are fake,

622
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,163
and 20 percent of the posts are nonsense.

623
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,375
But we got more than expected.

624
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,960
We got a few on Seodo Bridge.

625
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:30,175
It touched a nerve
among its blue-collar employees.

626
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,679
Think about it.
A bridge they worked on collapsed.

627
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,224
What if it collapsed after it opened?

628
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,771
Sleep a little.
You look like you haven't slept.

629
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,233
It's about to begin.

630
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:51,071
I don't know how or from where.

631
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:51,988
Right.

632
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,034
But they only know how to do one thing.

633
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,745
They'll probably start by cutting us off.

634
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,832
It's a dirty move
that I hate responding to,

635
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,084
but it's very effective.

636
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,460
Damn.

637
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,929
This is bold of you two.

638
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,267
She can't sleep
if other people are around.

639
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,477
What about you?

640
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,562
I'm not "other people."

641
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,316
Look over here.

642
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,656
I hate leaving pictures of me behind.

643
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,201
I've liked taking pictures
ever since I could walk.

644
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,584
-But...
-Yes?

645
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,421
You want to take on that Boss guy, right?

646
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,173
That's right.

647
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,051
Will Yeong-sin be in danger again?

648
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:36,968
I'm not sure.

649
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,055
Do you want to take her far away?

650
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:44,017
If you do, it'll be easier
to live like ordinary people.

651
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,145
I'm hesitant.

652
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,397
Why?

653
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,943
I've been wondering why,

654
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,403
and I think it's because of you.

655
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:01,284
We can't leave you alone and go far away.

656
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,996
I'm touched.

657
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,166
But...

658
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,584
What?

659
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,545
I can't live without her anymore.

660
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,756
So if it's for her, I can abandon you.

661
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,633
That's fine.

662
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,156
Sorry, wrong number.

663
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,744
This is Someday News. Do you have a tip?

664
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,373
We need to record the call. Is that okay?

665
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:49,583
Sure.

666
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,005
Hold on.

667
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:58,675
Yes, go on.

668
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,094
Here's your mail.

669
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,562
SUBPOENA

670
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,479
Sir.

671
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,191
You have something
from the Prosecutor's Office.

672
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,323
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

673
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,866
SUBPOENA

674
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,827
SUBPOENA

675
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,289
This informant can introduce you
to the employees from back then.

676
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,082
Begin with making them feel safe.

677
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,125
Sure thing.

678
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:37,005
Wait. Who are you people?
Why are you here?

679
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,091
We're from the National Tax Service.

680
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,676
The National Tax Service?

681
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,678
What is it?

682
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,224
We received a tip that Someday News has
been funded through suspicious channels.

683
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,268
Who's Kim Mun-ho?

684
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,562
That's me.

685
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,148
If you agree, we'll begin our search.

686
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,859
If you refuse, we'll make it compulsory.

687
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,039
What? No, not that!

688
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,707
Wait!

689
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,422
I bought that with my own money!

690
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,757
These are our company documents.

691
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,258
I said these are ours!

692
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,218
Come on!

693
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,428
Seriously?

694
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,187
Damn.

695
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,530
-Sir...
-Yes?

696
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:47,325
-Is there something...
-No, it's nothing.

697
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,250
-Hey, Bong-su.
-Yes?

698
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,961
My wife runs a chicken place

699
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,256
and the city suddenly did
a sanitation check.

700
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,383
They found bacteria in the water filter

701
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,176
and shut down the place.

702
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:09,347
The fine is over 10 million won.

703
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:14,436
That couldn't be related
to what happened today, could it?

704
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,525
Never mind. Get back to work.

705
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,405
It couldn't be.

706
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:28,908
Shit.

707
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,053
What?

708
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,140
That car. It seems odd.

709
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:06,840
What is it?

710
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,139
Ms. Jo, can you track Kim Mun-ho's phone?

711
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,975
Shut up about me retiring!

712
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,105
I think he's been kidnapped.

713
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,442
What do you want to do?

714
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:29,279
Do you want to go with me
or wait at Mun-ho's place?

715
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,281
You'll probably get in a fight, right?

716
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,158
Probably.
