1
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,295
We were just passing by.

2
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,507
We saw the police cars rushing in,
so we came to see what happened.

3
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,549
I see.

4
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,386
Did you see anything, miss? You ran ahead.

5
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,809
She's never seen a crime scene before,
so she's shaken up pretty badly.

6
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,310
She works in entertainment news.

7
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,755
Yeong-sin.

8
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,424
Yeong-sin.

9
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,636
Let's go.

10
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,353
The person who fell down
must have died at the scene.

11
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,398
There must have been others there.

12
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,860
We should go.
Let's not stay here any longer.

13
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,322
There were others,
but I just didn't see them.

14
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,617
What are you thinking?

15
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,624
It's cold.

16
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,722
Yeong-sin.

17
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,891
Ji-an!

18
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,893
Ji-an,

19
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,061
are you okay?

20
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,558
Are you back?

21
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,312
Is he dead? Are you sure?

22
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,648
He apparently died at the scene.

23
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,568
So,

24
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,906
you didn't hear anything
before Park Dong-cheol died?

25
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,535
Does the tape
of your father's statement really exist?

26
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,621
He said it does.

27
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,289
Bastard.

28
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,376
If he were going to die anyway,
he should have told you.

29
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,543
But...

30
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,256
he said something strange as he was dying.

31
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,715
What?

32
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,347
Three. Nine. One.

33
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,140
What?

34
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:32,855
Three. Nine. One.

35
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,773
What?

36
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,608
Three, nine, one.

37
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,528
A number? Was it 391?

38
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,740
I don't know.

39
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,493
Is that all?

40
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,578
Yes, that's all.

41
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:49,998
And...

42
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,084
she was there.

43
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,380
She saw me.

44
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,230
Have a nice day.

45
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:22,196
I'll send some of the boys to get Bong-su.

46
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,868
I'll talk to him while
you talk to Yeong-sin.

47
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:31,456
She said she would tell me later
when the time is right. Damn it.

48
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,959
Later when?
After all the polar bears go extinct?

49
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:39,505
That's how kids are.
The more you press them,

50
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,050
the more they refuse to talk.
You'd know if--

51
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,348
Hello.

52
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,395
Chi-su, that's the guy
Yeong-sin always drools over...

53
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,399
Hello. What brings you by?

54
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,943
This is my father.

55
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,530
Dad, this is
the president of Someday News.

56
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,408
I'm Kim Mun-ho.

57
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,703
Hello, I'm Yeong-sin's father.

58
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,797
Haven't you told him yet?

59
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,590
Not yet.

60
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,800
Can't we tell him now?

61
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,843
I'd like to introduce myself properly.

62
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,639
What?

63
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,892
Introduce properly?
Is it what I'm thinking it is?

64
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,893
Dad.

65
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,230
Hold up. I need to gather my thoughts.

66
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,690
There's Bong-su,
but he wants to properly--

67
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,608
I...

68
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,486
found my biological mother.

69
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,246
She's alive but also very ill

70
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:59,544
which is why I can't tell her yet
that I'm her daughter.

71
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,756
Mun-ho is the one who found me.

72
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,717
I have been close to her parents
since I was young.

73
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,637
I was there the day she was born too.

74
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,853
My biological dad passed away
a long time ago.

75
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,023
And my name is

76
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,027
Oh Ji-an, Dad.

77
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,074
I just recently found out myself.

78
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,453
I knew I should've told you,

79
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:40,543
but I didn't know how to, so...

80
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

81
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,088
Three, nine, one. He meant 391.

82
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:31,177
Park Dong-cheol's hostel
didn't have a room 391.

83
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,971
What about a locker or storage unit?

84
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,227
You want me to search every locker
and storage unit with just 391 to go on?

85
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,439
Hey.

86
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,316
-Hello?
-What?

87
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,529
You keep spacing out.
Are you in your right mind?

88
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,113
Do I?

89
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,533
Are you thinking about Yeong-sin?

90
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,787
Do you think she suspects you?

91
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,289
Then just tell her

92
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,500
the details of what happened.

93
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,002
Call her.

94
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,255
I'll give you some space.

95
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,132
Okay, I'm out.

96
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,746
SEO JEONG-HU

97
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,836
What's up?

98
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,213
Hey, Bong-su.

99
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,758
SEO JEONG-HU

100
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,803
Jeong-hu.

101
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,790
SEO JEONG-HU

102
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,545
CONTACTS

103
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,963
HIM

104
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,256
HIM

105
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,177
It's probably best to hide
the name Seo Jeong-hu.

106
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,474
What else should I hide for you?

107
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,696
-What are you doing?
-I'm waiting for your call.

108
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,201
-Yeong-sin.
-You should at least call one more time.

109
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,995
Ask me anything.

110
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,414
Jeong-hu.

111
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,333
I'll answer everything.

112
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,961
Are you okay?

113
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,756
It wasn't you, right?

114
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,134
Who are you really?

115
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,345
If you don't ask,

116
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,306
I can't answer.

117
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,264
What the...

118
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,394
Shit.

119
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,523
Oh Tae-won was released this morning.

120
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,359
It's beyond my power.

121
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,155
We got a warrant
saying he's a flight risk,

122
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,867
but the people vouching for him
are of such high caliber.

123
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,328
He was acquitted
for insufficient evidence.

124
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,166
Did the detective who was arrested
say anything?

125
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,461
Park Ki-jung is exercising
his right to remain silent.

126
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,921
It won't be easy.

127
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,549
He knows how things work here.

128
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,927
So,

129
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,305
that being said,

130
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,099
I'd appreciate some more assistance.

131
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,898
There's a man
who went to Park Ki-jung's place,

132
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,817
gathered the evidence,
and gift-wrapped him for us.

133
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,864
Introduce him to me.

134
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,283
I bet you're ashamed to ask that.

135
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,955
Regardless, for the record,
I have no idea what you're talking about.

136
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,045
There was a murder last night
at St. Mary's Church.

137
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,882
I just got the case file,

138
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,219
and your name was listed as a witness.

139
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:28,224
I was just a bystander
since I didn't see anything.

140
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,937
But this case is strange.

141
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,689
There are so many witnesses.

142
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,902
The name of the deceased
is Park Dong-cheol,

143
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,031
and they say someone asked for him
just before he died.

144
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,701
A man in his 20s

145
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,787
with glasses and a hat worn low.

146
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,415
They say he even has
great fighting skills.

147
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,793
We didn't even ask,

148
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,630
but so many witnesses
keep coming forward to testify.

149
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,007
Do you have

150
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,387
any idea what may be going on?

151
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,062
Wow.

152
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,607
They turned the place upside down already.

153
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,151
That means

154
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,114
they are looking
for the recording as well.

155
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,117
What if they beat you to it?

156
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,410
Ms. Jo.

157
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,080
20 years is a very long time.

158
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:33,998
It is.

159
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,921
Would he have carried that tape around
not knowing who'd come looking for it?

160
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,634
It seems he moved from place to place.

161
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,599
I bet 500 won that the tape
isn't in this room.

162
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,687
I bet 5,000 won that he made it all up.

163
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,357
I bet a million won that the tape exists.

164
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,067
Do you have any leads?

165
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,574
It's strange. That recording is
of my father's statement.

166
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,159
What's on it is so obvious.

167
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:15,414
He either confessed to the murder
or denied the charges.

168
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,792
-But?
-But why are they making such a fuss?

169
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,797
Why do they care about what someone said
20 years ago before he died?

170
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,676
Look. Look at all this.

171
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,722
They even killed someone for it. Why?

172
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,192
It's soju, right?

173
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,527
What?

174
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,740
What you give a dead person?

175
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,534
You didn't

176
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,038
go there to look for the tape, did you?

177
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,414
This guy

178
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,542
died because of me.

179
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,796
Open the cap.

180
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,344
I opened it.

181
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,637
Sprinkle some around.

182
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,440
I did.

183
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,775
Drink a little.

184
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,284
Done.

185
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,786
Say anything you want to say.

186
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,667
I did.

187
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,920
Ask him what 391 is.

188
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,465
We hit a dead end because he died.

189
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,219
-If you hit a dead end--
-Don't do it.

190
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,431
You must climb over the wall.

191
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,892
That's how you reach the safe.

192
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,644
I said not to do it.

193
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,439
Hey, Jeong-hu. Hey!

194
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,229
Two are tailing me on foot,
and there's a vehicle too.

195
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,480
What should I do?

196
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,024
Should I grab one and ask who he is?

197
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,234
Or should I

198
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,654
keep the tail?

199
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,697
Ms. Jo.

200
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,079
Are you snacking?
Why aren't you answering me?

201
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,247
Jeong-hu

202
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,833
-Hold on.
-What?

203
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,836
Can you take a deep breath first?

204
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,296
Inhale and exhale.

205
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,506
What is it?

206
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,093
Oh Tae-won was released.

207
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,178
He was acquitted
due to insufficient evidence.

208
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,055
Also,

209
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,352
I planted a tracker
on Chae Yeong-sin's phone.

210
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,106
I think a stranger is accessing it.

211
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm not done yet.

212
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:17,322
I think she's headed
to Kim Mun-sik's house.

213
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,448
What?

214
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,993
And at that house is

215
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,245
Oh Tae-won.

216
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,455
Damn it.

217
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,195
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin?

218
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,918
Hello.

219
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,714
Are those flowers for me?

220
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,259
Right.

221
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,892
Thank you.

222
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,103
My pleasure.

223
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,024
You're very pretty.

224
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,616
You're much prettier in person too.

225
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,576
I'm a fan of yours.

226
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,415
Maybe it's because
I saw you on the broadcasts,

227
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,835
but I feel oddly close to you.

228
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,590
-I'm sorry.
-Ms. Chae?

229
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,594
I'm going through a lot right now.

230
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,807
Oh, my gosh. How embarrassing.

231
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,602
I'm sorry.

232
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,570
I cry easily.

233
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,780
Me too.

234
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,991
Really?

235
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,037
I'm so embarrassed.

236
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,933
This is Oh Tae-won.

237
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,270
I need to speak to Boss directly.

238
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,068
Mun-ho said there were five of you
running the pirate radio broadcast.

239
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,822
Ki Yeong-jae, whom we did a broadcast on,
was one of the five.

240
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,577
Come here.

241
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,338
Here are the five.

242
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,340
This is Yeong-jae.

243
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,133
I've seen this photo before.

244
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,095
Mr. Kim Mun-sik showed it to me.

245
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,680
-When?
-Not long ago.

246
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:18,021
This is you, and this is him.

247
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,023
And here.

248
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,442
This was my husband.

249
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:23,819
Oh Gil-han.

250
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,080
I heard he passed away.

251
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,042
Yes, in 1992.

252
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,129
May I...

253
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,632
ask you about it?

254
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,886
If I bring it up,

255
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,597
will that make you ill?

256
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,809
Mun-ho's very worried about you.

257
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,988
If I have an episode, press this button.

258
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,824
The nurse is in the next room.

259
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,413
-Then...
-Ask me.

260
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:26,923
From what I heard,
two out of the five friends passed away.

261
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,137
Do you know what happened?

262
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,058
Finally, after 20 years,

263
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,603
someone asks me

264
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,189
what happened that day.

265
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,613
From what I can tell,
that Chae Yeong-sin girl

266
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,407
is aware of her relationship
with Choi Myeong-hui.

267
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,577
I don't know when or how she'll expose it.

268
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,164
If Kim Mun-sik's wife finds out the truth,

269
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,541
she'll probably leave him.

270
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,421
That'll leave our man heartbroken.

271
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,346
If we had to find
another mayoral candidate,

272
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:19,184
it would make us look bad, wouldn't it?

273
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,977
What should I do?

274
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,439
If it's to protect
President Kim Mun-sik...

275
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,583
Hello, Boss.

276
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:51,174
You're the one who make this guy
and Kim Mun-sik do bad things, aren't you?

277
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,137
Boss.

278
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,476
I have something to ask you.

279
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,771
Where can I find you?

280
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,275
Get rid of this phone.

281
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,447
Jeez.

282
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,701
Talk about bad phone manners.

283
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,785
Damn it.

284
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,208
I'm offended,
so I'm confiscating this phone.

285
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,504
Mister.

286
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,340
You know me, right?

287
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,635
You came to get me once.

288
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,141
Do you remember my master too?

289
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,185
Ki Yeong-jae.

290
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,315
He was Healer.

291
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,819
You poisoned my master, didn't you?

292
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,447
You know my mom too, right?

293
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,034
I heard you threatened her recently.

294
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,286
I bet there's more.

295
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,622
If I keep you alive,
you'll keep doing this.

296
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,044
You'll kill people,

297
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,757
hurt people, and threaten them.

298
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,927
Even if you are arrested again,

299
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,888
you'll get out within days.

300
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,267
If I just

301
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,395
kill you,

302
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,607
I'd be doing the world a favor.

303
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,455
Can you tell our story?

304
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,919
When you say "our,"
do you mean the five friends?

305
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,629
I'll tell you everything I know

306
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,132
about what happened that day in 1992.

307
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,635
Okay.

308
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,972
I'd like you to do a broadcast
and report our story.

309
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,936
If Mun-ho permits it,
it won't be difficult.

310
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,897
But it will be dangerous.

311
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:16,194
Those people who killed us then
are still alive.

312
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,280
When you say "us"...

313
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,700
My husband, Oh Gil-han.
His friend, Seo Jun-seok.

314
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,079
My daughter, Oh Ji-an,

315
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,373
and me.

316
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,497
Thanks, Ms. Jo.

317
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,417
Of all I have done for you,
what are you thanking me for?

318
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,254
For stopping me
from killing someone like him.

319
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,924
I almost became a murderer
for killing this monster.

320
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,051
Hold on. You need to see this.

321
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,601
What do you think? Does it look like you?

322
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:34,522
I think they're determined to corner you
like hunters do to a rabbit.

323
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,334
THE LATE KI YEONG-JAE

324
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,251
Ms. Jo.

325
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:01,966
My dad is in a columbarium,
and I think each niche has a number

326
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,052
like an address.

327
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:12,185
I was at home
with my five-year-old daughter,

328
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,313
waiting for my husband
who went on an investigation.

329
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,191
Then I got a call.

330
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,401
It was Mun-sik.

331
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,409
Hello.

332
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,996
He told me to just run
that they were coming.

333
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,874
Ji-an, hurry up and get dressed.

334
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,339
-Ji-an, let's go.
-Where are we going?

335
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,008
-We need to go.
-Where are we going?

336
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,802
Where are we going?

337
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,555
Where are we going?

338
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,391
Where are we going?

339
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,076
This is my daughter, Ji-an.

340
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,079
I see.

341
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,581
Isn't she pretty?

342
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,132
Her mom is too.

343
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,428
They supposedly call themselves "farmers."

344
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,556
As in farmers that farm the land?

345
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,017
They think they're farming this nation.

346
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,228
They plant barley and corn

347
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,565
and pull out the weeds
that get in the way.

348
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,859
And when the time comes, they harvest.

349
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:47,864
They think that's how
they farm this nation.

350
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,785
Where are we going? Mom?

351
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,747
-Stop!
-Stop right there!

352
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,796
Mom, where are we going?

353
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,141
Ji-an, look at me and listen.

354
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,060
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

355
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,187
Don't make a sound, okay?

356
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,273
I'll be right back, so don't make a sound.

357
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,983
Don't say a word, okay?

358
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,402
Please, Ji-an.

359
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,955
Stop!

360
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:39,791
Stop right there!

361
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,175
My birth mom...

362
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,427
My biological mother...

363
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,682
I don't know what to call her,

364
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,685
but she had an episode.

365
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,022
She just fell asleep.

366
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,191
Right.

367
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,737
She told me many things
before it happened though.

368
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,409
She said she lost me.
She didn't abandon me.

369
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,955
I knew she wouldn't have.

370
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,585
She hid me,
but got hit by a car while running away.

371
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,631
She awoke in the hospital
a few days later.

372
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:40,096
She couldn't move,
so she couldn't look for me.

373
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,311
My biological mother...

374
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,940
The last thing she said to me was

375
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,736
not to say a word.

376
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,617
Maybe that's why I didn't talk
when I was young.

377
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,288
I was a good girl, wasn't I?

378
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,251
I thought I was abandoned.

379
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,794
She said you weren't.

380
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,424
I must have been scared.

381
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,510
If I didn't smile or

382
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,388
asked something people didn't like,

383
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,726
I thought they'd get sick of me

384
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,689
and want to abandon me.

385
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,482
Not

386
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,402
me.

387
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,615
Then,

388
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,534
may I ask you?

389
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,453
Of course.

390
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,414
-Jeong-hu.
-Yes?

391
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,334
Have you ever killed a person?

392
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,341
No.

393
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,427
I knew it.

394
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,443
There is something
I need to tell you though.

395
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,362
What?

396
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,656
I've become a murder suspect.

397
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,576
-Because of last night?
-Yes.

398
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,287
They even have a sketch.

399
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,792
-Does it look like you?
-Not at all.

400
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,962
Then what will you do? Will you run away?

401
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,090
I realized that it
doesn't resolve anything.

402
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,051
Then what should we do first?

403
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,845
First, I need to find my dad's tape.

404
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,056
I'll help.

405
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,725
I'll find the bastard who framed me.

406
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,686
I'll help with that too.

407
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,441
I need to go see your dad.

408
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,320
That's...

409
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,032
That's what scares me the most.

410
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,649
Do you know how many people

411
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,194
have gone missing in Korea
these past six years?

412
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,323
It's 30,000.

413
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,951
If they have been missing
for over five years,

414
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,038
the search for them stops.

415
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,583
To be blunt,

416
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,420
they are declared dead.

417
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,889
If someone famous
like Reporter Kim Mun-ho went missing,

418
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,433
do you think it'd be a big deal?

419
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,854
No, it won't even last two days.

420
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,440
People don't remember

421
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,943
other people's business for so long.

422
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,071
Mun-ho is my brother.

423
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,366
I'll talk to him.

424
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,618
I won't change

425
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,788
our mayoral candidate again.

426
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,416
It'll look bad.

427
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,086
I know, sir.

428
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,340
Our next plan is just about to begin.

429
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,842
There shouldn't be any errors.

430
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:51,931
If what happened 20 years ago
holds you back--

431
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,974
That won't happen.

432
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,644
I will take care of it.

433
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,167
Did Jeong-hu come by?

434
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,169
Chae Yeong-sin did as well.

435
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,048
Ms. Choi doesn't know
who she is yet though.

436
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:32,721
They talked for so long,
but I don't know what it was about.

437
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,640
It must be so hard for Myeong-hui.

438
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,102
Someone that fragile
ordered a wiretapping device

439
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,480
and called Mun-ho in secret.

440
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,569
To think she was so scared all night...

441
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,905
Will you just let her be?

442
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,199
You know what she's doing.

443
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,411
It's okay. She'll come back.

444
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,790
The thrill of a new game
just has her worked up.

445
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,879
I only wish she'd take
better care of herself.

446
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,349
You were right.

447
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,729
Your father's niche number is 391.

448
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,522
It's 391.

449
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,109
Then the tape of Jun-seok's statement
is in there.

450
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,903
We need to go take a look.

451
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,739
Are those rats still tailing you?

452
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,117
Yes, they are.

453
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,870
Yeong-sin, why don't you stay out of this?

454
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,706
You'll only slow Jeong-hu down.

455
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,458
That's not necessarily true.

456
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,126
Ms. Jo, you're the best.

457
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,214
I finished cleaning up Yeong-sin's phone.

458
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,051
What about the guys following me?

459
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,136
We need to find out who they work for.

460
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,972
You have been a wanted man for too long.

461
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,558
You're so experienced
that you're laid-back now.

462
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,395
What if they call the police on you?

463
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,023
That's right.

464
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,441
Yeong-sin.

465
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,861
If I'm about to be arrested,
pretend not to know me.

466
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,821
You may be mistaken for my accomplice.

467
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,782
Okay.

468
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,497
Damn it!

469
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:40,975
Yeong-sin.

470
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,768
Can you run?

471
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,478
I can run 100 meters in 17 seconds.

472
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,522
Of course, that was in high school.

473
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,779
What do you do if a fight breaks out?

474
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,324
Close my eyes and wait.
You will take care of it.

475
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,325
That's right.

476
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,119
And if you can, hide in a corner.

477
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,914
It's easier to shield yourself there
than in open space.

478
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,125
A corner if possible. Got it!

479
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,047
Wait. Don't make eye contact.

480
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,599
You can follow me,
but I'd appreciate some distance.

481
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,268
I need to work too, you know.

482
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,289
Yeong-sin.

483
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,875
-Run.
-Where to?

484
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,793
Straight ahead.

485
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,012
Picture.

486
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,347
Picture.

487
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,890
Watch your foot.

488
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,267
Picture.

489
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,978
Picture. Okay, watch your legs!

490
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,701
I know you. Hello.

491
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,294
-Seatbelt.
-Okay.

492
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,180
I told you, just drive.

493
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,351
But there are so many. Darn it.

494
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,106
These are new faces.

495
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,193
It will take time to figure out
who they work for.

496
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,153
Check the footage
of nearby security cameras.

497
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,489
I think he's headed somewhere.

498
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,074
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

499
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,131
-Hey, who is she?
-His girlfriend.

500
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,715
My vote is on girlfriend.

501
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,134
One more vote on girlfriend.

502
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,385
Who is she?

503
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:26,348
The head of department at ABS.
Ms. Kang Min-jae.

504
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,976
Then she's my rival.

505
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,603
She's my counterpart.

506
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:38,944
For sure,

507
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,156
she's his girlfriend.
No question about it.

508
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,285
Do you want some coffee?

509
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,957
I'm in charge of Kim Mun-sik's interview.

510
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,210
I hear you're preparing a counter-program.

511
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,503
That's right.

512
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,547
Will you discuss Omega Holdings?

513
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,216
That is Kim Mun-sik's money line.

514
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,803
You know better than anyone
that you can't touch Omega.

515
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,513
That was true at the station.

516
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,682
Your broadcast won't air.

517
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,727
We're prepared.

518
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:17,483
If you try to stop us,
we'll air that as well.

519
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:20,903
The more you try to stop us,
the more it helps us.

520
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,362
Nice, right?

521
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,242
I take back what I said before.

522
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,537
I said you fight just enough
not to get hurt.

523
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:32,956
Mun-ho,

524
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,250
that's the smart thing to do.

525
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,961
That way, you can fight for a long time.

526
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,089
Let's slow down.

527
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,467
Be in it for the long run.

528
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,014
I'm having fun these days.

529
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,934
It starts the moment I wake up.

530
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,644
In the past, I was like,

531
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:58,148
"Damn, here's another day
I need to get through."

532
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:04,238
These days, when I wake up,
I think about what I should do.

533
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,615
I wonder what the bad guys are doing.

534
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,952
What about you?

535
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:15,040
They are always above us.

536
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,459
How is that possible, you ask?

537
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,754
Because we live by the book,
but they don't.

538
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,050
You can't beat them.

539
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,927
But...

540
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,307
if I quit because I can't win,
I'd be ashamed in front of the workers.

541
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,476
I don't want that.

542
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,656
That's it. I think that's the car.

543
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:51,201
That car is suspicious too.
It's been following us.

544
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,620
It doesn't pass us
and just maintains a distance.

545
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,330
It's totally suspicious.

546
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,041
So suspicious.

547
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,336
What?

548
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,505
No, it's nothing.

549
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,389
Go straight ahead.

550
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,891
You'll arrive at the columbarium
in about ten minutes.

551
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,393
How are things over there?

552
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,711
May I help you?

553
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,139
For sure, she's his girlfriend.

554
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,851
This is so complicated.

555
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,456
Don't turn around.

556
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:07,462
I came here with Master

557
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,881
about eight or nine years ago.

558
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,509
Do you know what he said?

559
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:18,807
"Your dad isn't here anyway.

560
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,561
We don't know where he is.

561
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,731
But still,

562
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:30,110
you need to know
in which direction to greet him.

563
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,613
So let's just greet him here."

564
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,117
That's what he said.

565
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,847
THE LATE SEO JUN-SEOK

566
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:00,682
I found it.

567
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,272
This is my father.

568
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,732
THE LATE SEO JUN-SEOK

569
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,443
Father, this is Chae Yeong-sin.

570
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,072
You probably know her as Oh Ji-an.

571
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:20,994
Hello.

572
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,183
Miss?

573
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,605
Someday is doing its third broadcast.

574
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:52,651
What? Weren't we doing it
with Kim Mun-sik's interview?

575
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,903
We got new information
and it's been confirmed.

576
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,656
We need to release this information
as soon as possible.

577
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,242
Right now, before they can interfere.

578
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,578
-Right now?
-Now? A broadcast?

579
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,081
What about the information I prepared?

580
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,000
Publicize it using all venues possible.

581
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,253
Someday's third broadcast's title is this.

582
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:15,382
"Exposing the Puppet Master Controlling

583
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,801
the Puppet Kim Mun-sik."

584
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,472
I have prepared a video
and images of an interview.

585
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:26,059
We'll add on a little more
and begin the broadcast.

586
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,188
The important thing
is how many people will watch this.

587
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,023
What do you think?

588
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,067
The strife between the two brothers

589
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,361
is very popular.

590
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,737
People will tune in.

591
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,116
Power users of social media
are on standby too, right?

592
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,535
How much time do we need
for the broadcast?

593
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:47,247
I don't know how long
we'll be able to last.

594
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,261
THE LATE SEO JUN-SEOK

595
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:36,922
Will you be okay?

596
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,590
No problem.

597
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,383
Let's say our goodbyes and go.

598
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,438
THE LATE SEO JUN-SEOK

599
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,076
Close in and force them
somewhere with no cameras.

600
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,465
I called earlier.

601
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,219
Those people are leaving.
They went to the entrance.

602
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,137
I'm sure they're gangsters.

603
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:29,641
I heard them say
they have to abduct that woman.

604
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,031
Do we know each other?

605
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,075
Or do you have

606
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,661
something to say?

607
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:50,996
Hand it over.

608
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,374
If we hand it over, will you let us go?

609
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,625
I don't think so.

610
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,836
I guess that's not it either.

611
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,673
-Yeong-sin.
-Yes?

612
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:02,757
Close your eyes.

613
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,763
Run.

614
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,473
Hey!

615
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,892
Yeong-sin, throw it!

616
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,781
There was another lonely death.

617
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,701
Mr. Park Dong-cheol.

618
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,871
He was a detective
burning with a sense of duty.

619
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,250
One day in 1992, he heard the statement of

620
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,961
a murder suspect in an interrogation room.

621
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,759
Do you remember Ki Yeong-jae,
the subject of Someday's second broadcast?

622
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,221
He and Seo Jun-seok,
who was in the interrogation room in 1992,

623
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:52,390
were part of the same
pirate radio broadcast.

624
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:58,938
And like Ki Yeong-jae, Seo Jun-seok
also died in the interrogation room.

625
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,461
Give me the tape.

626
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:25,215
Fine, I'll give it to you.
Just don't punch me again.

627
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,940
You two, move!

628
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,569
I'm bleeding!

629
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:51,324
How could you? Wait, wait!

630
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,952
Let me meet Boss.

631
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:59,040
Tell him I'll give him the tape

632
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,210
and the LA video files as well.

633
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,881
Call him. He'll respond for sure.

634
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,343
Also, tell him this too.

635
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,848
"Healer would like to side with Boss."

636
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,892
I know Boss wants to meet me.

637
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,521
Gosh, that was some punch.

638
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,898
It really hurts.

639
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,652
Newspapers printed
a short article about it.

640
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,407
They said Seo Jun-seok committed suicide
because he was overcome with guilt

641
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,659
after killing his friend.

642
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,621
Oddly enough, the stories of two friends

643
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,498
are very much alike
despite the 22 years of gap.

644
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,709
Both deaths were caused by poison.

645
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,754
One was suicide, one was murder.

646
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,718
But Park Dong-cheol,
who had questioned Mr. Seo

647
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,136
said something entirely different.

648
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:58,975
The statement we received was different
from the one that was submitted.

649
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,146
It was a complete work of fiction.

650
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,608
So what did we do?

651
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,527
We reported it to Internal Affairs.

652
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,696
What do you think happened to us next?

653
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,698
I heard you were kicked out.

654
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,811
Park Dong-cheol was kicked out
for blowing the whistle on the matter,

655
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,440
but he kept an audio tape
for the past 22 years.

656
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,902
It was of Seo Jun-seok's statement.

657
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:56,407
I suspect Park Dong-cheol
was killed by the people

658
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,576
trying to destroy that tape.

659
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:04,499
Because the 22-year-old tape
that he gave us just before he died

660
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,002
had some incredible stories about them.

661
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:15,593
MARCH 2, 1992, TESTIMONY OF SEO JUN-SEOK

662
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,480
What a nice house.

663
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:38,575
Who are these people he referred to?

664
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,495
SOMEDAY NEWS

665
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,313
He's coming.

666
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:18,573
A reporter from Someday News
went somewhere to ask just who they are.

667
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:23,036
This person is only referred to as Boss.

668
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:41,888
Hello.

669
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,757
Where have I seen him before?

670
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,384
I know I have.

671
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,344
I listened to your dad's statement.

672
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:22,595
Jeong-hu.

673
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,097
This is plenty.

674
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,139
Come back.

675
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,641
Let's proceed as planned.

676
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,351
Let's go all the way.

677
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,937
Kid, who are you really?

678
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,231
When you kill people from now on,

679
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,818
think about their sons and daughters.

680
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,945
Make a right at the intersection.

681
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:42,740
Is it hard to just live
like ordinary people?

682
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,410
Will it be hard for me?
