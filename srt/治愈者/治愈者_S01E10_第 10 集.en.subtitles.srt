1
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,133
Okay! Listen up.

2
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,511
Kim Ui-chan will hold
a press conference at 4 p.m.

3
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,138
announcing his candidacy for mayor.

4
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,390
Simultaneously, Someday
will premier "Someday News"

5
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,100
an online news program.

6
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,312
They're only letting in reporters
on the list.

7
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,647
Newspapers and stations not on the list

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,193
can't even go into the room,
let alone ask questions.

9
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:12,238
A business card from Someday
or Monday won't cut it.

10
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,408
The son of DK's CEO Kim Se-gwang is

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,369
having his engagement party
in the next room.

12
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,371
Do you know them?

13
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,625
They can't stop their guests that easily.

14
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,585
Excuse me?

15
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,672
Go undercover? Us?

16
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,509
KIM UI-CHAN ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR MAYOR

17
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,229
Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan
will arrive secretly

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,316
to avoid unnecessary questions
while walking in.

19
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,695
Only reporters on the list will be

20
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,489
permitted into the press conference.

21
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,825
And the questions
will be asked in the order

22
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,202
and about the topics specified.

23
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,705
So there should not be
any unforeseen events.

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,542
They are worried about questions
about that woman

25
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,753
who reported Assemblyman Kim
for sexual bribes.

26
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,297
We can't let anything related to that air.

27
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,757
Got it?

28
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,800
I know.

29
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,718
We're airing a live exclusive broadcast.

30
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,762
We must be extra careful

31
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,890
so that they don't blame us for anything.

32
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,308
Okay, I understand.

33
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,979
He just arrived.

34
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,701
I think we have enough photos.

35
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,078
-Will you really be okay?
-About what?

36
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,289
You have a strong image
as this generation's

37
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,708
spearhead for the truth and morals.

38
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,210
If you publicize yourself
like some celebrity,

39
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,670
you may tarnish your image.

40
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,673
A friend of mine called me
a popularity addict.

41
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,217
If I really am popular,

42
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,428
-put me up for sale.
-For sale?

43
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,722
"Kim Mun-ho left the shackles
of regulated TV

44
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,640
and started his own news program.

45
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,560
Let's see how ridiculous it can be."

46
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,854
I understand.

47
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,523
We entertainment reporters
have solid connections.

48
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,734
The most the higher ups
are involved is about

49
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,652
how sexy the headline is.

50
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,364
Leave it to us. We'll get it done.

51
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,490
Thank you.

52
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,414
I am sorry, but you are not on the list.

53
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,958
-Please check again.
-It is not here. Sorry. Next.

54
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,753
-No, you can't go in. Next.
-Please.

55
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:56,986
Excuse me.

56
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,864
Excuse me. This area is restricted.

57
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,745
Who is restricting me and why?

58
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,751
We're here to attend

59
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,419
the engagement party at the Crystal Room.

60
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,963
We're the groom's cousins.

61
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,007
The engagement party. I see.

62
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,848
Gosh. Honey,

63
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,978
I'm about to be in a bad mood.
Do something.

64
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,062
Okay.

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,440
Who should we call?

66
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,528
Assistant Kim? Or Assistant Park?

67
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,239
Tell the president of the hotel
to come himself

68
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,740
before I blow up.

69
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,867
If people like us blow up,

70
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,911
it'll be all over the news.

71
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,830
-So before I do...
-Please excuse us.

72
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,040
The Crystal Room is that way.

73
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,627
You may go in.

74
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,923
It's so narrow.

75
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,677
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,277
-Hurry. Come here.
-I can't go in there.

77
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,487
How can I go into the men's room?

78
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,573
Oh my gosh. What are you...

79
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,491
What are you doing?

80
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,678
Yes, Mr. Kim.

81
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,015
We're ready. We just need to go in now.

82
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,685
You must do whatever it takes
to ask your questions.

83
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,520
You don't need a response.

84
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,898
Ask as many as possible
and we'll air it live.

85
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,649
We'll do the rest from here.

86
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,776
Okay.

87
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,445
I can ask questions.
That much I can and will do.

88
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,623
Why do you keep calling? I'm busy.

89
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,084
Why are you busy? What are you doing?

90
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,543
I'm a reporter, remember?

91
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,089
Why exactly are you doing this though?

92
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,426
I need to film someone's press conference.

93
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,344
Who?

94
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,263
I heard the name but I don't remember.

95
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,891
There must be dozens of cameras there.

96
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,476
If you hang around there--

97
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,771
I'm a master at evading cameras.
Don't worry.

98
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,398
-I'm busy. Bye.
-The police are on her.

99
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,777
Dae-yong sent me some pictures,

100
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,822
and they are checking everyone
near Chae Yeong-sin.

101
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,573
You've been photographed already.

102
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,743
A master at evading cameras did you say?

103
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,959
Would they run a background check
on Park Bong-su?

104
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,837
They're Yoon Dong-won's guys.

105
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,217
We should think about why they're on her.

106
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,886
I have a bad feeling about this.

107
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,930
Just get out of there right now.

108
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,807
I can't.

109
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,016
Why not?

110
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,727
I got

111
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,729
a job request.

112
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,441
Without my knowledge? From whom?

113
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,864
From me. To stay with Chae Yeong-sin.

114
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,741
I'm busy. Bye.

115
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,204
What are you doing? Let's go.

116
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,594
Detective Jo? I'm busy.

117
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,722
Both the old and the young one
are getting on my nerves.

118
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,140
What now?

119
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,642
Your apprentice has finally lost it.

120
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,852
What will you do about it?

121
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,027
PERSONNEL FILE
PARK BONG-SU

122
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,577
I want to cross-check every person here.

123
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,873
See if their addresses
and history match up.

124
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,166
I almost forgot.

125
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,710
The face. That's important.

126
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,754
Check the photos and see

127
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,882
if their faces are
on their respective files.

128
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,551
Check their driver's licenses
and things like that.

129
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,887
-Yes..
-Thanks.

130
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,680
PERSONNEL FILE

131
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,156
Come in.

132
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,992
It's about to start.

133
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,705
Let's watch together. We can talk after.

134
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,420
COMING UP NEXT:
KIM UI-CHAN ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR MAYOR

135
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,047
We will begin now.

136
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,841
Ready, cue.

137
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,266
Insert text on my cue. Now.

138
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:23,771
KIM UI-CHAN ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR MAYOR

139
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,655
First, Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan will

140
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,783
announce his position
with respect to his candidacy.

141
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,120
My beloved citizens of Seoul,

142
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,875
thank you for enduring these
difficult times.

143
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,211
I feel your pain.

144
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:53,175
I stand before you today
in order to help alleviate

145
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,763
your exhaustion, even if only slightly.

146
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,809
Seoul is the center of Korea.

147
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,896
If Seoul is weakened, Korea is weakened.

148
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:11,277
If Seoul is steadfast, Korea is steadfast.

149
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,870
I'm Reporter Yoo Jae-seok
of Gyeongdong News.

150
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,291
Your pledge of a safe Seoul
is very exciting.

151
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,917
Could you elaborate?

152
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,670
Welfare, city development and

153
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,756
job creation are all important.

154
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,216
But there is a more important problem

155
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,260
that everyone is missing.

156
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,097
It is the health issues
of the people of Seoul.

157
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,641
KIM UI-CHAN ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR MAYOR

158
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,351
Beneath our feet

159
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,228
flows something
that puts our health at risk.

160
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,772
It is the water.

161
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,027
Do you think the water we drink is safe?

162
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,071
It is not.

163
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,909
Then why does no one bring it up?

164
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,245
It's because they can't
resolve it during their term...

165
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,207
I can't talk now. I'll call you back.

166
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,709
No, I need to talk to you now.
It won't take long.

167
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,463
-What is it?
-I thought I should quietly

168
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,966
tell you first before anyone else.

169
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,181
Tell me. What is it?

170
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,891
I'd like to let you know that

171
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:28,771
I, Kim Ui-chan, have a vision and a plan

172
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,400
to improve the quality of our water.

173
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,361
Next question please.

174
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,958
You must grab the opportunity to

175
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,919
ask Kim Ui-chan directly
about Hwang Je-guk

176
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,462
and Joo Yeon-hui

177
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,298
in front of countless cameras
and microphones.

178
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,092
Can you do it?

179
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,400
Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan,
you know Joo Yeon-hui, correct?

180
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,412
I'm Reporter Park Seong-sik of Juhan News.

181
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,207
You said you would not do
a smear campaign.

182
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,084
So what is your campaign strategy?

183
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,586
Throw your shoe or something.

184
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,754
You need to grab my attention.

185
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,007
That's the only way
to continue the interview.

186
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,845
Yes, well, my campaign

187
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,889
strategy is...

188
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,693
I heard Hwang Je-guk
of Je-guk Construction

189
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,820
introduced her to you.

190
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,072
What did he want in return?

191
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,157
Who is this girl?

192
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,828
You were on the Strategy
and Finance Committee when

193
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,206
Je-guk Construction won
the sewage construction bid.

194
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,375
Soon after, you bought
an apartment in Seocho-gu

195
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,419
which is the apartment where you

196
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,255
secretly had rendezvous with Joo Yeon-hui.

197
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,259
-What?
-I wanted to say sorry.

198
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,304
I wish you weren't the one
managing the broadcast van.

199
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,056
Why did it have to be you?

200
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,309
We needed just 30 seconds,

201
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,479
so I had to drag you out of there.

202
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,606
I'm sorry, Min-jae.

203
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,027
Someday's Reporter Kim Mun-ho will

204
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,987
continue broadcasting this story.

205
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,114
Who is Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan's woman?

206
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,825
What is his relationship
with Je-guk Construction?

207
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,246
If you run a search
on Someday News, Kim Mun-ho...

208
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,832
How do you do?

209
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,376
KIM UI-CHAN ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR MAYOR

210
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,627
-Hello.
-I'm Kim Ui-chan.

211
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,103
Did she say "Someday News"?

212
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,650
-Please excuse me while I make a call.
-To whom?

213
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,569
I'll have to initiate precautions

214
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,321
and contain the newspapers, TV
and other reporters.

215
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,031
-And...
-Did you hear that?

216
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,493
Proceed.

217
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:39,003
That girl in the red dress...

218
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,337
I will take care of it.

219
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,423
Take care of it? How?

220
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,550
A reporter asked a question
at a press conference.

221
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,218
How is that a crime?

222
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,596
It is a crime. I'll make it one.

223
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,014
It has already

224
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,226
been aired live across the nation

225
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,105
by an attractive and feisty reporter.

226
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,275
If we take any action against her,

227
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,570
that itself will make the headlines.

228
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,578
Kim Mun-ho just sent us
a legitimate warning.

229
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,289
He's warning us

230
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,125
to not touch her.

231
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,505
We at Someday News obtained videos of

232
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,633
Hwang Je-guk providing sexual bribes.

233
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,302
This was submitted secretly to Someday

234
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,388
by an anonymous source.

235
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,768
These videos show 14 men
receiving the services.

236
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,939
Among them is Assemblyman K, who announced

237
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,024
his candidacy for mayor of Seoul today.

238
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,652
We tried to confirm it with him,
but as you saw,

239
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,445
we did not get a response.

240
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,864
We asked the woman in question

241
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,033
what she was told when she was

242
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,118
first introduced to Assemblyman K.

243
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,503
What did he say about Assemblyman K?

244
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,922
Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan?

245
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,256
Yes.

246
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,468
That he was going to be
the next mayor of Seoul.

247
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:14,598
That he may end up being
the future president of Korea.

248
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,732
We've taken care of
the politics and news groups,

249
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,025
but...

250
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,193
But?

251
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,154
It's spreading through
an unexpected route.

252
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,032
Each company's entertainment segment is

253
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,201
posting it as their main story, along with

254
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,203
Reporter Kim Mun-ho's picture.

255
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,331
And all at the same time,
as if they were waiting.

256
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,382
That Reporter Kim Mun-ho sure is talented.

257
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,097
I'll look for a way.

258
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,515
Mr. Kim.

259
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,642
Yes, sir.

260
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,645
I think we'll have to discard Kim Ui-chan.

261
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,357
We can still bury this, so...

262
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,567
How would you like

263
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
to take his spot?

264
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,206
We, Someday News,
are unable to broadcast every day.

265
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,709
We may broadcast once a week or

266
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,462
it may be longer
before we can broadcast again.

267
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,548
However, even if we only have one chance,

268
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,633
we won't broadcast something

269
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:37,056
that sticks to the powerful
and blinds the weak.

270
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,640
We'll see you again when something

271
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,476
must be given a voice.

272
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,438
This concludes Someday News'
first broadcast.

273
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,149
Thank you for watching.

274
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,968
ASSEMBLYMAN K, SOMEDAY NEWS

275
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,638
KIM MUN-HO

276
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,641
KIM MUN-HO

277
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,437
KIM MUN-HO INITIATED
HIS FIRST INTERNET LIVE BROADCAST

278
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,648
TOP SEARCHED KEYWORD: KIM MUN-HO

279
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:49,211
What did I just do?

280
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,422
What's gotten into me?

281
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,900
Thank you, everyone.

282
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,575
Our server is about to explode
from the traffic.

283
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,828
They are all trying to watch it again
or download it.

284
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,873
Let it explode. Let it blow up.

285
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,877
Jeez, I almost wet my pants earlier.

286
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,756
-It's over, right?
-Over? This is the beginning.

287
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,717
We're all dead now.

288
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,678
Will we still get paid?

289
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,732
Get paid? Did you hear this brat?

290
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:56,320
You idiot. How can you
bring up money right now?

291
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,374
Mr. Kim.

292
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,217
I guess that's Mun-ho.

293
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,636
Is he a senior reporter whom she respects

294
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,512
and she a junior reporter
he needs to train?

295
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,849
Or is their relationship more personal?

296
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,976
Which do you think it is?

297
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,021
If it's the latter, I'll give up now.

298
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,317
But if it's the former,
I'm thinking of making a move.

299
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,909
Jeez.

300
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,389
No, I only did what you told me to.

301
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:10,519
But didn't I do much better than expected?

302
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,021
I surprised myself too, actually.

303
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,899
I didn't know I had it in me.

304
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:20,487
You know, I'm usually quiet and reserved.

305
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,283
Good job. You exceeded my expectations.

306
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,161
Wow. I just got a compliment.

307
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,414
Things will get tough from now on.

308
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,792
You'll face and fight things
you've never imagined.

309
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,962
I'm ready for it if you'll guide the way.

310
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,965
Okay. Get some rest for today.
Jong-su is there, right?

311
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,468
I'll tell him to drive you home.

312
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,014
No, people will complain it's sexism.

313
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,432
Do as I say.

314
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,435
Yes, sir.

315
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,894
-Okay.
-Oh, and...

316
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,229
Yes?

317
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,398
You...

318
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,776
You're a better person than I thought.

319
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,612
I guess I had the wrong idea about you.

320
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,573
Thank you.

321
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,534
Sure.

322
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,171
Thank you, Ji-an.

323
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:57,542
You're growing more and more perceptive.

324
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,588
It's as if that's your
newly developed super power.

325
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,839
How adorable.

326
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:16,895
There is one thing
I don't like about Mun-ho.

327
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,940
He doesn't know the joy of team dinners.

328
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,025
People working for a company like us...

329
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,736
When we accomplish something
like we did today...

330
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,447
Damn it.

331
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,534
When we are frustrated or feeling icky,

332
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,994
we should go out to eat and party.

333
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,540
-What is it?
-See that alley up ahead? Go there.

334
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,470
What? Where did they go?

335
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,807
Turn around. Make a U-turn.

336
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,646
Stop!

337
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,400
-What's going on?
-Hold on.

338
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,651
Yeong-sin, hurry. Hurry!

339
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,611
-Why?
-What? What's going on?

340
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,030
-Just go for now. Go! Hurry!
-Why? Okay.

341
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,574
-What is it?
-In here.

342
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,875
What is it? Where are we going?

343
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,297
Well... Yeong-sin.

344
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,049
-Spit it out.
-Let's...

345
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,510
party.

346
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,887
What?

347
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,723
Just the two of us.

348
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,517
-Do you want to drink?
-Yes.

349
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,227
-Just the two of us?
-Yes.

350
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,690
Being with Jong-su
is a bit uncomfortable, right?

351
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,858
Right.

352
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:49,446
Since we're dressed like this,
should we get some wine?

353
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,909
Sure, let's live it up tonight. Let's go.

354
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,912
Wait a minute.

355
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,456
Can we go somewhere I know?

356
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,166
You know of a place?

357
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,253
-But there is no wine.
-Then what? Soju?

358
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,216
This way.

359
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,932
Young man.

360
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,560
What was your name again?

361
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,024
If you just glare at the world like that,

362
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,820
you'll only make your eyes water.

363
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,615
Close your eyes

364
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,909
just once.

365
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,786
Then open them again.

366
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:24,291
You'll see things you didn't see before.

367
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,837
That is called maturing.

368
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,672
Deceiving the world,

369
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,591
making false testimonies,

370
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,177
and betraying friends

371
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,890
is "maturing"?

372
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,267
Exactly.

373
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,978
That's how you survive.

374
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,983
And the woman you care so much about...

375
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,611
Well, you'll help her live too.

376
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:59,034
You need to get her
the best medical treatment

377
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,245
at the best medical facilities
to save her.

378
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,123
Then you can do whatever you want

379
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,376
whether it's atonement or love.

380
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,213
Realizing that is

381
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,716
what they call "maturing."

382
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,762
So,

383
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,558
what was your name again?

384
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,003
-Why are you alone?
-I want to know too. Why am I alone?

385
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,713
It's not like I'm an outcast.

386
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,340
What is this?

387
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,759
Reporters Chae and Park's
change of clothes.

388
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,054
Those people left me and took off.

389
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,182
Am I an outcast?

390
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,393
We're having a company party. Let's go.

391
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,144
A company party?

392
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,314
Yes, Mun-ho...
Wait, what should I call him?

393
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,024
Mr. President? Reporter Kim?

394
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,416
Bars are better

395
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,961
on lower levels like the basement
than on higher floors.

396
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,129
So why don't we--

397
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,255
I...

398
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,382
So I...

399
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,427
I like high places.

400
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:46,182
Let's just say I like watching people
from high up.

401
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,561
There are only a few places
like this in Seoul.

402
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,980
I share them with the security guards.

403
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,233
Sometimes, they get torn down.

404
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,361
It's like my secret spot.

405
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,449
You like watching people from high up?

406
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,243
I can see them,

407
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,496
but they can't see me.

408
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,541
A secret spot?

409
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,626
Yes, a secret spot.

410
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,558
This way.

411
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,617
What is it? Don't you have the key?

412
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,079
Well...

413
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:17,208
My key is in my jacket
that I was wearing earlier.

414
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,356
Tell anyone about this and you're dead.

415
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,677
Wow.

416
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,491
The first time I went to your house,

417
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:36,371
your father gave me a few warnings.

418
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,374
My dad? What did he say?

419
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,377
First, don't let you drink.

420
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,421
If you begin talking about dinosaurs,

421
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,049
he said I should be alarmed.

422
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,678
Nonsense. That was so long ago.

423
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,222
I haven't talked about dinosaurs in ages.

424
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,558
And I can really hold my alcohol now,

425
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,060
so that won't happen. Give it to me.

426
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,228
Second,

427
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,523
don't let you open cans.

428
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,484
One out of three times, you cut yourself.

429
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,736
What? That rarely happens.

430
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,824
I cut myself once in a while.
He's overreacting.

431
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,543
Hey.

432
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,100
It's nice here.

433
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,395
I'm glad.

434
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,442
It isn't snowing.

435
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,405
Right.

436
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,492
It isn't snowing today.

437
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,412
Park Bong-su.

438
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,538
Yes?

439
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:04,125
Tell me about yourself today.
You always listen to me.

440
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,419
So today, I'll listen to you.

441
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,800
Talk about life or relationships.

442
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,472
I'm a pretty good listener, you know.

443
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,057
Has he come yet?

444
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,812
The person you're waiting for.

445
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,442
Hey, that's about me, not you.

446
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,194
Talk about yourself today.

447
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,114
-About me?
-Yes.

448
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,454
What about me?

449
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,165
What?

450
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,796
Rather than waiting for someone
who isn't coming,

451
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,256
how about you consider me?

452
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,306
You're awful at telling jokes.

453
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,642
It's more confusing than funny.

454
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,935
If you want,

455
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,730
I can live as the person you want me to.

456
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,944
For as long as possible
while being very careful,

457
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,280
I can be here for you.

458
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,706
Are you saying you like me?

459
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,416
Yes.

460
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,712
Do you mean it?

461
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,881
Yes.

462
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,888
Wait.

463
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,351
Think about it before you answer.

464
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,481
There is nothing to think about because

465
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,234
I can't do it right now.

466
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:59,407
There's no room for you here
at the moment.

467
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,950
Is it because of him?

468
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,704
Yes, it's because of him.

469
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,624
I'm sorry.

470
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,340
Is that so?

471
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,678
Is that it?

472
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,557
Yes. I give up. It's over.

473
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,857
Jeez, you had me petrified there.

474
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,405
But you know...

475
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,825
Yes, Yeong-sin?

476
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,411
You were really strange just now.

477
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,414
You seemed

478
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,834
like a different person.

479
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,795
Of course I was.

480
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,300
I told a girl I liked her
for the first time ever,

481
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,427
and was rejected in three seconds.

482
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,805
Don't be too hurt.

483
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,308
I'll try not to be.

484
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,729
You just have strong competition.

485
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,024
Please stop.

486
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:19,445
Do you enjoy rubbing salt
in my wound like that?

487
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,949
Sorry.

488
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,006
Hey, Bong-su.

489
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,384
What?

490
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,722
When did you start liking me?

491
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,808
From the moment you first saw me?

492
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,185
Was it the fabled love at first sight?

493
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,561
Please stop talking.

497
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,516
-Are you done?
-I got all the photos.

498
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,642
Let's take a look.

499
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,562
Hold on.

500
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,607
Hello? Yoon Dong-won speaking.

501
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,987
Hwang Je-guk?
Yes, I was there earlier today.

502
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,575
He's dead?

503
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,912
A suicide?

504
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:16,228
No one came in after
Detective Yoon Dong-won left.

505
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,982
He was alone the entire time
behind locked doors.

506
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,693
He didn't come out to eat
or answer any calls.

507
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,779
We were worried
so we broke the lock, and...

508
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,326
I AM SORRY FOR EVERYTHING I DID

509
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,681
-Don't you want to see this?
-Email them to me.

510
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,811
Detective Cha? It's Yoon Dong-won.

511
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,161
Hi.

512
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,623
I insisted it wasn't suicide,

513
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,708
so we began investigating the scene.

514
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,502
Did you find anything?

515
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,672
Yes, we found too much.

516
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,216
It's like a treasure island.

517
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,095
Firstly, here. His suicide note.

518
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,308
He apologized for
all the wrong he had done,

519
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,521
and so nicely listed
every wrongdoing he did.

520
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,109
It says he wronged those poor ladies and

521
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,735
he even killed someone.

522
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,489
Killed someone, as in Ko Seong-cheol?

523
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,910
He was on a train to Busan one day.

524
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,912
The guy next to him was so annoying

525
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,789
that he slipped the guy something,

526
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,915
but it killed him.

527
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,586
He was haunted by that
every night since then,

528
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,756
so he took

529
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,009
that same drug himself.

530
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,013
He was also generous enough

531
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,224
to provide us with the train ticket.

532
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,146
I've never met anyone so helpful and nice.

533
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,981
What do you think?

534
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,559
MIBONG HIGH SCHOOL

535
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,565
Seo Jeong-hu?

536
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,319
I'm Ki Yeong-jae, a friend of your dad.

537
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,862
Come with me.

538
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,907
Where do you plan to go?

539
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,910
While you were in juvenile detention,

540
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,329
your grandmother passed away.

541
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:24,041
And you can't go to your mom
who remarried.

542
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,794
She's very happy with her new family.

543
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,754
If you go there, you'll ruin it.

544
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,260
You have nowhere to go.

545
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,846
I sold your grandmother's house.

546
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,561
I used the money for her funeral and

547
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,688
-the rest...
-Give it to me.

548
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,357
-Now?
-My money.

549
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,067
Give it to me.

550
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,777
No.

551
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,323
Give it to me.

552
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,618
Give it to me.

553
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,418
You thief! Give my money back!

554
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,006
It's in here, so why don't you take it?

555
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,693
Take it whenever you want,

556
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,070
but I won't give it to you nicely.

557
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,157
Take it from me, or steal it.

558
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,994
But you have a lot to learn before you can

559
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,413
take this from me.

560
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,962
Which one?

561
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,130
Hey, old geezer.

562
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,050
Bring the kimchi. The noodles are ready.

563
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,427
-Which one?
-Jeez.

564
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,389
This one.

565
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,143
Right? The South Pacific is the best.

566
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,398
That looks good.

567
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,827
What is that? Are you going somewhere?

568
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,246
To the South Pacific.

569
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,791
To paradise, where I can see bikinis
all year round.

570
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,211
When are you coming back?

571
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,921
I'm not.

572
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,339
Right.

573
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,968
Here, take it. It's yours.

574
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,303
There's a phone number.
That'll be your income source.

575
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:32,558
If you call,
an ill-tempered woman will answer.

576
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,935
Make sure you do a good job.

577
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,228
Master, please.

578
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,273
You became an adult today.

579
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,484
You can live alone now.

580
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,655
What?

581
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,490
Wait. Hold on a second.

582
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:53,328
Still... I cooked enough noodles for two.

583
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,372
Eat it all.

584
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,376
Wait. But... Master!

585
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,877
Master!

586
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,879
You'll be right back, won't you?

587
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,340
You're pulling my leg, right?

588
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,010
Master, wait! Master!

589
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,761
It's my birthday today!

590
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,180
Master!

591
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,960
-You said you'd never come back.
-Did I?

592
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,046
-Why did you return?
-Well,

593
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,673
two women were fighting over me.

594
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,551
I didn't know women could be so vicious.

595
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,011
You never called.

596
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,930
Not even once.

597
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,979
Did you not want to? Or...

598
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,150
did you forget about me completely?

599
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,278
I have a stone in my stomach

600
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,156
about this big, do you know that?

601
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,284
But whenever I see you,
it twists around and hurts me.

602
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,083
Why are so many people in pain
when they see me?

603
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,752
Detective Jo called
at all hours of the day.

604
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,838
She always called
whenever I had a girl in bed.

605
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,684
She told me that

606
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:43,397
you wanted to know about this photo.

607
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,983
I told you everything,
so what else do you want to know?

608
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,822
Ask me. I came to answer your questions.

609
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,740
Why did my dad

610
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,412
kill himself?

611
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,293
-You knew?
-Yes.

612
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:06,795
Since when?

613
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,757
Since I was very little.

614
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:16,138
There were many tactless adults around me
who weren't discreet.

615
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,681
So why are you asking now?

616
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,058
I went to see my mom to ask her.

617
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,269
I checked countless community centers and

618
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,521
missed a week of school to find her,

619
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,524
and I did.

620
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,655
But I couldn't get myself to ask

621
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,825
because as soon as she saw me,

622
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,910
my mom began to weep.

623
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,415
So, I decided to leave it.

624
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,293
"Dad died in

625
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,755
a car accident."

626
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,759
Here. Look.

627
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,845
"Look how happy he seems with his friends.

628
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,849
Someone this happy and well
would not have taken his life."

629
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,727
I loved this picture
because it made me think that.

630
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,480
I'm glad. Keep thinking that.

631
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,983
I did, until I saw this picture
in that jerk's house.

632
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:16,323
The bastard who tried
to frame me for murder.

633
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,449
Here.

634
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,744
It was in the house of this bastard

635
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,121
and this woman.

636
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,206
Jeong-hu.

637
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,250
So why

638
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,586
did my dad

639
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,215
commit suicide?

640
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,800
He had me

641
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,220
and my mom, so why?

642
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,639
Knowing why won't change anything.

643
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,392
I think I could

644
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,355
find the reason then.

645
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,190
-The reason?
-Master,

646
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,318
I have

647
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,323
no reason to live.

648
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:01,910
So I'm scared that

649
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,373
I'll one day follow my dad.

650
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,543
"Forget it. I quit.

651
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,838
I can't take it anymore."

652
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,923
It scares me.

653
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,427
Is that how my dad was?

654
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,264
Did my dad

655
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,311
also have

656
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,689
no reason to live?

657
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,234
Your dad, Jun-seok,
was a reporter at the time.

658
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,152
He was investigating a story,

659
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,822
and he supposedly found some money.

660
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,783
And because of that money,

661
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,077
he killed someone.

662
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,123
My dad killed...

663
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,337
He killed someone?

664
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,464
That's what the record said.

665
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,551
I checked as soon as
I was released from prison.

666
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,223
My dad killed someone?

667
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,476
He supposedly killed himself
while under investigation

668
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,686
because the guilt was too much.

669
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,939
But I found it extremely weird, Jeong-hu.

670
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,274
I see.

671
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,736
So my dad killed a person.

672
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,696
So that's why

673
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,532
he died too.

674
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,535
Snap out of it and listen to me.
That's what people said,

675
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,329
but I never believed any of it.

676
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,372
-He--
-So!

677
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:30,790
So!

678
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,876
So,

679
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,755
my dad was a murderer.

680
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,633
And

681
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:42,969
I am

682
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,555
a thief.

683
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,267
-That's who we are.
-Jeong-hu, hear me out.

684
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,741
What a fucked up life.

685
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,955
This is insane.

686
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,002
Why did you tell me?

687
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,672
Why did you?

688
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,008
Since when do you answer everything I ask?

689
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,928
Why did you tell me, you old geezer? Why?

690
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,811
You shouldn't have told me.

691
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,562
Listen up, Seo Jeong-hu.

692
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,232
Your dad, Seo Jun-seok,

693
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,818
would never kill anyone.

694
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,778
I know that for a fact.

695
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,240
You may not know it, but I do.

696
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,951
So if you're going to react like that,

697
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,869
find out the truth first.

698
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,329
Find out who

699
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,623
killed your dad.

700
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,333
What?

701
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,628
I gave up midway.

702
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,213
But...

703
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,340
what about you?

704
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:49,012
I have a request for Healer.

705
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,894
You have a visitor.

706
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:00,231
YOU HAVE A VISITOR

707
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,188
There are five people in this picture,

708
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,023
but there is a sixth person.

709
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,193
The person who took this picture.

710
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,613
I couldn't ask him
when I was investigating into

711
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,824
what happened to your dad

712
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,494
because he was just a kid back then.

713
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,705
I think I wanted to protect him

714
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:02,127
because he was like
a little brother to all of us.

715
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,560
I don't know

716
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,604
what I need to do

717
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,525
or how much it costs to hire you, Healer.

718
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,194
I don't even know...

719
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:36,828
whether this email will reach you,

720
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,205
but I am writing it anyway.

721
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,176
Darn it.

722
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,304
I am Chae Yeong-sin.

723
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:41,017
