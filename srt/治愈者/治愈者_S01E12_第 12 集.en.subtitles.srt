1
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,645
You said they show case files
to family members, right?

2
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,818
I'm immediate family.

3
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,612
My dad is immediate family.

4
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,697
SEO JUN-SEOK

5
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,616
RESTRICTED DOCUMENT
IDENTIFICATION MUST BE VERIFIED

6
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,451
Where are we going, mister?

7
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,203
Master once said

8
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,206
that the best bait when fishing
is yourself.

9
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,710
But has Master ever gone fishing himself?

10
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,134
So what's the deal?

11
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,179
Why is the owner of Jeil News here?

12
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,764
I wouldn't know.

13
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:42,185
Maybe the plan was to send
his brother first to take over Someday,

14
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,730
and now he's here to acquire it
as a subsidiary.

15
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,648
Chief.

16
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,443
That means I'll at least
be a chief at Jeil News.

17
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,986
The salary raise alone...

18
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,489
Stop drooling. You're dribbling.

19
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,668
Have some citron tea.

20
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,630
We don't have any nice tea sets, so...

21
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,006
Thank you.

22
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,176
I called Mun-ho, I mean...

23
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,888
I called Mr. Kim, so he'll be here soon.

24
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,519
Please, have some. I brought two.

25
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,943
You're very cheerful and polite.

26
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,654
Cheerful and polite?

27
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,160
Well, I guess I am.

28
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,452
Thank you.

29
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,525
Are you thirsty?

30
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,612
Wait here. I'll get you
something to drink.

31
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,239
Stay right here.

32
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,753
Mommy...

33
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,267
I saw you
at Assemblyman Kim's press conference.

34
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,644
You were very brave.

35
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:34,315
Well, I only did as Mun-ho taught me.

36
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,484
How tall are you?

37
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,320
-Excuse me?
-You looked tall on TV.

38
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,073
Let me see.

39
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,123
Well, I was wearing high heels then.

40
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,708
But now, I am...

41
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,001
You're similar in height.

42
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,837
Or aren't you?

43
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,798
Are you smaller?

44
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,301
Than who?

45
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,975
Yeong-sin, get out.

46
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,351
Sure.

47
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,539
What is it? What's going on?

48
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,424
You scared her.

49
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,346
-How dare you come here.
-Mun-ho.

50
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,477
How dare you meet her?

51
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:58,649
How could you not tremble or
fall to your knees at the sight of her?

52
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,695
You do realize...

53
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,824
she is in danger now

54
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,370
because of you, right?

55
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,086
If you stay out of her life,
she won't be in danger.

56
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,506
You probably thought
if you showed her to the world on TV,

57
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,927
no one would be able to touch her.

58
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,805
Why? Was it insufficient?

59
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,890
Should I do it again?

60
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,974
Thanks to you,

61
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,020
I may be running for mayor of Seoul.

62
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,983
You dragged Kim Ui-chan down
with that ridiculous broadcast,

63
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,737
so I'm being pushed into that spot.

64
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,073
Is that person pushing you

65
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,993
the one your people call Boss?

66
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:56,457
Yes, Boss thinks Ji-an is my weakness.

67
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,588
He thinks he needs
to eliminate my weaknesses.

68
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,473
That kid is in danger, Mun-ho.

69
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,146
So I need to take her.

70
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,314
I'll keep her safe

71
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,067
by my side.

72
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,323
-You'll take her and keep her safe?
-Yes.

73
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,161
How?

74
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,290
Will you break her legs,
so she can't move?

75
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:42,211
Will you build a cage
and lock her up in it?

76
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,964
That way you can keep her safe, right?

77
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,306
Watch what you're saying.

78
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,058
That's how you protect people.

79
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,395
What are you doing
using kids who know nothing?

80
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,356
Did you bring Seo Jeong-hu?

81
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,108
What are you thinking?

82
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,361
Are you two digging up
what happened 22 years ago?

83
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,991
Seo Jeong-hu?

84
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,577
Do you mean Jun-seok's son?

85
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,831
You found him too? So, what?

86
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,709
Will you get rid of him
like you did with Ji-an?

87
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,129
You can't afford him to
become your weakness

88
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,714
and have your past revealed.

89
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,426
Not long ago,

90
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,721
someone came to my house.

91
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,642
I think it may have been him.

92
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,894
I didn't get to ask him

93
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,897
because he left in such a hurry.

94
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,520
Seo Jeong-hu?

95
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,986
That's the fifth time
someone asked me my name.

96
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,197
"Seo Jeong-hu? Are you Seo Jeong-hu?"

97
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,033
Yes, I am Seo Jeong-hu.

98
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,620
You requested documents on Seo Jun-seok?

99
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,874
Yes, I did.

100
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,378
You're Seo Jun-seok's son, correct?

101
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,840
Yes, my dad's name was Seo Jun-seok.

102
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,469
Someone would like to meet you.
Would you come with me?

103
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,933
Your father's friend is waiting for you.

104
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,439
Fine.

105
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,150
Jeez.

106
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,446
I'm still half-asleep.

107
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,040
What are you doing? Hurry up.

108
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,293
Hurry up. Let's go.

109
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,846
You seem tired.

110
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,600
Yes. I just got to Korea,

111
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,603
so I'm still jetlagged.

112
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,939
I should get some sleep.

113
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,210
You're so lucky

114
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,045
to live in a nice house like this.

115
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,297
Please, it's this way.

116
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,091
Where? There? Okay.

117
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,846
Wow. Are these all books?

118
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,765
On the upper floor too!

119
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,226
Do they collect books or something?

120
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,478
This is amazing.

121
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,522
Hello.

122
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,944
Are you Seo Jeong-hu?

123
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,862
Sixth time.

124
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,574
That was the sixth time today.
Yes, I am Seo Jeong-hu.

125
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,411
My gosh, Jeong-hu.

126
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,205
Welcome.

127
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,584
Thanks.

128
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,921
Don't you remember me at all?

129
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,508
No, I don't.

130
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,390
-Here, come and sit.
-I was too young.

131
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,855
Still, I'm hurt.

132
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,482
I used to give you piggyback rides.

133
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,776
Your dad and I were very close.

134
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,949
Then are you one of them?

135
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,453
-What?
-You see, I have a photo.

136
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,706
There are five people in it.

137
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,084
So, my dad's there, and some woman and...

138
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,087
Are you one of...

139
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,214
-Yes.
-Really?

140
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,259
I was one of them. There were five of us.

141
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,597
Awesome! I hit the jackpot
as soon as I came to Korea.

142
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,975
Weren't you in Korea?

143
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,811
No, I was in Russia.

144
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,230
-Russia?
-Yes.

145
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,483
I studied abroad.

146
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,568
Who's here?

147
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,613
He said it's someone you must meet.

148
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,368
You must be super rich

149
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,496
and very high up, right?

150
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,165
I don't know if I'm that high up.

151
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,879
That's how you got me out
when I was locked up.

152
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,964
Oh, that?

153
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,217
I'm curious though.

154
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,678
Why was I locked up earlier?

155
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,682
And how did you know I was locked up?

156
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,394
If anyone asks about your father,

157
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,189
they're supposed to keep them there
and report to me.

158
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,485
I made sure that when they report it,
I hear about it first.

159
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,155
-Why?
-I told you.

160
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,824
We were very close friends.

161
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,705
So, friends tell each other everything?

162
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,082
It's so cool, isn't it?

163
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,294
I hear we have a guest.

164
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,425
Say hello.

165
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,596
Hello.

166
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,599
We have a young guest.

167
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,103
Don't you recognize him?
Doesn't he look like someone?

168
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,398
-Who?
-He looks like Seo Jun-seok.

169
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,196
I don't see it. No way.

170
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,575
He's Jun-seok's son.

171
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,914
Hello.

172
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,125
I'm Seo Jeong-hu.

173
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,267
Can you come over here?

174
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,490
I...

175
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,244
I can't stand up.

176
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,413
So, do you mind sitting?

177
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,250
Let me see

178
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,045
your face up close.

179
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,812
Jeong-hu.

180
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,231
Yes?

181
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,068
You have gotten so big.

182
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,530
You were so small, but you're so big now.

183
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,974
I have seen this face before.

184
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,519
I know I have.

185
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,698
What?

186
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,076
Oh, I have something to tell you...

187
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,038
I'll come back later.

188
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,248
Come in.

189
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,065
I have an item
that I would like to work on.

190
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,650
I really want to do it.

191
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,402
What is it?

192
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,282
I want to reinvestigate Hwang Je-guk.

193
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,534
I looked into it and they say

194
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,078
Hwang Je-guk committed suicide.

195
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,623
He left a suicide note
and the case has been closed.

196
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,126
Something feels wrong.

197
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,254
-What?
-It's too easy.

198
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,423
Well, it's sort of like someone

199
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,384
framed him for all of the crimes

200
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,053
and is trying to get away with it.

201
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,679
You hated Hwang Je-guk.

202
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,140
You were cornered because of Joo Yeon-hui

203
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,518
and even Someday was sued.

204
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,689
Now you're all free from that
because he died.

205
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,275
-Shouldn't you be happy?
-I am happy.

206
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,570
Well, it sounds bad
that I'm happy someone died.

207
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,366
Anyway, a reporter must uncover
truth and justice.

208
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,661
I can't be blinded
by my personal emotions.

209
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,915
I jotted down some suspicions

210
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,167
and some things
that need to be investigated.

211
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,049
When people cry about truth and justice,

212
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,384
you need to read between the lines

213
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,429
because those are words
you don't really need to say

214
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,265
if you have no ulterior motives.

215
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,603
What are you really after?

216
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,485
Actually, a detective came to see me.

217
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,363
He had suspicions about Ko Seong-cheol,

218
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,407
the guy Hwang Je-guk confessed
in his suicide note of killing,

219
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,036
and Hwang Je-guk's suicide itself.

220
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,665
-Suspicions?
-He thinks Healer killed them.

221
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,006
So?

222
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,467
I want to reveal the truth.

223
00:18:55,843 --> 00:19:00,472
I learned that detectives handle cases,
but reporters handle the truth.

224
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:01,974
Am I right?

225
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,232
That young man really is Seo Jeong-hu.

226
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,526
I'm verifying
whether he really just came to Korea.

227
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,736
We'll know tomorrow.

228
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,780
Myeong-hui is

229
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,367
a terrible liar.

230
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,621
In the rare occasion that she does lie,

231
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,250
she always gets caught.

232
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,419
She was always like that.

233
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,630
Then do you still suspect him?

234
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,091
Do you think he could be Healer?

235
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,759
Well...

236
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,388
I think she is lying.

237
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,100
What could it be?

238
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,147
Why is Myeong-hui lying to me?

239
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,284
Come here. Sit.

240
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,085
Do you remember what your dad looked like?

241
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,380
He was always smiling and joking around.

242
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,307
This is your dad.

243
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,355
What?

244
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,275
Actually, I heard

245
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,945
something from someone.

246
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,196
What is it?

247
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,323
I heard my dad

248
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,577
killed a friend.

249
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,830
And I heard that

250
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,541
it was this man.

251
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,213
I also heard these two were married.

252
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,257
-So, this woman--
-That's me.

253
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,678
We were married.

254
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,351
Then, my dad

255
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,523
killed your husband?

256
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,747
Myeong-hui, let's stop here.

257
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,795
No, Jeong-hu.

258
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,925
No. Your dad did no such thing.

259
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,136
Is that what you came here to find out?

260
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,473
Yes.

261
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,686
I'm sorry, but can you leave us?
She isn't well.

262
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,655
Take my hand.

263
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,456
You're brave.

264
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,542
You could have just buried it.

265
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,711
You could have.

266
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,172
I'm sure no one knows.

267
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,760
You see,

268
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:29,765
I like someone now. So I had to find out

269
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,728
what my dad was like,
and if I could like her.

270
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:38,940
I see.

271
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:41,818
Right.

272
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,409
Ji-an, are you seeing this?

273
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,204
Jeong-hu grew up so handsome.

274
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,629
Jeong-hu. Jeong-hu, play with me.

275
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,757
Ji-an!

276
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,553
What is...

277
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,264
What is her name again?

278
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,268
Ji-an.

279
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,980
Our Ji-an.

280
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,983
My daughter.

281
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,654
The two of you were very close.

282
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,492
Wait outside.

283
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,175
Myeong-hui.

284
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,308
Myeong-hui.

285
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,783
I figured out where I saw him.

286
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,493
Healer, are you listening?

287
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,914
Remember after that elevator accident?

288
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,543
I checked all the security videos nearby.

289
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:28,925
I have been looking up everyone
who passed by the area around that time.

290
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,846
I couldn't find anything on a few of them.

291
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,055
He was one of them.

292
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:42,439
He was near the building
around the time of the elevator accident.

293
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,581
This is either a very big coincidence,

294
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,417
or he is the one
who tried to kill Yeong-sin.

295
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,387
I wanted to know

296
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,600
just who was spending
so much money to find this girl.

297
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,519
Gil-han had a daughter.

298
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,231
-What happened to her?
-She died.

299
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,026
Jeong-hu.

300
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,488
Stop running around.

301
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,824
If you keep running,
I won't let you into this island.

302
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,326
It's Unknown Island!

303
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,996
Ji-an!

304
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,126
Ji-an.

305
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,307
How long were you going to lie to me?

306
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,766
How much did you find out?

307
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,230
Why didn't you tell me

308
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,899
who Yeong-sin really is?

309
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,569
Why did you say she died?

310
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,113
You should have told me.

311
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,698
Ji-an was in danger.

312
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,783
I'll explain.

313
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:04,122
I know your explanations very well.

314
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,043
You lie and make things up on the spot.

315
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,422
-Jeong-hu.
-Everyone keeps lying.

316
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,217
So, even if you say that my dad
is not a murderer,

317
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,137
no matter how much you people say that,

318
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,056
I can't...

319
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,894
believe it.

320
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,396
I couldn't tell you about Ji-an

321
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,066
because I had to protect her.

322
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,693
Her mother is alive.

323
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,697
You see her every day,
but yet you say nothing.

324
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,909
-That's protecting her?
-If she finds out

325
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,410
and her mom finds out,

326
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,788
she will really

327
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,416
lose her mom, do you understand?

328
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,380
What did you people do?

329
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,509
What did you do to us?

330
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,802
What?

331
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,638
I'm sorry.

332
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,230
Leave us alone.

333
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,567
Yeong-sin and I have been fine
living without you people

334
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,403
and we will be going forward.

335
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,864
We will protect ourselves
perfectly fine without you too,

336
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,576
so stay out of our lives.

337
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,203
Jeong-hu.

338
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,331
There is still much that you don't know.

339
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,252
-Those people are the kind that'll--
-I don't care.

340
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,421
Don't you get it?

341
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,548
I don't care who's involved.

342
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,051
Just keep to yourselves

343
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,972
and we'll do the same.

344
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,765
What about your dad?

345
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,314
What will you do about your dad's case?

346
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,899
My dad's problem is...

347
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,862
between me and my dad,

348
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,197
so stay out of it.

349
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,726
Hello...

350
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,647
Hey, Bong-su.

351
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,110
Weren't you mad at me?

352
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,571
That's been really bugging me.

353
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,996
-What's wrong?
-Yeong-sin.

354
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,581
What is it?

355
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,043
I'm having a really tough time right now.

356
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,670
Will you help me?

357
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,631
Sure, I'll...

358
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,218
Hey.

359
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,727
Why are you so cold?

360
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,063
You're freezing.

361
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,580
Hey, Bong-su.

362
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,334
I think that's enough.

363
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,587
Not yet.

364
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,179
Not yet? Right? Not yet?

365
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,848
No, that's enough.

366
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,016
I give up.

367
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,739
So, you can't go home because of bugs?

368
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,908
The exterminator said
it would take a few days.

369
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,869
What bug did you say it was?

370
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,413
Camel crickets.

371
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,332
They spread out all over the place

372
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,169
and each one is this big.

373
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,213
They don't travel alone either.

374
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,548
They go...

375
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:24,841
Anyway,

376
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,759
so you need a place to crash.

377
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,805
Yes, I can sleep on the couch
like last time,

378
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,849
or I can sleep out here.

379
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,559
I just need a blanket.

380
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,769
Your family is rich. Go to a hotel.

381
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,772
Hotels are scary. I can't go alone.

382
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,357
What about your family?

383
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,068
I live alone.

384
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,864
-What about your family?
-My dad...

385
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,743
My mom remarried long ago,

386
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,870
and my dad passed away when I was young.

387
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:06,799
Come here.

388
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,774
My dad and Uncle went to a funeral.

389
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,027
I'll call and ask them later and...

390
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:30,865
What?

391
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,454
You said

392
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,123
you like someone.

393
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,459
I do. So?

394
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,836
But you hug any man who asks

395
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,172
for comfort and a place to stay.

396
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,467
You think you're a man?

397
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,846
You just clung to me crying
after freaking out from bugs

398
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,140
and said that you're petrified.

399
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,978
How am I supposed to handle
you suddenly calling yourself a man?

400
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,688
Camel crickets are seriously scary.

401
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,776
Anyway, I'm going to charge you
for lodging, got it?

402
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,861
Hello.

403
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,241
What would you like?

404
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,452
-One americano and...
-One americano.

405
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,662
A caramel macchiato.

406
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,999
Would you like some whipped cream on top?

407
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,340
MYEONG-HUI

408
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,345
The person you have called
is unavailable...

409
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,482
-Dr. Choi.
-Reporter Kim, it's been a while.

410
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,109
Is something wrong with Myeong-hui?

411
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,278
She's calm now.

412
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,697
I told Mr. Kim that we'll see
how she does.

413
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,742
If she gets worse though,
she should go to the hospital.

414
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,022
Seo Jeong-hu came by earlier.
He's Jun-seok's son.

415
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,358
That kid doesn't know
what and what not to say.

416
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,196
Look at what he did to her.

417
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:39,035
Did you tell him what he knows?

418
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,872
Is that why he suddenly came here?

419
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,500
What else did you say, and to whom?

420
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,086
How much does Ji-an know?

421
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,130
You know, I always thought

422
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,801
that I was a better person than you.

423
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,302
But...

424
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,765
you were the only role model I had

425
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,267
while growing up.

426
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:09,065
That's why I became someone just like you.

427
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,112
-So?
-I don't think it's too bad.

428
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,621
If it's dirty,
you should clean it with a rag.

429
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,207
A white towel would be a waste.

430
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,963
Let's talk.

431
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,674
I came to see Myeong-hui, not you.

432
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,820
If Seo Jeong-hu is Healer
and Mun-ho is behind him,

433
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,448
we can assume Healer has Boss' video.

434
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,995
I have emailed Healer,
but he hasn't responded.

435
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,706
He won't budge,
no matter how much we offer.

436
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,375
There is no other way to reach him.

437
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,502
Then we'll make him come to us.

438
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,797
I didn't want to go this far but...

439
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,343
What a shame.

440
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,683
What are you doing?

441
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,813
-So you want me to...
-Peel them.

442
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,956
Forget it. Forget the potatoes.

443
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,629
Peel the onions with the small knife.

444
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,380
Can you do it?

445
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,107
-Bong-su.
-Yes?

446
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,735
At least wash the gunk out of your eyes.

447
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,487
-Gunk?
-Left eye.

448
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,006
Thank you for the food.

449
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,555
Thank you...

450
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,495
What's wrong?

451
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,956
Why? Does it taste bad?

452
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,379
It tastes fine.

453
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,638
You're unbelievable.

454
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,391
-Don't eat it.
-No, it's good.

455
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,270
What do you mean, lock my door?

456
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,023
Dad, it's Bong-su. Bong-su.

457
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,692
Okay. Drive safely. Sure.

458
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,323
Dad and Uncle won't be back
for a few hours.

459
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,407
He said to just go to sleep.

460
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,618
I can wait. I should say hi--

461
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,704
These are my dad's, so they are pretty big

462
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,581
but you need pajamas.

463
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,166
Oh, sorry.

464
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,790
-What...
-Hold on.

465
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,897
I must have lost my mind.

466
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,775
I'm sorry. Good night.

467
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,752
That woman Myeong-hui
is Kim Mun-sik's wife now.

468
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,047
Can you get her medical records?

469
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,676
I want to know what will happen to her

470
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,846
if she finds out
her dead daughter is alive.

471
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,222
Is this a formal request?

472
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,183
Just take my money, okay?

473
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,896
You manage my accounts anyway,
so take what you want.

474
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,234
Then I'll do this for free, on the house.

475
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,279
Let me give you an analysis
of your condition.

476
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,866
Do you realize you are a tin robot

477
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,659
with a malfunctioning AI?

478
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:57,997
Jeez. You must be hungry again

479
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,416
seeing as you're nagging. Right?

480
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,501
You lose your mind over some girl,

481
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,837
are careless with her phone,

482
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,047
and get your identity exposed.

483
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,134
As soon as you hear about your dad,
you expose your identity

484
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,969
and run into the enemy camp.

485
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,053
So, now what?

486
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,639
You go somewhere filled with cops.

487
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,391
What for? To protect whom?

488
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,102
You must be getting old.

489
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,397
You have been talking a lot lately.

490
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,109
I told you about Superman before, right?

491
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,029
The guy who went undercover for some girl.

492
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,157
He had one weakness.

493
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,258
Are you listening?

494
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,511
Yes.

495
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:59,975
But I think people to you
are like that stone from the comic book.

496
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,269
Ms. Jo...

497
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:07,650
People, human beings,
are your Kryptonite or something.

498
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,486
I know, okay?

499
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,031
I know that you secretly really like me.

500
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,576
-Who is this?
-You knew, didn't you?

501
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,248
You knew about what my dad

502
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,501
supposedly did to Yeong-sin's dad.

503
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,672
That's why you were trying
to keep us apart, right?

504
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,092
In case I'd get hurt.

505
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,469
Were you

506
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:37,805
hurt?

507
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,975
I don't even remember
what my dad looked like.

508
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,354
All I know is the face in the picture.

509
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:53,195
What he did 20 years ago
has nothing to do with me? Right?

510
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,157
If he didn't kill

511
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,536
the father of the girl I like...

512
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,213
Ms. Jo.

513
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,173
What?

514
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,553
I like Yeong-sin.

515
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,598
You just realized that?

516
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,479
So, I'm prepared.

517
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,442
Even if I get hurt,
there is nothing I can do.

518
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,485
It's okay if she doesn't know.

519
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,738
Still, I have to stay by her side.

520
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,160
Don't tell me to run away.

521
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,205
Because I

522
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,541
don't know how.

523
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,683
Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan, who is
suspected of receiving sexual bribes

524
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,518
was summoned by the prosecutor today.

525
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,772
Assemblyman Kim denies all allegations,

526
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,275
but the prosecutor is investigating
Hwang's suicide note

527
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,444
and the videos of the sexual bribes.

528
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,447
If he is found guilty,
they will request imprisonment...

529
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,410
I'll announce Someday News' new project.

530
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,453
Yes, sir.

531
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,164
We just watched Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan.

532
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:31,043
Given the headlines,
he will most likely be ousted.

533
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,421
It looks like his party
already abandoned him too.

534
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:38,300
That means they'll nominate
a new mayoral candidate

535
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,804
and that person will be
the subject of our new special.

536
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,850
Did they announce it already?
Why don't I know this?

537
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,771
They haven't announced it yet.
I found out personally.

538
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,981
So, who is it?

539
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,316
Kim Mun-sik.

540
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,778
The owner of Jeil News.

541
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,154
What?

542
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:02,908
News about him will start popping up soon,

543
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,829
stuff like his secret accomplishments.

544
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,622
How he has some
impressive people's support...

545
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,333
Wait, so you're saying...

546
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,043
Mr. Kim,

547
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:18,465
do you mean your brother?

548
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,802
Yes, he came by here a few days ago.

549
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:30,018
You acquired Someday News,
and the very first special broadcast

550
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,104
crippled Kim Ui-chan's career.

551
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,273
It was a huge success which was nice.

552
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,860
Thanks to that,
Someday News became more well-known.

553
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,237
You know,

554
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,990
I thought that was really cool.

555
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,452
That is how I truly felt.

556
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,038
-But now, I see...
-What do you see?

557
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:54,251
This was all a campaign scam
for your brother.

558
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,046
Sure, I understand.
That's how the world works.

559
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,050
I get it. I do.
But I can't stay here any longer.

560
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,261
-Hey you, spy.
-Yes?

561
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,222
-Do you report daily?
-I am to report twice a week

562
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,141
and immediately if anything happens.

563
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,142
Go and report that

564
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:14,980
Someday's Kim Mun-ho
is doing a feature on Kim Mun-sik.

565
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,983
The mayorship is in the bag, isn't it?

566
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:23,030
Tell him that because I personally know
a lot about Kim Mun-sik,

567
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,407
it will be quite interesting.

568
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,201
Here's the first item.

569
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,745
"How did he obtain his wealth?"

570
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,166
Doesn't that sound like a nice start?

571
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,503
My goal is to alert the public of

572
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,922
who must not become the mayor of Seoul.

573
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:59,149
WE SHOULD HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER
FROM JEONG-HU

574
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:06,907
HWANG JE-GUK

575
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,576
That has everything I've gathered.

576
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,914
It has everything on the people
Hwang Je-guk bribed.

577
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,707
Thank you.

578
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,544
Look into their relationships.

579
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,420
The fastest way would be
to follow the money.

580
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,549
No matter how powerful
or connected they are,

581
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,509
they will be tied together by money.

582
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,972
I'll meet with the detective first,
that suspicious one.

583
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:33,433
Good. Work with Bong-su on this one.

584
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,602
Teach him how to be a reporter.

585
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,437
I'll teach him well.

586
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,023
Bong-su, let's go.

587
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,738
You said Yeong-sin is in danger.

588
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,783
So why are you letting her run around?

589
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,243
You said you'd protect her.

590
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,333
Are you tired? Do you want one?

591
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,836
You're unbelievable.

592
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,800
It's too late to run or hide.

593
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,553
We have to counterattack.

594
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,472
So, you'll leave her in the dark and--

595
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,682
I'm waiting

596
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,394
for Ji-an to come to me on her own.

597
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,899
I'm sure she'll punch me first
for deceiving her.

598
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,196
Someone I know would have said this.

599
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,242
"Even his bullshit is creative."

600
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,048
Text from Chae Yeong-sin.

601
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,135
"Can you talk? I would like to meet."

602
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,389
Text from Chae Yeong-sin.

603
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,560
"Can you talk? I would like to meet."

604
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,442
SEARCHING FOR SEO JEONG-HU

605
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,742
SEARCHING FOR SEO JEONG-HU

606
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,966
-Yeong-sin.
-Yes?

607
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,009
Nothing.

608
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,641
-Yeong-sin.
-What is it?

609
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,521
I have a question.

610
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,772
So, ask.

611
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:31,027
-Do you--
-Hello?

612
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,822
Hello, Detective Yoon.

613
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,490
Excuse me? Where?

614
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,744
Okay, we'll come to you.

615
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,165
It isn't far from here.

616
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,460
I'll call you when I'm there.

617
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,130
You need to see something.
Can you check your email?

618
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,968
Bong-su, can we go to Eastern Mall?

619
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,554
You wear glasses?

620
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,847
Just sometimes.

621
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,308
I wear them when I can't see at times

622
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,143
or if I have to see something else.

623
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,980
I told Detective Yoon
we'd see him at Eastern Mall.

624
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,774
How long will it take to get there?

625
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,194
We're getting an email every 30 minutes.

626
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:21,703
Hey.

627
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,291
Where?

628
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,084
Didn't you hear me?

629
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,337
I'm tracking your mom's phone.

630
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,298
But Healer, this is obviously a trap.

631
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:37,052
-So, where is it?
-I told you. It's Eastern Mall.

632
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,514
It's at Seongsan Rotary near Kia Station.

633
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,143
We're not in a rush. You can slow down.

634
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,937
What's the fastest route?

635
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,480
I don't know.

636
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,607
I think Kim Mun-sik set this trap.
If you go,

637
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,944
you're announcing
that Seo Jeong-hu is Healer.

638
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,862
I'm calling your master now.

639
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,155
He should look into--

640
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,907
Tell me the fastest route!

641
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,327
Make a right at Royal Department Store.

642
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,259
-Do you have a reservation?
-Yes.

643
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,760
-This way, please.
-Thank you.

644
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,222
-Just a moment, please.
-Sure.

645
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,486
God, help me.

646
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,604
You put a tracker
in Kim Mun-sik's assistant's car

647
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,690
when you went to his house, right?

648
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,610
That car is headed toward your mom.

649
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,028
It's almost there.

650
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,161
Do you...

651
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,124
remember me?

652
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,209
Attorney Baek?

653
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,092
We got another email.

654
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,260
It's another photo.

655
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,822
Is that for your son?

656
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,702
Yes, he doesn't bundle up enough.

657
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,999
Which son do you mean?

658
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:18,630
Isn't your oldest son's name Jeong-hu?

659
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,342
Do you see him often?

660
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,647
I'm sorry, but I need to go somewhere.
It's urgent.

661
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,650
Sure, I'll wait, but what's the...

662
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,281
Excuse me.

663
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,409
-Yes?
-Did you see the person who was here?

664
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,077
Oh, that lady?

665
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,329
She just left out the back...

666
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,706
Sir!

667
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,336
Ms. Jo, find my mom.
She isn't in the restaurant.

668
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,797
I think she went
toward Assistant Oh's car.

669
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,257
The two signals are merging.

670
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,596
Check the garage.
I'll check the security feeds.

671
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,852
You reserved this table, right?

672
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,938
She left already.

673
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:00,815
Excuse me?

674
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,780
What? What's going on? Hey!

675
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,784
I really shouldn't do this

676
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,746
but it's a dire situation,
so I have no choice.

677
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,668
Your mom is in Assistant Oh's car.

678
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,799
Check the garage for me.

679
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,592
See if I'll be ambushed.

680
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,845
I'm almost done. Just a minute.

681
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,527
Ms. Jo?

682
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,118
What's going on?

683
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,467
Come on!

684
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,971
Shit!

685
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,099
What? Damn it!

686
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,645
Ms. Jo!

687
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,315
I need to know what's down there.

688
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,234
Ms. Jo.

689
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,713
Yes.

690
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,507
Get him.

691
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,182
Where is he?

692
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:52,987
What's going on?

693
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,755
Oh dear, the door must be locked.

694
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,051
Hello, Healer. I'm so happy to meet you.

695
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,886
Will you show me your face?

696
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,453
Healer.

697
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,497
Hello?

698
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,457
Kid, where are you?

699
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,960
What's wrong with your vitals?

700
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,504
Answer the phone!

701
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,282
-Hello?
-Chae Yeong-sin?

702
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,367
Yes, this is she.

703
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,828
You know Park Bong-su, don't you?

704
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,121
Yes, I do.

705
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,123
Will you find him for me?

706
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,668
I think he's in grave danger.
