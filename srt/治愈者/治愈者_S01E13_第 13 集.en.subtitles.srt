1
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,133
God, help me.

2
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,094
Healer, this is obviously a trap.

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,014
I heard you met my boss's wife
not long ago.

4
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,433
What did you talk about?

5
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,894
Did your son...

6
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,854
Seo Jeong-hu, was it?

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,817
Did he ask her to find out
about something?

8
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,113
I haven't seen my son in over ten years.

9
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,365
He hasn't called once.

10
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,786
He was going to study abroad,
but I don't know where.

11
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,708
You know I abandoned
my young son when I remarried.

12
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,461
How could I expect him to call?

13
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,548
I'm sure Jeong-hu forgot
about me a long time ago.

14
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,134
Are you meeting someone?

15
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,428
-Who...
-A friend.

16
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,388
I'm meeting a friend too.

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,933
I'll wait with you then.

18
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,403
-I need to use the restroom.
-Go ahead.

19
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,837
Don't come, Jeong-hu. You shouldn't come.

20
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,259
I think she went
toward Assistant Oh's car.

21
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,177
The two signals are merging.

22
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,155
Too bad, the door must be locked.

23
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,867
Hello, Healer. It's been a while.

24
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,911
I'm so happy to see you.

25
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,954
Will you show me your face?

26
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,503
Oh dear. I have been caught.

27
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,264
-Hello?
-Chae Yeong-sin?

28
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,183
Yes, speaking.

29
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,644
You know Park Bong-su, don't you?

30
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,981
He should be somewhere in that building.

31
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,110
We were disconnected. I think he's hurt.

32
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,238
-Bong-suk!
-Can you find him for me?

33
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,351
I sent you the license plate number,
so track them!

34
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,397
Seeing them clear out like this
means they caught who they came for.

35
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,357
I need to find out who that is.

36
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,441
Hurry!

37
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,682
You still haven't found Bong-su?

38
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,976
Those thugs just took someone.

39
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,477
You said Bong-su was hurt, right?

40
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,439
There is blood on the ground.
That means they have--

41
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,817
No, they didn't.
They didn't, so snap out of it.

42
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,739
-How do you know?
-His location hasn't changed.

43
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,159
So go look for him.
There must be somewhere he can hide.

44
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,705
Who are you? How do you know that?

45
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,041
I don't have time
to give you a lecture right now.

46
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,633
I like high places.

47
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,556
I can see people there,

48
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,017
but they can't see me.

49
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,175
Bong-su!

50
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,322
Hello?

51
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,533
A person is passed out here.

52
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,119
He's bleeding heavily. I'm at...

53
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,538
I'm on the roof of Seongmin Mall.

54
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,458
His body feels very cold. Please...

55
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,669
Please hurry.

56
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,386
He may have hypothermia.

57
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,596
His wound isn't severe,
but he's unconscious.

58
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,849
His BP is 80 over 50.
His temperature is 35.5Â°C.

59
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,518
Get him a heating lamp and some hot packs.

60
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,646
I don't smell alcohol.
Did he take any drugs?

61
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,772
He is completely unconscious.

62
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,232
No, there's no way.

63
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,526
-Let's stitch up the wound right now.
-Okay.

64
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,528
He bled a lot. Will he be okay?

65
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,822
He's very muscular,
so the wound isn't deep.

66
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,411
Hello, Detective Yoon.

67
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,123
No, I didn't wait long.

68
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,833
Something came up for me as well.

69
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,255
Yes, then call me
when you have time. I'll be waiting.

70
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,257
Yes.

71
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,057
UNREGISTERED NUMBER

72
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:03,524
The number you have called
is not in service...

73
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,411
Bong-su, it's time to wake up.

74
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,415
I have so many questions to ask.

75
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,545
What were you doing over there
in the cold?

76
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,841
You were bleeding so much
and even unconscious.

77
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,718
Do you know how scared I was?

78
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,060
And who was that woman who called me?

79
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,813
I tried that number,
but it isn't in service.

80
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,158
Bong-suk, it's time to wake up.

81
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,037
Bong-suk? Wake up.

82
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,851
-Are you awake?
-Chae Yeong-sin...

83
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,187
Did you just say my name?

84
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,112
Chae Yeong-sin.

85
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,879
Is he really on drugs or something?

86
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,642
Hold on.

87
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,255
How many?

88
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,633
Two.

89
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,041
CAR REGISTRATION
KIM BYEONG-SEON

90
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,913
I'm sure he has something to say to me.

91
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,333
He can't not say anything like this.

92
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,876
I'm...

93
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,090
ready to listen to him.

94
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,681
What about me?

95
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,641
If you want,

96
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,896
I can live as the person you want me to.

97
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,818
For as long as possible
while being very careful,

98
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,071
I can be here for you.

99
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,672
Did you get enough sleep?

100
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,426
The doctor said you were just sleeping.

101
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,887
I slept quite a bit.

102
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,598
How do you feel?

103
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,269
Fine, thanks to you.

104
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,314
I heard you brought me here.

105
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,528
Did she tell you that I brought you here?

106
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,365
Well, that's because...

107
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,371
I'm Chae Yeong-sin.
I'm his senior at work.

108
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,832
She's a friend that I know.

109
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,127
Hello.

110
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,925
Oh, right. Here's your car key.

111
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,636
I'll pay the hospital bill
and pull the car up front.

112
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,770
Yeong-sin, the thing is...

113
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,773
I haven't been able to sleep,
so I took sleeping pills.

114
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,694
And I think the pills really got to me.
So...

115
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,072
Oh, and this...

116
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,785
I dozed off and fell...

117
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,040
You're leaving?

118
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,751
Yes.

119
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,255
With that friend of yours?

120
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,257
Yes.

121
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,722
How did she know that you were here?

122
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,640
You were sleeping the entire time.

123
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,445
Oh, that's right.

124
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,780
Someone called me earlier.

125
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,033
She sounded like your mother or something.

126
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,578
She was worried that you got disconnected.

127
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,039
I should have called her,

128
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,291
but I forgot after all that's happened.

129
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,380
Your mother must have called
every hospital in the area, right?

130
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,633
Probably.

131
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,886
Go on. Your friend must be waiting.

132
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,432
You must have been shocked...

133
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,893
because of me.

134
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:38,896
Yes, I was.

135
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,232
I'm sorry.

136
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,293
Bong-su.

137
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
You're coming to work tomorrow, right?

138
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:13,973
Right?

139
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,422
Your mother is home safe and sound.

140
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,633
I'm watching a security camera
in front of her house.

141
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,676
Where is Master?

142
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,761
Sang-su's boys took him.

143
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,391
That old geezer. Why did he have to...

144
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:01,103
He isn't dead yet, so let's wait and see.

145
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,271
Wait and see?

146
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,568
Are you sure you're okay?

147
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,030
That tranquilizer can take down elephants.

148
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,283
With the wrong dosage, it can kill people.

149
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,660
Those ignorant fools.

150
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,597
So, where should we go?

151
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:41,018
Dae-yong, let's let Healer rest
a little first, so--

152
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,394
Take me to Kim Mun-sik's house.

153
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,271
Why?

154
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,648
He went after my mom.

155
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,360
And he even went after Yeong-sin.

156
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,362
So? What will you do?

157
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,198
I'll have to stop him.

158
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,160
What? You'll beat him up
like you did Hwang Je-guk?

159
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,620
I'll kill him.

160
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,288
Idiot.

161
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,333
Dae-yong, Gwanghwamun
is close from there, right?

162
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,417
Take him to the apartment--

163
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,377
Stop the car and get out.

164
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,268
Get out. You're not getting out?

165
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,503
Give me the key!

166
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,965
Hey, you little mutt.
Get your head on straight!

167
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,176
You'll do what? You will kill who?

168
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,263
Fine, let's say you go and kill a man.

169
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,598
Then you'll clear your father's name,

170
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,810
and if someone gets in your way,
you'll kill another one.

171
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,186
Try it.

172
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,232
Are you not going to see her ever again?

173
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,403
Chae Yeong-sin.
Are you fine with not seeing her again?

174
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,540
It won't end just by killing Kim Mun-sik.

175
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,002
Let's say he went after your mom
because of you.

176
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,714
Shouldn't you find out
why he went after Chae Yeong-sin first?

177
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,841
I'll go and ask him myself.

178
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,928
If I beat the crap out of him
I'm sure he'll talk.

179
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,889
Chae Yeong-sin's mom is there too.

180
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,229
Your girl's mom is there in that house.

181
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,408
Damn it!

182
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,334
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

183
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,251
Chi-su.

184
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,420
Yeong-sin is home.

185
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,048
Does she realize what time--

186
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,884
She seems a bit strange.

187
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,347
-What?
-She doesn't seem drunk,

188
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,432
but her eyes are blank.

189
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,027
Is something wrong?

190
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,159
Yeong-sin.

191
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,121
I'm sorry, I'll clean that up later.

192
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,637
Chi-su!

193
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,181
Yeong-sin is crying!

194
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,523
What? What is it?

195
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,777
-Dad...
-Yes, what is it?

196
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,862
That jerk...

197
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,451
He's been lying to me all along.

198
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,871
Who?

199
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,749
Every single thing he said...

200
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,296
to my face was a complete lie.

201
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:44,511
I didn't know, and I trusted him
and told him everything.

202
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,931
Told him?

203
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:53,603
That big, fat jerk tricked me
from the get-go.

204
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,023
-But Dad...
-Yes?

205
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,444
I couldn't tell him.

206
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,489
I was afraid that...

207
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,910
if I told him that I knew...

208
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,248
he would just leave.

209
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,629
I was afraid I would never see him again,

210
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,798
so I couldn't tell him.

211
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,515
I can't bear not seeing him again.

212
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,269
I just can't do that.

213
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,523
What should I do?

214
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:59,544
First, Yeong-sin has a crush on two guys.

215
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,130
That's total nonsense.

216
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,050
Why would she have a crush on guys?

217
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,510
It must be the other way around.

218
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,345
I'm not making it up.

219
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,430
Yeong-sin said it herself.

220
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,890
Shut it. Move.

221
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:17,187
But you know, I think
those two guys aren't the problem.

222
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:18,939
Then?

223
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,526
You know that kid who works with her
who keeps coming?

224
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,031
-Bong-suk?
-He's the one.

225
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,158
He is what?

226
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:34,121
You know Yeong-sin
never talks about herself.

227
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,705
Yes, that's...

228
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,253
Come to think of it,
she doesn't have many friends,

229
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,755
and she never brings anyone home.

230
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,175
That's because the house
is always filled with ex-cons.

231
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,304
Anyway, she tells him everything.

232
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,391
To Bong-suk?

233
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,978
I saw it with my own eyes
and heard it with my own ears.

234
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:02,691
She tells that idiot
what she doesn't tell you or me.

235
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,362
So, I'm sure he's the one.

236
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:12,868
Yes?

237
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,129
Here, drink this.

238
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,014
I won't tell you to eat.

239
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,975
You get an upset stomach
if you eat when you're upset.

240
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,727
I'm not crying anymore.

241
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,188
Drink it and go to sleep.

242
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,858
Dad.

243
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,152
Yes?

244
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,112
Why me?

245
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,239
It's weird.

246
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,950
To be honest...

247
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,455
It's difficult for people to like me.

248
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,624
You thought that was weird?

249
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:05,879
There must have been
plenty of kids at the orphanage

250
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,590
who were prettier,
younger, and nicer than I was.

251
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,970
You said I couldn't talk
and I wouldn't listen.

252
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,598
That wasn't all.

253
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:22,187
If we tried to bathe you,
you would bite us.

254
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,733
You would go into the basement
or the garage and stay there all day.

255
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,987
And you were always filthy
and stank like crazy.

256
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,781
So, why did you bring me home?

257
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,201
I didn't bring you home.

258
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,162
-You did.
-I just waited.

259
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,415
I waited and you came.

260
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,461
-I did?
-You came next to me...

261
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,508
and you held my hand first.

262
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,927
That's how we came home together.

263
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,054
You...

264
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,350
just waited?

265
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,393
Yes.

266
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,231
You know, I could have waited longer...

267
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,818
but you came sooner than I had expected.

268
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,072
You know...

269
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,783
you were never very persistent.

270
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,137
Honey.

271
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,977
Don't cry. You're breaking my heart.

272
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,481
I'm almost done crying.

273
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,424
Hello, sir.

274
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,551
Thank you for coming all the way...

275
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,183
I wanted to lock him up in a basement
at first.

276
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,144
But he caused a ruckus,
saying that he didn't like it there.

277
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,146
So we brought him here.

278
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,585
-This guy is Healer?
-We are certain, sir.

279
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,214
But he insisted
that he was a close friend of yours.

280
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,591
That's why we sent you
his photo, just in case.

281
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,635
Will you please leave us alone?

282
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,680
No, that is very dangerous.

283
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,515
We are close friends,

284
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,308
so I'll be fine.

285
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,020
Yes, sir.

286
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,856
Wait outside.

287
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,699
It's been a long time.

288
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,747
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to shake your hand.

289
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,425
You told those guys that you're Healer?

290
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:24,679
It was so easy to take your money
until now.

291
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,931
You were the one who broke into my house?

292
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,434
Don't you want to continue
working together?

293
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,562
I'll give you a 10% special discount
since we're friends.

294
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,279
-It isn't you.
-Is Myeong-hui still sleeping?

295
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,365
How many hours a day does she sleep now?

296
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,346
-Yeong-jae.
-You're alive. Kim Mun-sik.

297
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,141
Hey. When were you released?

298
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,895
I'm sorry that we never went to visit.

299
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,523
How's Myeong-hui?

300
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,735
She's sleeping.

301
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,112
She sleeps more than 20 hours a day.

302
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,949
Her husband died, and so did her daughter.

303
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,659
I'm sure she doesn't want to wake up.

304
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,287
But she has stabilized quite a bit now.

305
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,041
-The tests--
-I have been out of prison for a while.

306
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,669
Two months? Maybe longer?

307
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,172
Why didn't you call sooner?

308
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,926
Because I was too suspicious of you.

309
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,555
Mun-sik, think about it.

310
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,351
One morning, three bears go hunting.

311
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,605
But two of them die and one lives.

312
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:02,193
And the bear that lives
suddenly sells his junkyard

313
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,779
and becomes the...

314
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,491
head of planning or something like that
at a strange newspaper company.

315
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,368
Don't make up stories in your head.

316
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,122
You were in prison, so you don't know
how the world has changed.

317
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,500
Listen to what I have to say first.

318
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,920
How did a bear become
the head of planning?

319
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,757
It's really strange, isn't it?

320
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:30,722
Bears should live in the woods,
don't you think?

321
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,687
Jun-seok's son came to see me.

322
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,023
He wanted to know about his dad.

323
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,526
If a child asks, an adult should answer.

324
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,447
Kids can't understand
what sacrifices we had to make

325
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,741
to create this world we live in today.

326
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:56,039
The word sacrifice
is being abused right there.

327
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,040
Yeong-jae.

328
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:02,170
I won't permit the peace
in this world that we protected...

329
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,092
to be broken so easily.

330
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,556
We call people like that impurities.

331
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,980
Why must you live
as an impurity all your life?

332
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,231
Why you...

333
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,401
Because we are bears.

334
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,696
Are you working with my brother, Mun-ho...

335
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,117
to dig up something
that happened 20 years ago?

336
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,871
Were you the ones who told
Jun-seok's son about him?

337
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,041
If two papa bears died,
then two mama bears

338
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,543
and two baby bears remain.

339
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,671
That kid hurt Myeong-hui.

340
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:48,049
You need all three bears for the song.

341
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:54,263
Once upon a time, there lived three bears

342
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:58,685
Papa bear, mama bear, and baby bear

343
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,570
I'm very angry right now.

344
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,574
Don't make me angry.

345
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,786
Mun-sik, may I ask you something?

346
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,456
-What is it?
-Was it just Gil-han and Jun-seok?

347
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,334
You have killed more people, haven't you?

348
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,842
But don't even think
about touching the baby bears.

349
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,511
I'll protect them.

350
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,389
Why? Well...

351
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,684
Because I'm the papa bears' friend.

352
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,195
What are you doing here?

353
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,658
-Well, I'm...
-We're working right now.

354
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:56,951
Yes, sir.

355
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,162
We're following up on a report.

356
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,496
What report?

357
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,458
That someone was abducted
and brought here.

358
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,801
There are detectives downstairs.

359
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,764
You can't be found here,
so you should go out through the back.

360
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,809
-See you later, Yeong-jae.
-I'll think about it.

361
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,436
This way.

362
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,106
Once upon a time, there lived three bears

363
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,526
Papa bear, mama bear, and baby bear

364
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,863
Papa bear was fat

365
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,783
Mama bear was thin

366
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,161
Baby bear was so, so cute

367
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,746
Good little bear

368
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,582
Don't you need a search warrant
or something?

369
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,460
No we don't, since this is an emergency.

370
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,384
You abducted someone
from the garage at Seongmin Mall.

371
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,430
You don't like that term?
How about "took by force" then?

372
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,890
I don't know what you mean.

373
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,642
Excuse me, Detective.

374
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,977
Please save me.

375
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,460
Mom, someone is watching you.

376
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,130
How well can you act?

377
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,966
How about a mom
who saw her son after ten years?

378
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,930
I should just act happy to see you, right?

379
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,475
That's easy. Very easy.

380
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,905
Let's order something else.
What do you like?

381
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,574
I can't stay long.

382
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,117
Really?

383
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,536
But are you okay?

384
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,915
How did you know my size?

385
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,458
Look.

386
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,591
I told you that I won't come see you
if you cry.

387
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,678
I'm not crying. See?

388
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,515
I'm sorry about everything.

389
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,185
I never gave you my number.

390
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,064
I called whenever I wanted,
and told you not to ask any questions.

391
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,442
It's fine.

392
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,029
That was all I could do for you.

393
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,157
But I won't even be able to
call you for a while.

394
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,118
That's the only way you'll be safe.

395
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,703
You may not understand, but...

396
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,458
I understand. I know.

397
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:06,140
I came to see you one last time.

398
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:07,808
Okay.

399
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,729
-So, don't ask me for my number.
-I won't.

400
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,360
Have a happy life
with your new husband and new son.

401
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,154
I prefer you forgetting
all about me anyway.

402
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,492
Thanks to you abandoning me,
I was able to find my place.

403
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,493
So, let's call it even.

404
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,994
I'm sorry, Jeong-hu.

405
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,833
We won't see each other again
even by chance.

406
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,086
I'm leaving the country
as soon as I'm done.

407
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,047
I'll never return to this country.

408
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,590
That's all I have to say.

409
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,301
Let's say goodbye here.

410
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,346
I'm done being your son.

411
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,894
Take care of yourself.

412
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,409
I found you.

413
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,036
Jeong-hu.

414
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,496
You still remember my name?

415
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,084
Why aren't you bundled up?
Aren't you cold?

416
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,726
-Ouch!
-Don't make my mom cry!

417
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,895
It's okay. Don't do that.

418
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,189
Don't do that to your brother.

419
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,900
Is that your son, Mom?

420
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,861
Do you live with him?

421
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,863
Yes.

422
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,745
You can live with him...

423
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,290
But why not with me?

424
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,959
I'm sorry, Jeong-hu.

425
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,461
Stop that!

426
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,881
Stop crying.

427
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,885
How can we talk if you cry like that?

428
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,935
It was my fault.

429
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,561
What?

430
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:02,942
Your mom didn't even want to meet me,
but I couldn't live without her.

431
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,444
-So, I forced--
-What are you babbling about?

432
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,323
Your mom talked
about you every day. It's true.

433
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,244
Every time she talked
about you, she would cry.

434
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,245
But...

435
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,623
It was my fault.

436
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,555
-Mister.
-Yes?

437
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,433
Does Mom cry all the time like that?

438
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,896
All the time.

439
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,315
Don't let her cry. It's annoying.

440
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,444
I won't. I'm sorry.

441
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,321
-Give me that.
-What?

442
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,739
I'm cold. Give me that jacket.

443
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,993
They'll back off now.

444
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:40,748
They went after your mom to see
whether or not you were Healer.

445
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,667
My brother Mun-sik...

446
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,586
wouldn't sink that low.

447
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,547
I see. So...

448
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,425
So if he's not the person to sink that low

449
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,221
why did he use my mom as bait
and try to kill Yeong-sin?

450
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,808
Do you want some coffee?

451
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,940
Why did Kim Mun-sik try to kill Yeong-sin?

452
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,484
I came all the way here to ask you that,

453
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,278
so please answer me.

454
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,906
It wasn't Mun-sik.
There is someone called Boss.

455
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,367
Who on earth is that?

456
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,118
The person we'll have to fight.

457
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,703
"We"?

458
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,164
Who do you mean by, "we"?

459
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,917
You and I, and probably Yeong-sin.

460
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,044
Stop talking nonsense.

461
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,549
Tell me who this Boss person is.

462
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,093
All I know is that people call him Boss.

463
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,553
I don't know his name or face.

464
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:40,558
Then what exactly do you know
about him, Reporter Kim Mun-ho?

465
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,851
I probably know where and how to fight.

466
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:49,817
Where and how to fight? Do you mean
saying on the air that he's a bad guy?

467
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,734
Exactly.

468
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,404
And then what happens?

469
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,324
Wouldn't he stop doing bad things anymore?

470
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,953
I don't care whether
they do bad things or not.

471
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,205
This is what I am going to do.

472
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:08,043
Firstly, find out who that Boss is.

473
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,503
And secondly,

474
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,382
find out if he has
my dad's police records.

475
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:17,928
Most dirty scumbags
like to collect records on others.

476
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,056
There's a 50% probability. And thirdly,

477
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:26,020
make sure he never messes with
Yeong-sin again.

478
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,189
There's no use.

479
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,235
If you kill that Boss,
another Boss will rise up.

480
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,237
We can think about that later on.

481
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,076
She's early.

482
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,497
-Who?
-The girl I like.

483
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,541
Would you let her in?

484
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,421
What the...

485
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,184
Yeong-sin.

486
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,603
Hey, Bong-su.

487
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,565
Why are you here? I mean...

488
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,653
Why are you at your boss's apartment...

489
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:20,324
Seriously, can we just spend Sunday
like a normal person...

490
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,535
What the?

491
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,955
The cameraman is here too. How...

492
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,041
Mun-ho, we're here!

493
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,970
Thank you for agreeing
to do the interview.

494
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,933
Not at all. I was surprised
you have a good grasp of the story.

495
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,435
How did you come up
with interviewing me first?

496
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,562
You're the easiest.

497
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,231
The easiest?

498
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,191
That was a joke.

499
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,360
Hello, Mun-ho.

500
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,028
Hey, you came too?

501
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,122
Here. Take some medicine and sleep.

502
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:10,999
What?

503
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,127
I don't want to take the medicine.

504
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,878
I'm going to stay awake.

505
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,005
Dr. Jo said you need to rest.

506
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,715
Stop trying to put me to sleep.

507
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,134
You're ill.

508
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,677
I'm fine being ill.

509
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,096
I just want to think.

510
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,231
Think about what?

511
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,316
It's been so long
since I have thought about something.

512
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,860
Where should I start?

513
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,905
For example, my hospital bill?

514
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,949
What hospital bill?

515
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,242
It was 22 years ago.

516
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,704
I was hospitalized
for over a year after the accident.

517
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,706
I had several surgeries too.

518
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,792
And I was always in a VIP suite.

519
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,087
-So?
-Where did you get...

520
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,381
all that money?

521
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,468
I told you.

522
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,803
I sold the junkyard.

523
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,015
"How much could you have gotten
for your junkyard?

524
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,267
How much was my hospital bill?"

525
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,395
I'm doing the math.

526
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,814
Adding and subtracting.
It's very basic math.

527
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:21,111
You seem very anxious
ever since you saw Jun-seok's son.

528
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,905
So...

529
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,577
I said, I'm doing the math right now.

530
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:42,132
According to our investigation,
until 1992,

531
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,093
Kim Mun-sik operated a small junkyard.

532
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,637
That was his only asset.

533
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,388
That is correct.

534
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,725
Then in spring of 1992,
he sold that junkyard

535
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,854
and was hired in summer
as head of planning of Jeil News.

536
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,940
And every year, he kept being promoted.

537
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,818
He became the president of Jeil News
within five years.

538
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,488
That is a bit difficult to understand.

539
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,240
He wasn't officially recruited.

540
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,075
He was actually specially appointed.

541
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,744
How could he rise
to president in five years?

542
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:11,954
I was shocked too.

543
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:15,499
He had guests over almost daily back then.

544
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:20,003
From what I recall, most of the guests
weren't related to the newspaper industry.

545
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,380
From other industries?

546
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:25,509
The company I recall most clearly
is Omega Investments.

547
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,094
Omega Investments?

548
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,346
Jeil News was on the brink of bankruptcy.

549
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,515
Omega bought up most of the shares.

550
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,644
And shortly after, my brother Kim Mun-sik
became its president.

551
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,021
Interesting, isn't it?

552
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,240
I haven't slept for over 38 hours now.

553
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,411
I need to hack the immigration database
and create your entry documents.

554
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,914
Why did you have to choose Russia
of all countries?

555
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,167
I don't understand a thing.

556
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:44,296
And I need to watch
Kim Mun-sik and Sang-su's boys.

557
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,341
So, Master is at the police station?

558
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,717
What's going on? Was he arrested?

559
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,386
Don't worry.

560
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,763
Don't you know him by now?

561
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,849
He'll walk out of there
by tomorrow morning.

562
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,685
Master was in prison for over ten years.

563
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,146
He can't go back.

564
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,358
Should I go in and break him out?

565
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,778
Be quiet. You're giving me a headache!

566
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,863
Wait, Ms. Jo. Wait...

567
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,580
What do you think?

568
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:25,170
If you would share your knowledge...

569
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,296
What's so funny?

570
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,177
These are documents
I have gathered on Jeil News' funds

571
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,137
and these are on Samhan Industries.

572
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,056
Look for similarities between them.

573
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,557
I'll look through them.

574
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,518
You can finish by tonight, right?

575
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,019
Tonight...

576
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,437
Of course. Not a problem.

577
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,355
I...

578
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,234
Actually, I have plans tonight...

579
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,276
-Jong-su.
-Yes?

580
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,237
You get on it too.
We don't have much time.

581
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,199
Okay, then. Should we go to the office?

582
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,576
The office is cold at night.

583
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,786
Let's go to my house.

584
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,204
That sounds good.

585
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,164
Then will you feed me dinner?

586
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,249
Can you wash the dishes?

587
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,085
I was on kitchen duty in the army.

588
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,044
Perfect.

589
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,964
I can cook, but I'm not good
at doing the dishes.

590
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,184
-Hey.
-These are my colleagues.

591
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,228
This is my dad and his friend.

592
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,897
Hello, I'm Lee Jong-su.

593
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,691
I'm sorry for troubling you.

594
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,234
Welcome.

595
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,278
We have to work all night,
so I brought them here.

596
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,113
Can we use your office, Dad?

597
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,699
What? Sure, use it. Go ahead.

598
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:39,327
It's my first time meeting you,
so I should have brought a cake--

599
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,079
We're overflowing with cakes.

600
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,168
Right. But anyway,
the cafe looks very nice.

601
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,128
The air in here feels so...

602
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,422
Thanks.

603
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,801
We don't have time. Let's go.

604
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,266
Hold on.

605
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,518
-You're back.
-Yes.

606
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,729
Your name is Bong-suk...

607
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,314
I mean, Bong-su, right?

608
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,691
Yes, I'm Bong-su.

609
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:18,283
So, one of those two guys
made my Yeong-sin cry?

610
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,787
Up until a moment ago,
my vote was with Bong-suk.

611
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,829
But now...

612
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,458
What?

613
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,585
Who is it?

614
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,382
Omega Investments
reached out to several companies.

615
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,343
-Let me see.
-Take a look.

616
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,055
In 1997, it was Daeil Machinery.

617
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:44,142
In 1999, it was Donggu Chemicals,
and now here.

618
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,606
Jeil News is related to many companies.

619
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,755
East or west?

620
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,633
-What?
-Which one?

621
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,390
East.

622
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,725
Okay, then.

623
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,491
I'll talk to you side by side
for one minute.

624
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,539
What was west?

625
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,126
A hug for ten seconds.

626
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,003
I change my answer.

627
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,757
Good. You laughed.

628
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,260
What?

629
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,387
I thought you were mad at me.

630
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,139
You wouldn't look at me.

631
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,101
I wasn't angry.

632
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,103
I was holding back.

633
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,106
-Holding back?
-Yes.

634
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,109
Holding back my desire
to hold hands with you.

635
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:25,076
I want to hug and talk all night long.

636
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,372
And I want to kiss.

637
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,589
I want to do all that with him,
but I'm holding back.

638
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,594
And holding back so much
is getting me angry.

639
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,726
What?

640
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,824
He still won't come. That jerk.

641
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,830
He must have a good reason.

642
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,625
I know.

643
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,962
I think so too.

644
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,214
You do?

645
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,341
Yes.

646
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,011
But he's still such a jerk, isn't he?

647
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,140
Yes.

648
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,520
I'll wait.

649
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,897
I'll wait, but...

650
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,150
it makes me very angry.

651
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,698
I know.

652
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,123
THE SUCCESS STORY OF JEIL NEWS

653
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,624
PRESIDENT KIM MUN-SIK

654
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,784
Have you eaten?

655
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,203
Enjoy your breakfast.

656
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,997
The radish kimchi tastes good.

657
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,256
Name, Ki Yeong-jae.

658
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,468
Imprisoned for 11 years and 2 months
for anti-government statements.

659
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,222
Released in February 1993.

660
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,349
Current address is Hyeonnam-myeon.

661
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:37,310
Hyeonnam-myeon? Where is that?

662
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:41,648
-In Gangwon-do, YangYang.
-I see, Gangwon-do is nice.

663
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,238
Do you know...

664
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,408
the name, Jo Min-ja?

665
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,369
It sounds like a woman's name.

666
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,499
She visited you in prison five times.

667
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,251
You have to remember her.

668
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,670
Jo Min-ja.

669
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:08,174
She was a detective on the cyber team
and was my direct superior.

670
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,428
I really liked her.

671
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,140
So, you liked her.

672
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,895
Her hacking skills were out of this world.

673
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,898
I learned a lot from her.

674
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:28,903
But something happened in the parking lot
yesterday that got me thinking.

675
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,906
It was the hacking skill
that I learned so hard

676
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,491
through extensive training from her.

677
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,911
It was her exact pattern.

678
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,638
-Detective.
-Yes?

679
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,975
I think I'll have to turn...

680
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,645
myself in.

681
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,397
Turn yourself in?

682
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,523
To be honest,

683
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,776
I am Healer.

684
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:14,657
What is it?

685
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,367
Something is not right.

686
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,328
What is?

687
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,749
An hour ago, one of Kim Mun-sik's
crazy thugs met with someone.

688
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,042
So?

689
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:29,088
He looked familiar,
so it was bugging me the entire hour.

690
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,965
Get to the point. What is it?

691
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,343
He's one of Yoon Dong-won's men.

692
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,678
Darn it.

693
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,850
I became Healer a year
after being released from prison.

694
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:46,231
The name Healer was the name of a magazine
my friends and I created in high school.

695
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,275
It sounded cool. "Healer."

696
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,738
You must have partnered up with a hacker.

697
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,073
I did.

698
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:59,452
But we didn't know
each other's name or face.

699
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,204
That's how this business is.

700
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,455
What was your first job?

701
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:06,543
Can't I start with my most recent job?

702
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,297
I don't have much time.

703
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,802
CHOI MYEONG-HUI HAD TO GIVE UP
HER DREAM OF BECOMING A JOURNALIST

704
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,692
What was your most recent job?

705
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:34,362
You know the owner
of Jeil News, Kim Mun-sik?

706
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,365
He was my client.

707
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,867
Do you know Ko Seong-cheol?

708
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,078
He came from L.A.

709
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,456
-You know Hwang Je-guk?
-I do.

710
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,961
I emptied out his safe.

711
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,339
He didn't commit suicide, did he?

712
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,137
Look, Ki Yeong-jae.

713
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,806
I told you.

714
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,309
I don't have much time.

715
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,319
Ki Yeong-jae!

716
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:15,862
Ki Yeong-jae!

717
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,741
Hey!

718
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,786
Do you remember Ki Yeong-jae?

719
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,372
I'll take over now.

720
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,749
You want to see Kim Mun-sik?

721
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,627
I want to meet his wife.

722
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,880
Tell me what I'm supposed to do!

723
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,799
For the past 20 years,

724
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,552
I couldn't do anything either
and it was killing me!

725
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,221
Everyone says you're brave,

726
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,057
but you always spare yourself
during a fight.

727
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,852
Is he okay?

728
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,479
Where is he? Please.
