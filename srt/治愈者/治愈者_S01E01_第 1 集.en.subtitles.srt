1
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,462
Look.

2
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,256
I have to admit that you are sexy.

3
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,511
I also admit that you are quite resilient.

4
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,055
However...

5
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,100
what is with that outfit?

6
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,269
You're way too covered up.

7
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,730
Goodness.

8
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,198
Why can't I choose an outfit that I want?

9
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,159
If I'd created this,
I would've put that in first.

10
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,079
Number one, bikinis,
number two, belly-dancer costume,

11
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,623
number three,
white lace French maid outfit.

12
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:08,211
And number four, Playboy bunny costume.

13
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,172
MS. JO

14
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,216
Good, a little more.

15
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,355
Why aren't you answering?

16
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,773
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

17
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,901
I told you not to barge in like that!

18
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,029
I told you not to screen my calls.
I hate you.

19
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
My gosh.

20
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,157
We have a job!

21
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,995
-What is it?
-A totally simple job.

22
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,788
-When?
-Right now.

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,501
You sound suspicious.

24
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,003
Why do you say that?

25
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,548
Nothing you call "simple"
has been actually simple.

26
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,217
But you just said the job
is a totally simple one.

27
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,177
It's totally suspicious.

28
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,722
Meet someone,
receive something, and confirm deposit.

29
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,639
Job done!

30
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,975
How simple is that?

31
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,318
I have a dream.

32
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,655
Two and a half hours by speedboat
from the Panama Canal.

33
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,367
A deserted island
with dense forest and natural spring water

34
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,995
located in the middle of the bluest ocean.

35
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,789
This island is my dream.

36
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,639
There's one camera
facing exit number three.

37
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,015
Hold on.

38
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,478
Got you.

39
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,117
I took care of that one.

40
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,245
How do I get to Gayang station?

41
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,206
Does he want to meet me here?

42
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,210
He must think it would be safer
in a crowded place.

43
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,003
-By the way, Ms. Jo.
-What?

44
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,131
How much are we getting paid for this?

45
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,508
Why?

46
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,012
There's one guy sitting over there,

47
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,349
and one more guy here.

48
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,143
Also this guy over here...

49
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,397
I already see four of them.

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,399
They are all wearing
the same Bluetooth device.

51
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,527
What's going on? Are they the police?

52
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,156
Did I just walk into a trap?

53
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,159
They're probably not the police.

54
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,455
The police don't have money
for that top-notch gear.

55
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,040
They aren't the police.

56
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,460
Look.

57
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,798
Even with a bulk discount,
each unit costs over 300,000 won.

58
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,758
They're definitely not the police.

59
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,345
So, how much are we getting paid for this?

60
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,264
Five million won.

61
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,932
I'm out.

62
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,726
I took payment upfront.

63
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,562
That would only leave me 2.5 million won.

64
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,397
The pay is not worth the risk.

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,525
It's actually five million won each.
You and me, equally.

66
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,069
This is our first job this month.

67
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,781
You know that this business
got more competitive, right?

68
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,034
Seriously...

69
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,014
Oh, wow.

70
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,102
Her butt is...

71
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,020
My gosh.

72
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,566
She's so pretty.

73
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,032
Great work!

74
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,368
Got it. Back to you.

75
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,163
Oh, my goodness.

76
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,584
DELETE CALL HISTORY

77
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,379
Oh, wow.

78
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,466
Damn it.

79
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,552
Wait, excuse me...

80
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,185
120 PHOTOS OF SEXY ASIAN AND WESTERN GIRLS

81
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,273
Let's see what I have.

82
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,401
Let's see. "Agency."

83
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,238
What agency do you work for?

84
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,747
Hello? This is Double S Guard.

85
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,334
-What? Where?
-It's Double S.

86
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,961
They are Sang-su's guys.

87
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,879
Are you serious?

88
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,339
They're your rivals.

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,218
Look, no matter how well you play
baseball in your neighborhood,

90
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,387
you're no rival to a major league star.

91
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,141
One out of four regulars of ours
switched to them in the past three months.

92
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:18,479
When it comes to the scale of resources,
we are no match for them.

93
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,731
Whatever. When is the client arriving?

94
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,818
In 12 seconds.
He's in the third car from the front.

95
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,081
So, what does he look like?

96
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,334
Name, Ko Seong-cheol. Age, 41.

97
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:57,185
NAME: KO SEONG-CHEOL
A PERMANENT RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

98
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,769
Okay, bingo.

99
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,738
You're here for Healer, right?

100
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,220
SEO JEONG-HU (CODE NAME: HEALER)
PROFESSION: COURIER

101
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,472
MONTHLY INCOME: VARIES
BETWEEN ZERO TO SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION

102
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,183
GOAL: PURCHASING A DESERTED ISLAND
(SAVED 64% OF THE TARGET AMOUNT)

103
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,983
Gosh.

104
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

105
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,001
This elevator is going up.

106
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,630
"Suite 703"? That's my house.

107
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,340
-I'll take this.
-Oh, okay.

108
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,677
Seventh floor.

109
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,053
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

110
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,472
Door is closing.

111
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,081
-Who is it?
-Package delivery.

112
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,958
Just leave it at the door.

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,297
I have mail for you too.
It looks like a court subpoena.

114
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,382
It's registered mail,
so you need to sign for it.

115
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,095
Or would you rather pick it up
at the post office?

116
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,521
I'll take it.

117
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,815
You have to sign there.

118
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,827
What's wrong?

119
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,748
I'm fine. I just have a heart condition.

120
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,751
Oh, right.

121
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,131
I need to take my pills.
Would you get me some water?

122
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,175
Oh, my goodness.

123
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,469
Give me a minute.

124
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,699
Are you okay?

125
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,368
I'm okay.

126
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,335
I feel much better now. Thank you.

127
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,753
What about my mail?

128
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,713
I already signed it.

129
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,800
Right.

130
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,135
You're Ms. Lee Jeong-eun, correct?

131
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,389
Look at me closely.

132
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,182
Don't you know...

133
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,017
who I am?

134
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,018
You are not?

135
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,021
That's weird. Something's not right.

136
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,525
Hey! You!

137
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,904
Doesn't Oh Seon-jeong
live alone in that apartment?

138
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,781
But I saw a pair of men's shoes in there.

139
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,242
I can tell they are at least size 270
even at a glance.

140
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,037
Come on, I even took a picture of it.

141
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,706
Simply speaking,
I've got an exclusive scoop.

142
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,126
Hang on a minute.

143
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,879
Men's shoes are found
in top star Oh Seon-jeong's apartment...

144
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,549
That's not good enough.
We need something juicy.

145
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,093
I'm certain those were
Lee Jun-bin's shoes!

146
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,011
"An all-night stakeout
results in an exclusive scoop!

147
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,806
Signs of Lee spending time
in Oh's apartment."

148
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,225
That's still not good enough.

149
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,478
Look, if you forced yourself
into the apartment,

150
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,772
you should've gotten an interview
at least.

151
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,316
You should've taken a picture
of his clothes on the couch

152
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,194
or something like that
instead of his shoes.

153
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,572
And if I get charged with trespassing,

154
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,282
will you pay for my legal fees?

155
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,242
Then I'll barge into her place right now.

156
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,786
Just have some patience.

157
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,415
I'll search the entire building
and find Lee Jun-bin's car.

158
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,084
The license plate number of his car
is 3389.

159
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,170
His agent's is 5425.

160
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,882
My instinct as a reporter is telling me
that one of them is here--

161
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,261
That little punk!

162
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,805
What? What is it?

163
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,265
Did Lee Jun-bin show up?

164
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,268
Hey, Yeong-sin. Hey--

165
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,561
Wait...

166
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,065
How dare she treats her boss like this?

167
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,068
She calls me and hangs up on me
whenever she wants.

168
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,989
She even speaks informally now and then.

169
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,200
What is with her?

170
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,870
I'll teach you some manners
your mom failed to teach you.

171
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,664
-Hey, you!
-You idiot!

172
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,002
What?

173
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,922
You guys are chasing him on the subway?

174
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,550
How many of you do I have to beat up
to make you listen?

175
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,594
What?

176
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,471
Healer?

177
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,890
You think it's him?

178
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,061
Are you sure it's Healer?

179
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,189
What does he look like?

180
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,110
I gave you guys a picture of him!

181
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,780
Compare it to him. Are you sure it's him?

182
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,783
Stop babbling, you idiot!

183
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,910
Not the face, look at his figure!

184
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,038
His build, the overall look
or something like that!

185
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,582
It's similar?

186
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,961
Hold on.

187
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,049
Since they already know
that we are after him, get them both.

188
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,928
Ko Seong-cheol will talk
after we break a few of his fingers.

189
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,597
And make sure to bring Healer to me.

190
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,975
I want to unmask him.

191
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,770
That little prick. I'm going to...

192
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,943
Where are you?

193
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,320
Which subway station?

194
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,710
CHAE YEONG-SIN

195
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,170
PROFESSION: REPORTER
AT AN ONLINE NEWS NETWORK

196
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,594
Healer.

197
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,429
Is this really Healer?

198
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,514
This guy?

199
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,725
Seriously?

200
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,143
MONTHLY INCOME: AROUND 1.5 MILLION WON

201
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,686
GOAL: BECOMING A REPORTER LIKE KIM MUN-HO

202
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,786
It's Reporter Kim Mun-ho!

203
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,915
This is crazy.

204
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,833
-Isn't that Kim Mun-ho?
-Reporter Kim Mun-ho is here.

205
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,877
I think he will cover this story.

206
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,756
Doors to Samhan Industries,
where labor negotiations are underway,

207
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,717
-are shut tight at this moment.
-Mun-ho, here is the report.

208
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,219
-The negotiation process...
-It appears

209
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,596
the layoffs will proceed as planned,

210
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,058
and they won't provide compensation
for the laid-off workers.

211
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,268
Then which of the union's demands
did they accept?

212
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,980
They won't press charges
against the illegal laborers

213
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,399
other than the leaders
that led the strike.

214
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,904
Please help the families of the workers
of Samhan Industries!

215
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,699
-Help them!
-Help them!

216
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:55,704
-The families of the workers are dying!
-Where are you going?

217
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,667
-They're dying!
-They're dying!

218
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,794
-Samhan Industries--
-I'm Kim Mun-ho of ABS.

219
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,504
Hello. Good day, sir.

220
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,923
Please help us.

221
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,052
Our children and husbands are dying
in hopelessness.

222
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,807
Please save us.
We need support from people.

223
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,436
What are you doing?

224
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,441
You're famous, aren't you?
I've seen you before.

225
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,235
You're a famous reporter, right?

226
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,569
Do you have anything to say to me?

227
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,656
My son is Shin Yeong-cheol.

228
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,742
He used to be
in Samhan's Maintenance Department.

229
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,871
He set himself on fire
and is in the hospital now.

230
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,581
I've heard.

231
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,208
I don't know why he did that.

232
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,795
He wouldn't have done that
without good reason to do so.

233
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,841
So I wanted to ask the CEO
about what really happened,

234
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,801
but they won't even let me in.

235
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:55,097
Please help my son. Please...

236
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,101
My poor son. What should I do?

237
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,062
Please help my son. Please.

238
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,814
-Manager Kang.
-Yes? What?

239
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,109
-Attend the press conference yourself.
-Please help my son.

240
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,738
What do you mean?

241
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,364
-Jong-su.
-Yes?

242
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,282
Come with me.

243
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,076
-What? But...
-Hey, Mun-ho.

244
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,786
Mun-ho!

245
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,706
Look! The door is opening! Mun-ho!

246
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,376
This is for tonight's news.
We need to shoot this!

247
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,669
Mun-ho!

248
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,213
Gosh.

249
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,062
KIM MUN-HO
PROFESSION: RENOWNED REPORTER

250
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,065
MONTHLY INCOME: TOO MUCH TO CALCULATE

251
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,651
GOAL: ENDURING EACH DAY AND FIND THE CHILD

252
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,575
I'm Kim Mun-ho from ABS.

253
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,952
May I have a word with you?

254
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,047
Thank you.

255
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,938
My name is Kim Mun-ho.

256
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,191
How are you holding up?

257
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,528
I was hoping to interview you.

258
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,198
Well, he can't speak.

259
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,159
They said his throat is burnt too.

260
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,453
He can't speak at the moment.

261
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,834
Okay.

262
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,088
He can only move his right hand,

263
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,675
so he writes when he has something to say.

264
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,012
He wrote something
he wanted to show to the reporters.

265
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,099
He wrote it a while ago,

266
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,853
but no one came until now.

267
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,779
Please tell our story.

268
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:21,118
No one has listened to us.

269
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,080
The company's claim
about facing financial difficulties

270
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,082
is a total lie.

271
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,349
I'm sorry that I came so late.

272
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,583
-What is the next stop?
-Pardon?

273
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,086
How's the status?

274
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,050
The status at the next stop is actually...

275
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,389
not good.

276
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,684
Sang-su's boys must have been waiting.

277
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,774
-How many are there?
-Goodness, did he send them all?

278
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,150
There's a bunch.

279
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:40,405
One, two, four, seven and nine.

280
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,788
We're ready. He has nowhere to run.

281
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,541
You said this is a five-million-won job.

282
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,502
And yet, he sent all his boys?

283
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,045
How much are they getting paid?

284
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,215
Ms. Jo, are you losing your touch
in this business?

285
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,258
Excuse me.

286
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,886
Can you control this train?

287
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,596
You're on line number nine, right?

288
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,891
I think that's the newest model.
It should be an automated train.

289
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,731
-Hey, mister.
-Yes?

290
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,818
I think they're after you.

291
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,574
What should we do? This is bad.

292
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,328
-Trust me from now on.
-What?

293
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,999
Trust me, no matter what.

294
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
I'm Healer.

295
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,294
I'll help you out.

296
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,892
All right, on the count of three,
we will jump off the train.

297
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,770
Jump off the train?

298
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,023
One.

299
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,402
Two.

300
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,582
-Okay now.
-Is there an accident?

301
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,624
Three.

302
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,588
What the...

303
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,839
Three!

304
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,180
-Seriously?
-Oh, no. My bad.

305
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,070
What's going on?

306
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,654
-The item.
-What?

307
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,866
Give me the item.
I need to check if it's authentic.

308
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,453
Don't you know who I am?

309
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,165
I have a reputation
for always sticking to the contract.

310
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,458
I'm that Healer.

311
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,628
Make the deposit
after confirming the item.

312
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,214
Those were the terms of the contract,
so hand it over.

313
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,634
I will also confirm the deposit for you.

314
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,846
Help me get away from them first.

315
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,973
I'll give it to you afterward.

316
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:33,161
Even if they catch you,
I doubt they will really kill...

317
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,748
Well, maybe they will.

318
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,291
Let's run first.

319
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,293
You don't know what this is, do you?

320
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,837
Look, mister. I mean, sir.

321
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,672
Don't tell me what it is.

322
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,048
They will kill me.

323
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,511
I'm going to get killed,
so please save me first.

324
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,389
-Gosh. Ms. Jo.
-Yes?

325
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,767
Get rid of that train. It's too bright.

326
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,855
You want me to get rid of the train?
Then, I shall.

327
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,316
I'm telling you,
there is nothing wrong with the train.

328
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,402
Is something wrong at the control station?

329
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,028
Oh, my goodness.

330
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,953
Where did they go?

331
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,830
Take out your flashlights!

332
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,669
Where did they go? Get them!

333
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,986
When is the next train coming?

334
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,488
In two minutes and ten seconds
from the opposite side.

335
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,908
How many are left?
Can you finish before then?

336
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,243
What's going on?

337
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,661
Get them!

338
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,205
Two minutes and three seconds.

339
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,667
No matter how hard I think about it,
the pay is not good enough.

340
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,003
Don't break your glasses.
We don't have a spare.

341
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,172
Seriously?

342
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,065
One minute and twenty seconds.

343
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,324
One minute.

344
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,378
Fifty seconds.

345
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,631
Hold on.

346
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,049
Let's call a ceasefire.

347
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,845
First of all, let's put him off the track.

348
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,889
And then we need to get away...

349
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,392
Hey, wait! Wait, you idiot.

350
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,271
-Let's take a break, all right?
-I will kill you.

351
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,445
Are you there?

352
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,821
Healer?

353
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,742
Hello?

354
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,710
Only five million won for this?

355
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,713
This is seriously

356
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,049
not right.

357
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,927
Come on!

358
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,978
Our point is simple.

359
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:13,483
A former president left a quote
that's befitting this situation.

360
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,486
"How desperate must a company be
to fire people?

361
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,072
You have to understand
the company's situation.

362
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,991
Going against the decision
would only harm the organization."

363
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,452
Such wise words, don't you think?

364
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:30,625
But still, 45% of workers
of Samhan Industries will be laid off.

365
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,336
The public sentiment on the matter
will not be positive.

366
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,089
I'm sure they will criticize
the government for this,

367
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,842
so we will need a rebuttal for that.

368
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,677
Why would they blame the government?

369
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,431
The labor union
is responsible for this mess.

370
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,184
There's no logic
in your editor-in-chief's argument.

371
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,853
How can he be so incompetent?

372
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,689
Okay, this will be the premise
of our story.

373
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,318
"The union's reckless strike
and external pressure

374
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,238
have cornered the company
which has been financially struggling.

375
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,658
The union has jeopardized the jobs

376
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,953
and livelihood of workers who didn't
participate in the illegal acts."

377
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,582
Let's also mention that preventing
this kind of illegal strikes

378
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,377
will greatly benefit the economy
and improve public welfare.

379
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,130
I think that sounds good.
Let's go with that.

380
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,924
Then, I'll excuse myself now.

381
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:23,094
It's time for my wife
to take her medicine.

382
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,806
Enough is enough, Mr. Kim.

383
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,392
How can you still be so in love
with your wife?

384
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,060
I'll call again.

385
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,325
He has the item.

386
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,286
Did you confirm it?

387
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,289
Yes, I compared it thoroughly.
It is what we are looking for.

388
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,334
Someone tried to take it, right?

389
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,670
Who was behind them?

390
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,216
Well...

391
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,259
It was Mun-ho, wasn't it?

392
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:05,929
Yes.

393
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,097
That kid.

394
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,893
He should've hired better people.

395
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,104
Reporter Kim Mun-ho hired an agency
called Double S Guard.

396
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,273
They are the best in the business.

397
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,568
They have a lot of employees
and high-tech equipment.

398
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,655
Who took care of it on our end?

399
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,741
He goes by the code name Healer.

400
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,703
He is known to work alone.

401
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,332
He never discloses his identity.

402
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:39,462
Also, he never asks
the identity of his clients.

403
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,300
All I found out about him
was his code name.

404
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,137
-And?
-Pardon?

405
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,808
Have they confirmed the item?

406
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,814
He's depositing the money now.
Please check.

407
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,440
Excuse me.

408
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,901
About what I had asked...

409
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,654
Right. Ms. Jo.

410
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,657
The client added a condition.

411
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,827
He wants to return
to the United States immediately,

412
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,955
and he wants his safety guaranteed
until he boards his flight.

413
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,375
He said he will hand over the item then.

414
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,086
Please pass along this message too.

415
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:24,173
Jeil News should have no problem

416
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,635
sending me to the states.

417
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,806
That's not going to happen.

418
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,724
Why not?

419
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,851
It's our policy to keep the client's
identity anonymous.

420
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,979
Who cares about your policy?
My life is at stake.

421
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,480
Your life?

422
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,153
-Sir, you have a tendency to exaggerate--
-I'll be murdered.

423
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,281
If not, they will kidnap me

424
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,408
and put me in confinement
for the rest of my life.

425
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,076
Do you think I'm joking?

426
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,415
Ms. Jo, did you hear that?

427
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,376
1 NEW MAIL

428
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:12,972
Ko Seong-cheol seems to know
that we're from Jeil News.

429
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,684
Is that so?

430
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,811
What should we do?

431
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,023
That means the courier
knows about us as well, right?

432
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,734
What was his name again?

433
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,861
His name is Healer.

434
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,158
Healer.

435
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,037
THE ITEM THAT YOU REQUESTED

436
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,625
FROM: HEALER
TO: CLIENT1403

437
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,671
The Boss is directly connected
to this matter.

438
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,631
We must not make any mistakes.

439
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,717
No matter what it may be,

440
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,720
we'd better not leave any trace.

441
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,152
We will leave that out
and cover the press conference.

442
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,070
Okay?

443
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,419
You should've come in ten seconds sooner.
I was naked then.

444
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,298
Mun-ho.

445
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,383
That look on your face...

446
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,053
I don't want to hear it.

447
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,471
I can't hear you.

448
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,057
I'm sorry,
but we can't cover Mr. Shin's story.

449
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
-Min-jae.
-You've been told.

450
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,439
We will leave that out
and cover the press conference.

451
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,066
I edited the footage that Mr. Oh brought.

452
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,484
It's not even three minutes long.

453
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,653
I just need 2 minutes and 45 seconds.

454
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,530
Am I asking too much?

455
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,407
I'm going to get angry.

456
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,160
I made a promise.

457
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:02,665
I promised Mr. Shin
that I would cover his story on air.

458
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,001
Please help me out.

459
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:16,262
Then, we'll just comment on his situation
without the footage.

460
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,808
The anchor will ask you

461
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,936
if you've met with him.

462
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,272
Then, you will have to answer him.

463
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,776
This is all you may say. "Yes, I met him.

464
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,571
Today's labor settlement

465
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,824
can help preventing extreme situations
like this."

466
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,746
And then we will cover
the press conference, okay?

467
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,753
Cut me some slack, Mun-ho.

468
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,046
Please?

469
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,221
Camera number 10, get ready.

470
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,764
Good evening, everyone.

471
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,016
This is ABS News Week 7.

472
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,476
A little louder!

473
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,647
ABS News Week 7. One, two.

474
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,731
Yes, I hear you.

475
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,275
Testing, one, two.

476
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,237
Make sure to omit this.

477
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,488
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

478
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,793
Mun-ho.

479
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,045
Do you hear me?

480
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,508
The director is here.

481
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,428
He came to watch you.
You get what I mean, right?

482
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,392
I won't repeat myself.
Don't cause any trouble.

483
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,571
They call people like him "couriers."

484
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:57,989
"They"?

485
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,575
Who are you talking about?

486
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,036
People capable of hiring those couriers.

487
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,498
They're either rich or powerful.
You know, those influential people.

488
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,793
Pay attention to what you're doing!

489
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,964
Anyway, the most famous of them is Healer.

490
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,048
That's his code name.

491
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,302
He's legendary in that field.

492
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,305
He charges
up to several hundred million won per job.

493
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,435
So, I guess you can't pretend to hire him
in order to meet him.

494
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,644
Who knows?

495
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,105
If you lend me some money,
I might be able to.

496
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,694
If you bring home a future husband,

497
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,571
I may consider lending you
ten million won.

498
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,865
Really? Awesome.

499
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,576
Sweetie, say hi to my dad.

500
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,077
Which one is the best-looking?

501
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,497
"It's nice to meet you, father-in-law."

502
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,292
You can call me that after the wedding.

503
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:57,131
"Sir, I love Yeong-sin very much."

504
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,549
So?

505
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,553
"So, if you lend me about ten million won,

506
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,265
I'll invest it in creating
a beautiful future for her."

507
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,435
And you'll invest in meeting
that Healer guy?

508
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,480
-And if you meet him?
-I'll interview him.

509
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:16,108
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin
is awesome at interviews.

510
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,860
Stop rubbing on so much sauce.

511
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,403
It's going to get salty.

512
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,031
But this isn't important right now.

513
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,283
The jobs that Healer has taken on

514
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,744
must be related to

515
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,122
a lot of political, economic,
and social corruptions.

516
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,500
If I get all those information from him

517
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,045
and write a book using my flair for words,

518
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,505
-Isn't today Friday?
-then I'm sure

519
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:43,010
-it will be a bestseller for months and--
-It's past 7:00 p.m.

520
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,972
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

521
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,349
-Hey! You're dripping...
-You could have told me sooner.

522
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,685
Hey! Yeong-sin!

523
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,813
-Take off the gloves!
-I did!

524
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,357
This is Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

525
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,943
You met the man who set himself on fire
in front of city hall,

526
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,486
-There he is.
-didn't you?

527
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,446
Yes, I did.

528
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:08,703
I heard he did that to protest
against the layoffs at Samhan Industries.

529
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,912
What did he say?

530
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,039
Sure, that is one of the reasons.

531
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,874
SAMHAN INDUSTRIES HAS REACHED A SETTLEMENT

532
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,752
But the main reason
he took such an extreme measure

533
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,505
was something else.

534
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:25,303
Suffering from third-degree burns
all over his body, he told me this.

535
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,763
"No one has listened to us."

536
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,476
Not a single word about them
was mentioned in any paper.

537
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,729
He said he set himself on fire

538
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,732
to draw people's attention.

539
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,737
What did the company say about--

540
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,198
Even I, a reporter, went to see him

541
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,075
only after the tragic event.

542
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,957
Before then, we didn't care
about Samhan's layoffs.

543
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,376
It wasn't worth covering, was it?

544
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,171
-Mun-ho, so--
-So, that is why

545
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,798
that man poured gasoline
all over his body.

546
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:09,889
The biggest reason he set himself
on fire was us.

547
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,266
It was because of us, reporters.

548
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,685
Oh, my.

549
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,858
This is my first dream.

550
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,362
I dreamed of becoming
a cool and sexy reporter like him.

551
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:36,123
But I was not the brightest student,
so I went to a so-so college.

552
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:41,337
My dad is way too frugal,
so I gave up on studying abroad long ago.

553
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,547
I have no luck with tests,

554
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,592
so I failed every newspaper
and TV station test.

555
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:51,138
But I am sure that I'm more persistent
and passionate than anyone else.

556
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,019
So at some point, I will achieve my dream.

557
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,897
I will become a cool and sexy
legendary reporter

558
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,691
that the whole world knows of.

559
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,405
However, what if I try and keep failing?

560
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,034
Well, I'll think about it then.

561
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,343
The chicken in the oven should be done.

562
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,220
The plates are there, so...

563
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:18,350
No, I'll do it.
Just take it out of the oven please.

564
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,602
Yes, ma'am.

565
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,562
When did you prepare all of this?

566
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,072
This is amazing.

567
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,413
I feel like it becomes grander
year after year.

568
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,917
It means my cooking is improving.

569
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,545
But aren't there too many sweets
for a memorial?

570
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,756
I never let her eat them,
but she liked them so much.

571
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,217
I said she would get cavities.

572
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,680
I don't know
why I made it such a big deal.

573
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,766
That's always bothered me.

574
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,728
That's why I want to make her
a lot of sweets, at least on her memorial.

575
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,947
You're okay with is, right?

576
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,575
I thought Gil-han should be here too.

577
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,494
Yes, of course.

578
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,664
Gil-han should be here.

579
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,584
He is Ji-an's father after all.

580
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,795
Right, the chicken.

581
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,257
It's Ji-an's next favorite after sweets.

582
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,384
Why isn't Mun-ho here yet?

583
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,012
Every year, he usually comes
in the morning to help you

584
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,471
preparing for Ji-an's memorial service.

585
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,390
I know.

586
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,811
Would you call him? And tell him I'm mad.

587
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,271
Tell him I'm really upset.

588
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,581
Hello?

589
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,209
Where are you?
Myeong-hui asked me to call you.

590
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,966
-Mun-ho.
-I don't think I can go.

591
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,843
What do you mean?

592
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,095
Did you forget
that it's Ji-an's death anniversary?

593
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,599
I know, but I can't make it.

594
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,934
Please tell her that I'm sorry.

595
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,605
Is this because of what happened at work?

596
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,107
I heard you caused trouble on air again.

597
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,611
You're so well-informed.

598
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,363
Goodness.

599
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,198
Maybe it's because you're one of them.

600
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,534
You seem to get all the information
before anyone else.

601
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,869
Watch yourself.

602
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,830
There's only so much I can do for you.

603
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,876
-Tell her I'm sorry, okay? Bye.
-Mun-ho.

604
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,964
You know I'm always on your side, right?

605
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,730
Did I call too late?

606
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,440
Any results?

607
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,359
I was wondering why you weren't calling.

608
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,989
No, the DNA test shows
that they are not related at all.

609
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,118
I see.

610
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,287
Isn't this the third time already?

611
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,164
Who exactly are you looking for?

612
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,707
Let's just say

613
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,960
it's someone I must find.

614
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,646
Another day has passed.

615
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,400
Each and every day

616
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,652
feels like homework to me.

617
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:43,740
I'm sorry.

618
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,453
We sent most of our guys, but--

619
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,495
That's fine.

620
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:53,083
The other side had so many resources.

621
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,836
They had information that we didn't have,

622
00:45:56,295 --> 00:46:01,633
and we missed Ko Seong-cheol
right before our eyes.

623
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,343
It was so close.

624
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,803
It was very close!

625
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,929
Was that person...

626
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,432
Healer?

627
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,228
-Do you know him?
-I do.

628
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,190
I was going to hire him instead of you.

629
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:20,652
-Sir? Hello?
-Thank you.

630
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,780
Hello?

631
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,035
Damn it!

632
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,654
HEALER

633
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:18,627
My life has been stuck
in two moments of the past.

634
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:23,382
The year of 1980 and 1992.

635
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,301
I try my best

636
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,513
to move forward,

637
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:34,601
but on nights like this, I find myself

638
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,895
helplessly returning

639
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,606
to those times.

640
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,406
-Freedom!
-Freedom!

641
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,117
-Once again...
-We've returned persistently.

642
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,994
Those of you who are tuning in...

643
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,245
You. Yes, you.

644
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,331
Please record and spread this.

645
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,750
-Spread what?
-Our talks.

646
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,586
-Why?
-Because they won't let you listen.

647
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:07,217
The topic that we must talk about
and you must hear

648
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,637
is President Chun Doo-hwan's
curtailment of the press.

649
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,891
About 1,000 reporters were kicked out
in the last two months.

650
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,394
So, on what ground were they kicked out?

651
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,606
Stop questioning.
If you question them, you will get fired.

652
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:32,367
Those in the reporters' association
who resisted against the government

653
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,161
were fired.

654
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:38,707
Those who tried to protect
media autonomy were fired.

655
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,792
The executive editors
who criticized the government...

656
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,378
Mun-ho, when did you take off
your seatbelt?

657
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,466
But isn't the media supposed to question
what's going on?

658
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,802
Yes, the media should question
and expose the truth.

659
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,805
If they don't question
or expose something suspicious,

660
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,098
they aren't the media.

661
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,933
Media? No way.

662
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,393
-That is garbage.
-That is garbage.

663
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,984
We're also picking up the signal here.

664
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,779
They must be broadcasting
near Jangseungbaegi.

665
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,197
What are you doing? Get moving!

666
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,114
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

667
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,735
I heard that they are coming.

668
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,905
The police must have finally caught on.

669
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,782
It's time for us to pack up too.

670
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:08,964
Hey, you!

671
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,809
Is that...

672
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,894
Stop that car! Turn around!

673
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,191
Hey, Mun-sik!

674
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,055
Are you listening to us right now?

675
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,473
You. Yes, you.

676
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,683
If you see her, will you tell her?

677
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,144
That we are searching desperately for her.

678
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,648
Hey, where are you? What are you doing?

679
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,734
Do you know how desperately
we're looking for you?

680
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,486
-Freedom!
-Freedom!

681
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,029
-Where are you?
-Where are you?

682
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,365
-Here I am!
-Here I am!

683
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,376
That was incredible acting!

684
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,962
The motorcycle was flying in the air...

685
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,464
-It was like a movie.
-He drove like crazy too.

686
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,384
Anyway, both of you were insane.

687
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,387
Hey. Don't touch that.

688
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,138
Why not?

689
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,474
Mun-ho, will you take a picture of us?

690
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,893
We can't leave pictures behind.
It's dangerous.

691
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,979
We feed on danger.

692
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,897
It's like dry fish and seafood pancake.

693
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,650
Mun-ho, take our picture.

694
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,403
-Let's take a picture.
-Get up.

695
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,363
Mun-sik! Get over here.

696
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,158
You guys are so cheesy. How immature.

697
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,451
Look at him.

698
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,247
-Hey, smile!
-Let's go!

699
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:52,544
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

700
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,566
Ji-an.

701
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,486
I'll make you a purple cake
for your birthday.

702
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,531
I made a pink cake today.

703
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,408
Do you like it?

704
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,292
Gil-han.

705
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,795
You're taking care
of our Ji-an over there, right?

706
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,340
You...

707
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,345
You have to stay with Ji-an there.

708
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,140
That way,

709
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,060
our Ji-an can...

710
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,580
My life is stuck in the past.

711
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:14,292
That's why I haven't been able to
move forward.

712
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,588
Once I find that child,

713
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,093
maybe I will be able to move on.

714
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,013
THE SAMPLE I SENT WAS NEGATIVE.
PLEASE KEEP SEARCHING.

715
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:31,768
TO: HEALER

716
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:55,250
A leopard or a wolf would be fine too.

717
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,921
I'll raise an animal like that
when I go to my island later.

718
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,678
MS. JO

719
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,806
I need a lot of things.

720
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:13,935
First, I need a decent yacht, a generator,

721
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,478
and a filter for salt water purification.

722
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,904
Why aren't you picking up?

723
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,407
I'm eating.

724
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,993
Do you remember the guy
who asked you to find that girl?

725
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,038
I found him three girls already.

726
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,998
None of them were her.

727
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:40,378
But I found someone
who could be her this time.

728
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,380
She was adopted 20 years ago.

729
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,258
I looked into the places she was
before being adopted,

730
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,135
and everything is pointing at her.

731
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:51,014
This is a nice one.

732
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,309
Even if it isn't her,
as long as we send a DNA sample,

733
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,603
we still get paid for the job.

734
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,938
This kind of request
is the cream of the crop.

735
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,319
I'm thinking of building a cabin
on my deserted island.

736
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,072
Then, I'll need to transport
building materials.

737
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,282
I guess I'll need a big yacht.

738
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,577
That means I need to make more money.

739
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,246
A lot more.

740
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,296
My second dream
is to find my biological parents.

741
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,216
Aren't you sleeping?

742
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,426
I'm about to.

743
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,386
Did you close the window?

744
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,514
I'm about to.

745
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,315
Go to bed.

746
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:45,944
Aren't you sick of waking up late
and rushing in the morning?

747
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,529
I'm in bed now.

748
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,534
Of course I love my dad, Mr. Chae Chi-su,
though he always nags me,

749
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,079
but I'm still curious
about my biological parents.

750
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,040
What were my parents like?

751
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,544
Why did they abandon me?

752
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,090
I don't resent them.

753
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,802
Thanks to them abandoning me,
I met my current dad.

754
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,598
I just want to meet them.

755
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,351
I wish I could see them even from afar.

756
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,980
My real mom and dad.

757
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,860
Then I will know
that I'm not an android or something

758
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,695
and be able to feel at ease.

759
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,078
My first dream and my second dream

760
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,914
seem like they are a million miles away
and impossible to come true.

761
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,084
Despite that, I still believe

762
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,712
that my dreams will come true
if I don't give up.

763
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,047
I believe I will meet them
if I am meant to.

764
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,258
So, what does she look like?

765
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,761
Her name is Chae Yeong-sin. Born in 1988.

766
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:58,057
She doesn't have any blogs
or any social media accounts.

767
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,435
I don't think she's normal.

768
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,770
NAME: CHAE YEONG-SIN
REPORTER AT SOMEDAY NEWS

769
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:03,730
Bingo.

770
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,837
She's quick-witted. How annoying.

771
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,214
That's my bag, isn't it?

772
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,966
That makes you a thief, right?

773
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,467
She must be the right one.

774
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,303
Our favorite client
sent a follow-up request.

775
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,388
Quit your job.

776
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,390
Work for me and I'll give you a newsroom.

777
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,517
There is an incident
that I'm investigating.

778
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,644
Wouldn't it be easier
to work on it together?

779
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,146
Healer, you've become a fugitive.

780
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,940
Wrap it up in there.

781
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,192
I need to stay with this girl
a little longer.

782
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,902
I believe in things like that.

783
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,863
Fate and destiny. Things like that.
