1
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,596
Jun-seok!

2
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,642
You're Jun-seok, right?

3
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,811
Right?

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,836
Myeong-hui!

5
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,680
-Myeong-hui!
-Let go. That man...

6
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,015
What did you just say?

7
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,810
You saw him too, right? It was Jun-seok!

8
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,520
What are you saying?

9
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,689
That man just now...

10
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,278
Jun-seok?

11
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,697
Seo Jun-seok?

12
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,242
I guess it can't be.

13
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,995
-Myeong-hui.
-You're right.

14
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,289
It can't be.

15
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,959
Jun-seok died more than 20 years ago.

16
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,544
He wouldn't be here

17
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,754
looking the same as he did back then.

18
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,928
What is wrong with me?

19
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,849
He looks that much like him?

20
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,603
That man just now looked like Jun-seok?

21
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,107
Really?

22
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,409
You'll catch a cold.

23
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,341
-That man last night was a thief?
-Yes.

24
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,801
I walked in on him,

25
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,262
so he ran away empty-handed.

26
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,224
But then you showed up
in front of him suddenly.

27
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,184
You scared me to death.

28
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,102
I'm sorry for talking nonsense.

29
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,272
Did that thief look
that much like Jun-seok?

30
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,566
Actually, I didn't get
a good look at his face.

31
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,068
He was wearing a cap and sunglasses.

32
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,821
You know my medicine
makes me dream with my eyes open.

33
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,573
Were talking in your sleep?

34
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,450
While looking completely lucid?

35
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,202
Stop it.

36
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,832
-I have a favor.
-Anything.

37
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,835
It might be because I saw him in my dream,

38
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,632
but I want to contact Jun-seok's wife.

39
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,177
I heard she got remarried after he died.

40
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,265
Wouldn't she feel uncomfortable
if you contact her?

41
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,183
Please. Get her number for me.

42
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,102
Fine.

43
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,233
-Have a good day.
-You too.

44
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,660
-Jun-seok had a son, didn't he?
-Yes.

45
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,871
-What was his name?
-Jeong-hu. Seo Jeong-hu.

46
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,375
-And his age?
-He's one month older than Ji-an.

47
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,794
Ji-an was born in January,
Jeong-hu was born in December.

48
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,839
They said he was
the older brother by a month.

49
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,633
So, he should be 28 now?

50
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,802
Right.

51
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,426
Call Ms. Jo.

52
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:49,140
Honey, I'm not in right now.

53
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,350
Leave me a message and--

54
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,564
I know you pretend to not be there...

55
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,359
when you don't want to answer. But Ms. Jo,

56
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,948
is this why you and the old geezer
tried to put me on a plane?

57
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,701
The lady living here knows my dad.

58
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,245
She has a picture with my dad too.

59
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,957
What's going on?
You don't want to tell me?

60
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,960
Then I'll go and ask her myself.

61
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,547
"I'm Seo Jun-seok's son,
and I'm also known as Healer.

62
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,842
Who are you?"

63
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,143
Fine. I'm hanging up.

64
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,522
Hi, kid. How have you been?

65
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,025
You perverted old geezer.

66
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,078
That lady's name is Choi Myeong-hui.

67
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,581
You know the woman
in that group photo with your dad?

68
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,918
That's her. Is that enough for you?

69
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,338
That's probably not enough, is it?

70
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,260
Fine, I'll come to you.

71
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,138
Are you crying? You are, aren't you?

72
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,099
You missed your master that badly?

73
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,061
Wait a little bit more, and don't cry.

74
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,449
After my mother left me when I was eight,

75
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,576
I never cried over a human being.

76
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,036
I don't expect anything
from a human being.

77
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,914
What I hate most in this world are...

78
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,336
the understanding and interest
from another human being.

79
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,397
You morons.

80
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,277
Why can't you go a week
without causing trouble?

81
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,196
Raise your hands high, you punk.

82
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,074
Seo Jeong-hu is going to cause
quite a headache.

83
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,619
But please be understanding.

84
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,830
He doesn't have parents.

85
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,582
He lives with his grandmother.

86
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,000
What happened?

87
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,254
His father passed away when he was young
and his mother got remarried.

88
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,924
That's why he's filled with rage.

89
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,927
How did your father...

90
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,638
-Was he sick?
-He wasn't sick.

91
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,725
-He did it to himself.
-Pardon?

92
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:42,855
You know, he did it himself.
It was a tragedy.

93
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,609
There is no way Jeong-hu
can be fine inside.

94
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:52,657
So, please be extra understanding
and take care of him.

95
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,258
What? What is it?

96
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,305
Don't touch him. Leave him alone.

97
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,723
Just let him be.

98
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,268
What did you say?

99
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,398
-Let go!
-Stop it!

100
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,108
Let go!

101
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,245
CHAE YEONG-SIN

102
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,303
-Hello?
-Hey, Bong-su.

103
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,683
Where are you?
Did you really search clubs all night?

104
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,520
Did you get some sleep?
Why weren't you picking up?

105
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,318
Bong-su. Park Bong-su?

106
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,069
Yes.

107
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,030
Are you okay?

108
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,949
I'm fine.

109
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,077
What's wrong with your voice? Bong-su?

110
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,789
Yes, ma'am?

111
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,334
Why are you being formal?
You're scaring me.

112
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:33,090
Then, should I stop being formal?

113
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,134
Shut it. Now choose.

114
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,512
East or west. Which is it?

115
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,308
-What?
-I received something from someone.

116
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,436
I need to report it
to Kim Mun-ho when I get to work.

117
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,315
But I have to decide
to what extent I should report it.

118
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,861
So, is it east or west?

119
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,031
Look, ma'am. I...

120
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,366
East or west?

121
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,539
-East.
-Gosh. I guess I should, right?

122
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,210
-Okay, bye.
-Wait.

123
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,420
Wait, about reporting that--

124
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,505
Have you had breakfast?

125
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,882
If not, go eat. You can come in late.

126
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,596
What I hate most in this world are

127
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,394
the understanding and interest
from another human being.

128
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,730
That was how I was.

129
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,952
My father, a lawyer specializing
in theft and assault cases,

130
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,830
said people must trust other people.

131
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,500
Of the fifty that you trust,
one will stab you in the back.

132
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,422
Don't doubt the remaining 49
because of that one.

133
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,216
But then,

134
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,718
he said...

135
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,641
I told you. Don't be stupid
and follow anyone.

136
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,104
Be careful of people who come close
to you and are nice to you.

137
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,283
Excuse me. Are you still there?

138
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,953
Excuse me.

139
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,956
-Gosh! What the--
-I would like to ask you something.

140
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,125
What?

141
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,795
Is this Someday News?

142
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,466
Someday News is on the third floor.
What brings you here?

143
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,135
-Do you work at Someday News?
-I do.

144
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,141
Did Kim Mun-ho come in today?

145
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,852
Not yet. But...

146
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,188
Do you know him?

147
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,818
I'm Kim Mun-ho's favorite right-hand man,
as the old saying goes.

148
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,737
Let's say I'm his best pupil.

149
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,117
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Jong-su.

150
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,495
Then you must know Kim Mun-ho well.

151
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,125
Well, yes. I know him a little too well.

152
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,376
What is he like?

153
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,462
What? You want dirt on him?

154
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,464
Then let's swap.

155
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,049
I'll tell you about him.

156
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,010
You tell me about Chae Yeong-sin.

157
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,556
You know Chae Yeong-sin?

158
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,768
No, that's why I want
to investigate a little first.

159
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,144
So, what is she like?

160
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,774
I heard rumors that Mun-ho
came here because of her.

161
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,944
Is she super hot and sexy?

162
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,115
Or is she so frail and innocent
that you want to protect her?

163
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,201
I would say she is neither.

164
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,412
So, she's from a rich family.

165
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,583
I guess you like girls from rich families.

166
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,339
-Hi, Mun-ho.
-Why are you here?

167
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,674
How have you been?

168
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,884
I missed you.

169
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:06,887
Yeong-sin.

170
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,723
Did you finish your homework?

171
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,561
Actually, I was waiting for you
to tell you something.

172
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,689
But not in front of other people, though.

173
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,066
-Let's go out somewhere quiet.
-Looking like that?

174
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,113
My office is ready now.
It's quiet if we close the door.

175
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:28,576
-Do I embarrass you? Why?
-Yes.

176
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,080
So, she's Chae Yeong-sin. Wow.

177
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,524
The videos in this external hard drive
add up to about 220 hours.

178
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,194
The videos are of
Jeguk Entertainment's actresses

179
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,572
servicing various men which are
recorded by hidden cameras.

180
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,117
-You watched all the videos?
-All of them.

181
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,911
-All night?
-All night.

182
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,372
I fast-forwarded some,
paused and took notes,

183
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,459
almost threw up a few times,
but I watched them all.

184
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,793
Where did you get it?

185
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,880
-Pardon?
-This hard drive.

186
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,633
Well--

187
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,468
Right, who gave it to you?

188
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,179
Is there a whistleblower? Who is it?

189
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,685
-Actually, I hesitated.
-What?

190
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,188
I didn't know if I could trust you,
Kim Mun-ho.

191
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,358
Yeong-sin, what are you saying?

192
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,737
This informant is someone
I have been investigating for a long time.

193
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,864
And it was very difficult
getting in touch with him.

194
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:54,745
I don't know why,
but he is friendly to me.

195
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,665
Honestly, I'm afraid that you'll use
your position

196
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:02,503
to snatch away my story that I've been
working on for such a long time.

197
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,882
She loses her mind when she lacks sleep.

198
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,342
-But she--
-So, if you promise

199
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,221
to let me be the sole contact
with this person--

200
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,180
I promise.

201
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,349
Who is it?

202
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,063
Have you ever heard of night messengers?

203
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,231
Hey, you...

204
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,692
There is one who goes by
the code name, Healer.

205
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,194
You and that nonsense.

206
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,863
Did you...

207
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,075
Do you know him?

208
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,660
I do.

209
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,460
They are in the middle
of a confidential meeting.

210
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,379
-Authorized personnel only.
-Right.

211
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,306
Good morning.
I found what you asked me to find.

212
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,935
-Come back later.
-I'll be right out.

213
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,898
You know how you asked me
to find Hwang Je-guk's regular club?

214
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,984
So, I...

215
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,861
I found it.

216
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,572
So, the name of the club is...

217
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,411
Right, it's Lunar Moon.
It's called Lunar Moon.

218
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,330
Did you stay up all night?

219
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,709
Still, you should at least wash your face.

220
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey, I had no--

221
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,671
-Hey, let's...
-Let me see.

222
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,757
You did a good job.

223
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,383
NEW MAIL FROM HEALER

224
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,307
NEW MAIL FROM HEALER

225
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,235
What I just saw...

226
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,948
"You received a new mail
from Healer." That Healer...

227
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,577
Is it that Healer?

228
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,708
Is it?

229
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,924
So, where should I write down
the name of the club?

230
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,425
Here...

231
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,887
Seriously.

232
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,767
-Would you excuse us?
-Pardon?

233
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,979
Yes, of course. Hey, Bong-su.

234
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,398
-Get up.
-Yes, but...

235
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,151
-What about Lunar Moon?
-Later. Let's go.

236
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,665
Healer at moebius dot com.

237
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,377
I know that as Healer's email address.

238
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,714
Famous hackers and police
cybercrime teams tried to find

239
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,384
the owner of that email address,
but all failed.

240
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,345
One hacker tracked him nonstop
for four days

241
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,597
but ended up at his own home.

242
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,141
That legendary email address...

243
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,646
Why did Healer email you of all people?

244
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,983
This is interesting.

245
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,287
Did you email Kim Mun-ho?

246
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,082
Yes, just now. You told me to.

247
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,044
You said to ask for specific details
and information on

248
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,173
for whom and why
we must protect Chae Yeong-sin.

249
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,678
Yes, but why now, out of all the--

250
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,930
I've set the transmission of the bug.

251
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,683
Who are you listening in on?

252
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,560
Wait. Be quiet.

253
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,688
Do you know Healer personally?

254
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,024
No.

255
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,570
Then did you hire him as a client?

256
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,407
Yes.

257
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,666
What the...

258
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:16,006
Are you the one who told him
to get the external hard drive?

259
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:25,098
That wasn't the exact request, but
it seems he crossed the line a bit.

260
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:30,229
May I ask what exactly you hired him for?

261
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,271
No.

262
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,856
Why not?

263
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,650
How many times should I tell you?

264
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,321
You'll never get a proper answer from
an interviewee if you ask like that.

265
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,742
I was almost kidnapped by some thugs
in an alley not long ago.

266
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,244
Healer saved me.

267
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,038
Did you request for that too?

268
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:53,210
You have no skills in appeasing
or intimidating the other person.

269
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,964
He stole my bag
and took a nail clipping too.

270
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,259
Did you have him do that as well?

271
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,761
Let's stop here. Get out.

272
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,514
Why would the famous Reporter Kim Mun-ho

273
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,058
look into a B-rated reporter
whom he has never met?

274
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,062
Why would you protect and save me?
Why would you take my DNA?

275
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,940
It's strange. How could I not ask?

276
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,441
How could I stop here and leave?

277
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,245
You have no skills or logic...

278
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,123
but you have spirit.

279
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,499
Goodness.

280
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,420
I wanted to leave the TV station

281
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,090
to run my own newspaper company.

282
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,636
So I was looking around,
and Someday News was one of them.

283
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,348
I had to do my due diligence
before deciding

284
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,143
and look into each and every reporter.

285
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,229
I needed to know what skills
and background they had.

286
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,147
Then...

287
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,942
-it wasn't just me, but--
-Yes.

288
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,321
I ran a background search
on every reporter here.

289
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,366
What about my DNA?

290
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,787
I don't know what you mean.

291
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,789
Why did you protect me from the thugs?

292
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:17,085
Of course I should.
You must be my human shield from now on.

293
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,714
Even a petty foot soldier is precious.

294
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,969
Any other questions?

295
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:32,517
The interviewee has started to talk.
This is when you clamp down.

296
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,186
I'm done.

297
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,980
-Done with what?
-Just...

298
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,900
I feel like garbage.

299
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,693
Why?

300
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,322
I feel humiliated, that's why.

301
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,868
Thinking of what I said to Healer
when I met him yesterday...

302
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,871
I just want to die.

303
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,708
I thought he felt...

304
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,461
That I was...

305
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,382
Never mind.

306
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,176
You have met him?

307
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,430
-You saw Healer's face?
-Then I would have known...

308
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:16,103
just how pathetic he thought I was.

309
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,068
Thank you for your response.
I'll leave now.

310
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:41,211
Wow. Reporters are really scary.

311
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,923
How could he lie so quickly
on the spot like that?

312
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,885
Even their lies are creative, aren't they?

313
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,257
That is everything on Chae Yeong-sin.

314
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,259
As you assumed,

315
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,386
she was adopted
when she was eight years old.

316
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,055
Did you say eight?

317
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,185
She was abandoned when she was five.

318
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,731
She bounced around some foster homes...

319
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,781
And she was adopted
by Chae Chi-su when she was eight.

320
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,368
Chae Chi-su is the attorney
representing the Joo Yeon-hui case.

321
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,163
Where was she first found?

322
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,916
It was somewhere in Seoul.

323
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,585
I heard it was near Shindang-dong.

324
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:09,132
She was found behind some dumpster
in an alley.

325
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:14,054
At first, she didn't speak at all,
so they thought she was mute.

326
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,265
Even in her adoption papers
with Chae Chi-su, it says

327
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,684
she had speech impairment.

328
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,608
CHAIRMAN KIM MUN-SIK

329
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,591
Is there anything you would like me to do?

330
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,759
Now?

331
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,391
No. You can go.

332
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,443
Please find Ji-an.

333
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,822
If I can't find her, I...

334
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,033
I can't face Gil-han even after I die.

335
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,411
How could I face him?

336
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,208
Mun-sik, please.

337
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,752
Please find my Ji-an.

338
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,798
Please.

339
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,266
SHE WAS FOUND BEHIND
A DUMPSTER BY A GARBAGE TRUCK DRIVER

340
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,559
Here it is.

341
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,645
Last month on the 27th, around 6:30 A.M,

342
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,064
A garbage truck driver found her.

343
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,276
She was behind the dumpster,
so he didn't see her

344
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,112
and was shocked to see her
while collecting the trash.

345
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,605
Mom...

346
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,492
Why did you do it?

347
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,333
You should have just brought her home

348
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,711
if you were going to live
in fear all your life.

349
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,895
What? You thought if Ji-an was there,
Myeong-hui could never leave Gil-han?

350
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,814
Because she would never go to you?

351
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,691
Right? Am I right?

352
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,446
How come I am never wrong?

353
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,041
Why did you do it?

354
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,924
We were friends.

355
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,762
Mun-sik.

356
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,432
We were friends.

357
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,309
Friends...

358
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,397
shouldn't do that to each other.

359
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,074
I have never seen him so out of it

360
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,285
in my 10 years with him.

361
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,455
I think the child they lost in 1992

362
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,124
is intentionally approaching him.

363
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,251
She approached Kim Mun-ho first,

364
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,254
and it looks like
he has already been won over.

365
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,298
I don't know her exact intentions.

366
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,801
Shall I find out her intentions first?

367
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,970
You know, Kim Mun-sik is

368
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:29,142
the best among
all the people I'm training.

369
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,563
He is intelligent, but he knows his place.

370
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,526
He knows his place, but he doesn't grovel.

371
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,322
A great commander
who knows when to charge or retreat.

372
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,492
But you know...

373
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,080
Mun-sik has one weakness.

374
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,791
It's that daughter.

375
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:59,714
That daughter can instantly turn him
into a balloon doll.

376
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,049
You know, the kind that...

377
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,053
waves its arms and legs
in front of a restaurant.

378
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,389
One poke of the needle and it pops.

379
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,517
We can't...

380
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,896
let Mun-sik turn into one of those.

381
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,481
Yes, Boss.

382
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,609
It's best to nip it in the bud.

383
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,071
We should send Kim Mun-ho a clear warning.

384
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:28,076
I'll take care of it
without Kim Mun-sik finding out.

385
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,037
Yes, Boss.

386
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,595
Be especially wary
of Kim Mun-sik's assistant, Oh Tae-won.

387
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,055
And...

388
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,522
And don't personally contact
Chae Yeong-sin again.

389
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,571
-Chae Yeong-sin.
-Yes?

390
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,447
Can you interview Joo Yeon-hui?

391
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,367
Tell her we'll blur out her face
and disguise her voice.

392
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,202
Go and get details,
and focus on Kim Ui-chan.

393
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,787
-Yes.
-Newbie.

394
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,873
-Yes?
-Can you work a camera?

395
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,833
Yes, I have shot videos
often using a cell phone--

396
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,210
Take this and film her interview.

397
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,713
Wait. I have never worked
with cameras like...

398
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,756
Do you know any detectives?

399
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,261
All the detectives I know
are close to politicians.

400
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,513
You want to report on the video
from Hwang Je-guk?

401
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,100
If we publish it first,
they may hide more evidence.

402
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,561
It's best to cooperate
with the police investigation.

403
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,522
That way, we won't become
like stray dogs later.

404
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:43,443
That being said, we need
a trustworthy detective to work with.

405
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,570
There's one.

406
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,240
There is a detective
monitoring Hwang Je-guk.

407
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,826
I'm sure he would like the video.

408
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,786
Good. Come with me.

409
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,580
Yes, sir.

410
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,958
This is Lee Jong-su.
He worked for me at the station.

411
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,920
Although he's a goofball,
he's pretty good at this work.

412
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,423
-Hello. I'm Lee Jong-su.
-Hello.

413
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,842
Is it okay if he joins us?

414
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,929
Why do you want to put him...

415
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,556
Why would you leave such a good job...

416
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,643
I really don't understand either of you.

417
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,478
Tell him what you told me.

418
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,106
-I'm here as a spy.
-As a what?

419
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,441
President Kim Mun-sik,

420
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:29,364
Mun-ho's brother, asked me
to come work here and spy on Mun-ho.

421
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,242
But you want me to let him do that?

422
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:37,413
As I said, he's quite skillful
and we need the manpower.

423
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,085
-What are you doing?
-We're going.

424
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,586
What did I tell you to focus on?

425
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,463
Focus on Kim Ui-chan.

426
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,673
-Why?
-What?

427
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,008
Why must you focus on Kim Ui-chan?

428
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,139
You're the one who told me to...

429
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,270
I stayed up all night working on that.

430
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,606
Couldn't he say, "Good job"?

431
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,027
Will his reason for living crumble?
Seriously.

432
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,284
But hey, is this your car?

433
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:16,869
I'm sorry?

434
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,581
Your family must be pretty well-off.

435
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,544
You even paid your way in.

436
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,502
What? Hey. Wait...

437
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,965
Yeong-sin!

438
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,847
It's been so long!

439
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,557
How long has it been?

440
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,603
We thought we'd never see you again!

441
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,858
Yeong-sin, if you keep getting prettier,
someone may kidnap you.

442
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,445
Are you still single?
Do you want me to find you a guy?

443
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:36,115
Hey, shut it.
Yeong-sin is never getting married.

444
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,950
She's too good for anyone.

445
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,121
Yeong-sin, do you still do that thing?

446
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,625
You know, that thing. This.

447
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,428
Hey!

448
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,473
Get out. Get out now.

449
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,976
-Come on, don't be like that.
-You're so mean.

450
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,019
What's wrong with you?

451
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,062
Why you...

452
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,147
Get out! I told you to get out!

453
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,651
We didn't have any customers today
because of you guys.

454
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,904
You said you would leave
once you saw Yeong-sin!

455
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,156
See you later, Yeong-sin!

456
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,414
The preparations are almost complete.

457
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,627
Assistant Oh, don't you fret.

458
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,922
We at Double S Guard specialize
in using our brains

459
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,383
even more than our bodies.

460
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,805
And I have a guy that I worked
very hard to bring all the way from China.

461
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,516
One hour?

462
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,310
Yes, sir. I'll have it ready.

463
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,063
Yes. Don't you worry.

464
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,151
This old man won't stop nagging.

465
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,902
Come on!

466
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,405
I'm giving you one hour.

467
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,490
Finish in an hour no matter what.

468
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,327
No matter how hard they tried...

469
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,165
no one would listen to their story.

470
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,501
No one would listen to their story.

471
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,130
No one would listen to their story.

472
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,346
So, you want to do an interview?

473
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,683
We'll blur out her face
or tape it from behind.

474
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,768
And we'll disguise her voice too.
You don't have to worry.

475
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,103
What do you think?

476
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,856
I want to do it.

477
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,358
I said so from the beginning.

478
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,195
I said I would do anything I can.

479
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,614
Wait. Hold on.

480
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,909
When I saw their attorneys,
they seemed like the type

481
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,412
to nitpick every little thing we say

482
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:51,042
and twist our words around
to use them against us.

483
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:57,089
If we do an interview, it might become
unfavorable for us during the trial.

484
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,258
-Mr. Chae.
-Yes?

485
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,136
I never asked you to make it easy for me.

486
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,098
I just asked you not to let those thugs
get away with it

487
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,100
and not to let me die alone.

488
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,482
I need to talk to my client
about what she should...

489
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,403
and shouldn't say
if she agrees to do an interview.

490
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,614
Okay.

491
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,668
-Do you know how to assemble it?
-What?

492
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:41,842
It's made to be easily assembled,
so I'm sure I'll work it out somehow.

493
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,929
I'll figure it out.

494
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,810
Mister.

495
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,020
I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

496
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,730
Do you want some toast?

497
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,441
Do you want it with coconut jam or ham?

498
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,568
You really know how to assemble it?

499
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,153
Should I find the manual?

500
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:05,408
-I'm fine.
-True. I heard from your master

501
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,369
that your dad was a genius with machines.

502
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,331
He said if he took one look at a machine,
he could operate it and fix it.

503
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:20,047
Kim Mun-ho sent an email,
but it's more like a warning.

504
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,383
What warning?

505
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,551
A warning.

506
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,722
"Don't personally contact
Chae Yeong-sin again."

507
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,184
What the...

508
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,063
Do as he says.
He may not pay us if you don't.

509
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,648
Then all our hard work
will be for nothing.

510
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,405
Wow. New things really are nice.

511
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,198
-How expensive is it?
-I don't know.

512
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,536
This is nice. It's pretty good.

513
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,539
Not bad. It looks good.

514
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,418
Okay, we'll have Yeon-hui sit here.

515
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,339
Should we shoot from the side?

516
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,097
-What are you doing?
-Contact.

517
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,851
-What?
-Personal contact.

518
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,982
-Like this.
-You have lost your mind.

519
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,693
You're insane.

520
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,320
Get a room, why don't you?

521
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,325
Did your master call?
Didn't he say he would come see you?

522
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,913
Right. I talked to him earlier
and he asked something strange.

523
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:38,000
He wanted to know
if you like fresh fruit or chocolate.

524
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,211
That was so random.

525
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,297
Is that a secret code between you two?

526
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,917
What are you doing?

527
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,877
Testing the camera.

528
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,551
-Excuse me.
-Leave me alone. I'm depressed.

529
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,180
If you're depressed,
isn't the normal thing to do

530
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,558
is to either drink or cry?

531
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,687
One, two, three. Mic test.
One, two, three.

532
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:46,485
Hello, everyone. Standing before you
is a woman who was rejected

533
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,362
by two of her crushes simultaneously.

534
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:53,325
But she is standing here reporting
because she is a true reporter.

535
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,912
The first one

536
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,000
called this woman his human shield,
and the second...

537
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,588
thinks she's a delusional hog
craving attention.

538
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,592
But let's forget them quickly.

539
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,971
Like a sad dream in the night.

540
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,892
Like when darkness fades
when the morning sun rises.

541
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,813
Let's forget.

542
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,191
Let's say...

543
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:27,902
it never really...

544
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,498
What a nice day.

545
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,791
The forecast called
for the first snow of the year.

546
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,959
Liars.

547
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,808
We're ready. Let's begin the interview.

548
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,310
Okay, let's go.

549
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:12,238
Did you know
what you were being called to do?

550
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,408
He said I had to meet him
since he was someone

551
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,369
who helped our company.

552
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,455
-Who said that?
-President Hwang Je-guk.

553
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,293
What did he say about Assemblyman K?

554
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,171
-Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan?
-Yes.

555
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,800
That he was going to be
the next mayor of Seoul.

556
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:38,472
That the mayor of Seoul was likely
to become the future president of Korea.

557
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,519
So, if I win his favor...

558
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:46,981
my life...

559
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,693
would be easy later on.

560
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,787
Did you want to make your life easier?

561
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,666
Is that why you went
and serviced the powerful men

562
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,043
and were seeing Assemblyman Kim?

563
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,928
-I went too far. Let's move on...
-You don't know.

564
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,307
You can say that because you don't know.

565
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,727
You don't know how scary they are.

566
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,857
Those people will do anything
to protect their money, positions,

567
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,736
anything to protect what belongs to them.

568
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,572
Acting like this is just...

569
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,782
common sense to them.

570
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,335
-Are you ready?
-You ready?

571
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,252
Yes.

572
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,468
Park Bong-su speaking. Hello?

573
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,303
Hey, kid.

574
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,640
You old geezer. Do you know what time...

575
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,895
Where are you?

576
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,814
Do you like chocolates or sweet potatoes?

577
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,775
Seeing how you keep speaking gibberish,

578
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,611
you never intended
to come see me, did you?

579
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,240
Run on over. I'll see you at your home.

580
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,910
Do I have to run over if you tell me to?

581
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,205
-Hey, you old geezer.
-Don't be late.

582
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,250
You know I don't wait
more than five minutes for guys.

583
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,211
Wait.

584
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,089
Five minutes from when? Hello...

585
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,257
Master. Hello?

586
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,430
-Please tell her I left first.
-Hold on.

587
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,057
Take this with you.

588
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,269
Yeong-sin said to pack you a bag.

589
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,230
I made something really tasty.

590
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,818
What day...

591
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,113
is it today?

592
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:02,741
Today is the 22nd.

593
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,535
Gosh.

594
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,081
-That's what it was?
-What?

595
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,500
It's...

596
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,585
It's my birthday.

597
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,590
That old geezer...

598
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,386
Hey!

599
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,513
Hey!

600
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,614
-Hello?
-Chae Yeong-sin.

601
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,034
-Mr. Kim?
-You need to come right away.

602
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,412
Get in a taxi and come right now.

603
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,080
What's going on?

604
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,874
Yes.

605
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,543
Dad, I need to go.
Yeon-hui, I'll see you later.

606
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,462
Where? You stayed out last night too.

607
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,297
-I have been summoned.
-By who? The chief?

608
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,548
No. Kim Mun-ho.

609
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,967
An informant came forward. Awesome.

610
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,678
-I'll be back.
-Hey, Yeong-sin!

611
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,597
Do I need a camera or a recorder?

612
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,640
Did you take your hat?

613
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,267
Don't forget your scarf!

614
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,768
The Gyeongmina Gate intersection?

615
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,813
Yes, I know where that is.

616
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,902
That building is vacant.
I'll leave the back door open.

617
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,236
Come to the roof.

618
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,324
And turn off the phone when you hang up,

619
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,201
so that you can't be tracked.

620
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,495
-Gyeongmina Gate intersection, please.
-Okay.

621
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,706
Turn it off right now. I'll see you there.

622
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,624
Okay.

623
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,348
What grade are you in?

624
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,666
Hello? Kim Mun-ho speaking.

625
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:20,671
"You must not forget the grace your family
showed you ever since you were a child."

626
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,297
Who is this?

627
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,300
"You must not betray family for a woman.

628
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,010
She is a bad woman.

629
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,846
Snap out of it and return home.

630
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,391
Everyone is waiting for you desperately."

631
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,106
CHAE YEONG-SIN

632
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,609
The phone is turned off--

633
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,694
Damn...

634
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,434
What?

635
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,269
Kim Mun-ho just emailed.

636
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,271
He says he can't reach Chae Yeong-sin.

637
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,607
Yeong-sin is at her home.

638
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,110
I called, and they said
she got a call and rushed out.

639
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,946
But they said the call
was from Kim Mun-ho.

640
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,239
What do you mean?

641
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,659
I think she fell for a voice manipulation.

642
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,752
By who? Why?

643
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,546
Kim Mun-ho said Boss sent a warning.

644
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,007
Boss? Who is Boss?

645
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:50,260
I don't know.
Kim Mun-ho is rushing over to his brother.

646
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,429
The tracker is still in Yeong-sin's bag.

647
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,223
That's her only bag.
She carries it everywhere.

648
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,850
I know. I'm tracing it now.

649
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,604
I'll send this to Kim Mun-ho too.

650
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,022
Whoever gets there sooner--

651
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:02,939
Where is it?

652
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,484
She's traveling toward Paju.

653
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,236
I need the receipt, please.
I have to claim it.

654
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,573
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

655
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,299
Where is the backdoor?

656
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,574
Mr. Kim.

657
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,076
Kim Mun-ho?

658
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,037
Hello!

659
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,791
Are you there? Hello?

660
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,286
This elevator is going up.

661
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,331
Floor 10.

662
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,962
Hello? The elevator broke down.

663
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,757
Hello? Is anyone there?

664
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,343
Hello? Can you hear me?

665
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,606
Help! I'm trapped in here!

666
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,527
Help! I'm trapped!

667
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,612
I'm trapped...

668
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,782
Help!

669
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,870
Help! I'm trapped!

670
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,590
You almost died! Are you crazy?

671
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,009
I know you get paid for this, but still...

672
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,354
Thank you for saving me, but...

673
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,482
I'm alive thanks to you, but...

674
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,195
If we fell together,
we both would have died.

675
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:30,947
What is this?

676
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,204
Are you still there?

677
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:48,923
You are, aren't you?

678
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,635
You're Healer, aren't you?

679
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,556
I don't know how much Mun-ho paid you,

680
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,060
but I owe you my life.

681
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,230
But I don't have money,

682
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,192
so I won't be able
to repay you with money.

683
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,487
I'm sorry.

684
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,199
And thank you.

685
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,394
Ever since I became alone,

686
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,064
I never wanted anything from human beings,

687
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,149
so I was fine.

688
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,997
I didn't care if anyone understood
or misunderstood me.

689
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,876
That's how I was.

690
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,885
Someone definitely messed with
the elevator.

691
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,429
You called me by a different name,
didn't you?

692
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:42,889
Ji-eun or something?

693
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,308
You decided not to be human anymore?

694
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,186
You shouldn't have touched Ji-an.

695
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,396
I thought if I waited like this,

696
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,983
he would appear like a ghost behind me.

697
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,401
But he isn't coming.

698
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,488
So, Ji-an is alive? You found her?

699
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,990
A famous reporter?

700
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,158
I'll do it.

701
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,453
Let's go get famous.
