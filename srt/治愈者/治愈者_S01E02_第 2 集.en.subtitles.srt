TODAY'S MENU

2
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,137
Dad always said

3
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,848
to make your second favorite thing
your occupation

4
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,642
and cherish what you love most as a hobby.

5
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,982
That is why my dad is a criminal attorney

6
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,193
who runs a cafe on the side.

7
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,988
He believes in going
the extra mile for both,

8
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,531
so his cafe below our residence

9
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,992
has always been packed with ex-cons.

10
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,918
Many of my dad's clients
have become his loyal fans.

11
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,047
They all visited my dad
after being released from prison

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,467
to ask for food or a job.

13
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,595
They stuck around
and eventually became my friends too.

14
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,100
My friends taught me a lot of things.

15
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,479
Things they never teach you in school.

16
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,415
Attagirl!

17
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,335
Jeez, she's a natural.

18
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,045
I knew it.

19
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,548
-Hello, sir.
-Hi, Yeong-sin.

20
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,634
-Sir.
-Hey. You're back early.

21
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,554
Isn't it clean?

22
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,683
-What?
-Here.

23
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,811
What about it? It's clean.

24
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,396
Hurry!

25
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,189
What?

26
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,607
Hey!

27
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,362
Are you kidding me?

28
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,872
Come on. Just one more bite.

29
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,458
What do you think?

30
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,336
It's called A Midsummer Night's Dream.

31
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,269
My friends were former gangsters,
thieves, and con artists,

32
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,981
and they also taught me
to trust my gut feeling.

33
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,609
I need to have eyes on the back of my head

34
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,195
and know if someone is watching me.

35
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,114
That way, I can escape.

36
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,375
Do it right the first time.

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,835
Don't get hair samples
without the root again

38
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,254
like last time, okay?

39
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,341
What would be ideal is to draw her blood

40
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,302
or scrape the inside of her cheek
with a cotton swab,

41
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,305
but that would be difficult even for you.

42
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,803
What do you mean I'm late?
I'm already at work.

43
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,431
Where else? I'm at the scene.

44
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,435
Where else would a reporter be
except at the scene of the news?

45
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,522
Boss, I haven't slept in two days.

46
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,440
I have sallow skin

47
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,359
and under-eye darkness
from a late-night stakeout.

48
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,611
My hair is disheveled and beyond help.

49
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,448
But what can I do?

50
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,118
I still attract men wherever I go.

51
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,162
I'm just too popular.

52
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,051
She must have noticed
that you're tailing her.

53
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,554
She's super perceptive which is annoying.

54
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,350
Should I just drag her into an alley
and draw some blood?

55
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,728
Her bag.

56
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,313
What?

57
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,814
Check out its size.

58
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,693
She's probably carrying toiletries,
so grab her toothbrush

59
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,611
or brush.

60
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,942
-Oh, no!
-Are you okay?

61
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,985
-Yes.
-Sir!

62
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,363
-You should have been more careful!
-I'm sorry.

63
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,698
-I can't believe this.
-I'm sorry.

64
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,700
Oh, dear. The fruits are damaged.

65
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,328
-I'm sorry.
-How am I supposed to sell these now?

66
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,248
Look where you're going from now on!

67
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,542
Something came flying towards me.

68
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,670
I can't sell these anymore.
What am I going to do?

69
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,005
-Oh, no.
-What a disaster.

70
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,465
How am I supposed to sell these?

71
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,134
-I couldn't help it.
-My gosh.

72
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,610
There's no brush.

73
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,706
What on earth is with this girl?

74
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,129
Hey, thief!

75
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,715
That's my bag

76
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,425
which makes you a thief.

77
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,136
I found him.

78
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,555
Second-floor men's room
of Dongsin Building.

79
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,065
I locked him in, so hurry up.

80
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,943
Isn't there a policeman patrolling nearby?

81
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,970
Keep it down.

82
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,223
Hey...

83
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,682
Hush.

84
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,601
It hurts.

85
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,496
No...

86
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,290
Miss.

87
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,335
Move and I'll hurt you.

88
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,946
Don't ever follow anyone blindly again.

89
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,991
It may cost you your life.

90
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,205
Long time no see.

91
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,377
Take a look at my Benny.
Doesn't she look different?

92
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,756
I touched it up.

93
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,382
What do you think? Isn't it awesome?

94
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,472
So, I was thinking,
since I fixed up Benny and all,

95
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,099
can't you put in a good word
with the boss?

96
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,481
I know I'm nowhere near your level
when it comes to the job,

97
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,441
but I can take on an easy one!

98
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,568
Instead of lousy delivery jobs,

99
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,529
give me something decent
and I'll prove myself.

100
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,411
Shit!

101
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,462
Just tell her to give me a shot.

102
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,925
After she sees me in action,
she can decide whether...

103
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,302
I'll take something simple. Please?

104
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,097
Drive safely.

105
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,267
Hey!

106
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,145
Come on!

107
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,462
LOCKER 08
PASSCODE 0808

108
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,576
Hello, Mun-ho.

109
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,089
-Hello.
-Where have you been?

110
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,304
There.

111
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,891
Suseong Industries called.

112
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,186
Have you been meeting
its retired employees?

113
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,103
Me?

114
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,438
Don't bother.

115
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,523
There's no point.

116
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,151
-I won't air it.
-But it's super fun.

117
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,486
You, I mean...

118
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,989
Chief Kang, you'll be hooked
once you hear this.

119
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,949
The interview I led yesterday--

120
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,117
Do you know

121
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,537
how many commercials we get from Suseong?

122
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,832
Do you know how much money that is?

123
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,335
Your salary comes from there too.

124
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,296
I know, and I'm always grateful.

125
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,673
The station has been struggling lately.

126
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,217
It isn't how it used to be.

127
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,094
- One commercial--
-That's odd.

128
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,015
Why is the head of Special Feature News
worried about commercials?

129
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,353
Our advertising department
has plenty of skilled people.

130
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,647
Leave it to them

131
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,690
and stick to your own job.

132
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,111
I've chased this story
for over three months.

133
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,407
If you give me more time,
I'll have three hours' worth of news.

134
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,452
-I have solid interviews, and--
-Is being popular that important?

135
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,748
I know every time you're on TV,
social media blows up.

136
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,501
"A rare progressive reporter of our time."

137
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,753
"Always on the side of the weak."

138
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,673
"He's even good-looking."

139
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:06,971
The more fans and applause you gain,
the more you get swept away.

140
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,058
You're addicted to being popular.

141
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,935
-"I'm addicted to being popular"?
-Yes.

142
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,354
You can't control yourself.

143
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,066
You want more and more applause.

144
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,777
Those who applaud you though

145
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,948
will leave you
over something inconsequential.

146
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,994
Easily too.

147
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,287
They won't just leave me.

148
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,957
They will step on me,
tear me apart, and bury me.

149
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,501
-Mun-ho.
-That's when I'll stop.

150
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,253
When they leave me.

151
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,881
I have nothing to do if not this.

152
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,801
Anyway, is this a new outfit?

153
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,138
Are you seeing someone?

154
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,057
You're glowing these days.

155
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,979
It hurts your ex-boyfriend
to see you this way.

156
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,869
I got everything from the archives,
but the statistics are from two years ago.

157
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,204
-What about last year's?
-I can't find them.

158
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,164
I want last year's.

159
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,834
Okay, I'll look again.

160
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,503
-Jong-su.
-Yes?

161
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,256
I have a favor to ask.

162
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,259
On your way home,

163
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,221
take this to the lab from before.

164
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,598
You know my friend there, right?

165
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,767
-Again?
-Yes.

166
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,437
They have a sample for comparison,
so just hand this to him.

167
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,527
-This DNA testing...
-I told you, it's a secret.

168
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,156
Who are you searching for?

169
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,493
Do you...

170
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,577
Do I what?

171
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,580
Never mind.

172
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,250
There's a case I'm investigating.

173
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,045
I see.

174
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,005
What is it?

175
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,841
I'll include you when I know more.

176
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,177
Really? That's a promise.

177
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,597
If you go back on your word,
I'll talk shit about you.

178
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,644
Will you be okay though?

179
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,104
About what?

180
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,648
I heard the high-ups are furious.

181
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,026
A written apology
may not suffice this time.

182
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,654
-The statistics.
-Sorry?

183
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,240
-Last year's statistics.
-On it, sir.

184
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,161
MYEONG-HUI

185
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,335
Mun-ho.

186
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,256
Do I need to officially invite you
to see your face?

187
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,968
There you go again,
exaggerating everything.

188
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,931
I know you're busy,
but let's eat together once a week.

189
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,684
What do you say, Mr. Hotshot Reporter?

190
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,229
I hope this will stop your nagging.

191
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,274
Chin cactus!

192
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,945
It's pretty.

193
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,201
What's on the menu? Can I help?

194
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,496
I got some porcini mushrooms

195
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,331
and some nice veal too.

196
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,917
I'm making wine sauce for the steak.

197
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,837
Can you wash vegetables for the salad?

198
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,213
Sure.

199
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,842
I smell...

200
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:37,639
tomatoes, cheese, and potatoes
being baked in the oven.

201
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,769
It's a gratin, so take some home later.

202
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,063
You can heat it up for a meal.

203
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,238
My dear sister.

204
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,449
What?

205
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,035
Leave your husband
and go to Seoul with me.

206
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,290
I'll get you a house
with an amazing kitchen.

207
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,585
What do you think? Come on.

208
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,297
First, stop calling her your dear sister.

209
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,471
It's been almost 20 years
since she became your sister-in-law.

210
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,932
Let him be.

211
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,310
If he addresses me formally,
I'll have to too.

212
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,479
I'll even have to use honorifics.

213
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,779
Are you staying the night?

214
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,406
I have to go back.

215
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,033
I have work to do.

216
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,121
I heard they hate you in the newsroom.

217
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,791
You mean by the ones who envy my fame?

218
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,877
I heard you went off script on air,

219
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,254
and it wasn't the first time.

220
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,425
Did you have dinner
with my station director?

221
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,760
Just quit already.

222
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,263
Come work for me,
and I'll give you a newsroom.

223
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,932
You can talk all you want.

224
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,019
Being the head of a cable channel
isn't so bad.

225
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,354
Should I?

226
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,982
It's true that having connections
is a skill too.

227
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,195
It's time for your sister-in-law's
medicine and nap.

228
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,489
She's been refusing her medication lately.

229
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,283
She doesn't like being drowsy.

230
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,265
You took your medicine,
and you're tucked in.

231
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,933
What next?

232
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,769
Tell me about your girlfriend.

233
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,189
That again?

234
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,150
Don't you still have one?

235
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,028
Give it up because I don't have one.

236
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,284
You're no fun.

237
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,672
Stay until I fall asleep.

238
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,633
Okay.

239
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,971
Just before I fall asleep
has been the toughest for me.

240
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,475
Too many thoughts run through my head.

241
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,729
I can tell you a funny story
to keep them out.

242
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,608
You're not good at telling them.

243
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,694
I could always tell a serious one.

244
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,696
Go ahead.

245
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,328
What was that novelist's name?
He's Chinese.

246
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,788
Tell me more.

247
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,249
Well...

248
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,379
"There are people locked in a steel room.

249
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,631
Everyone is asleep.

250
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,259
Soon, they will all suffocate to death.

251
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,095
But one of them woke up.

252
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,057
Should he wake up the others

253
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,226
to look for a way out together?"

254
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,437
"Since there is no way out anyway,

255
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,773
isn't it better to let them die peacefully
in their sleep?"

256
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,691
Right.

257
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,193
"If they wake up, they will be miserable."

258
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,611
That's it.

259
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,862
I think

260
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,407
it's from a preface, not a novel.

261
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,202
His name begins with the letter L.

262
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,288
Lu...

263
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,747
-Lu Xun!
-Lu Xun!

264
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,418
That's right, Lu Xun.

265
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,503
-But why?
-What?

266
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,797
Why did you think of that story?

267
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,217
Is there something you can't tell me?

268
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,305
Look,

269
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,183
the world doesn't always revolve
around you.

270
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,744
But isn't the media supposed to question
what's going on?

271
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,705
Yes, the media should question
and expose the truth.

272
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,000
If they don't question
or expose something suspicious,

273
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,376
When did you take off your seatbelt?

274
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,214
Buckle up!

275
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,774
Were you crying?

276
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,612
It's because you spilled your milk
after you begged your brother for it.

277
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,530
Right?

278
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,117
Mun-ho.

279
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,618
You can cry.

280
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,370
You can cry in front of me.

281
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,664
It'll be our little secret.

282
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,281
Arc de Triomphe by Remarque

283
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,335
Wouldn't it be better
to take care of them together?

284
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:50,674
It isn't easy to meet Healer,
and even if we do...

285
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,475
It's been taken care of.

286
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,060
Here.

287
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,646
Here is the item.

288
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,732
Is his name Healer?

289
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,442
So where is he?

290
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,279
We've tied him down for now.

291
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,239
What's the next step?

292
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,830
Wouldn't it be better
to take care of them together?

293
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,709
It isn't easy to meet Healer.

294
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,712
Even if we do, it won't be easy.

295
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,589
I heard that he's very skilled.

296
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,554
It's me.

297
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,597
Hey, Mun-ho. The results are out.

298
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,100
I didn't expect you

299
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,311
to call in person.

300
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,439
I can't tell you for free.

301
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,941
This normally takes over a week,

302
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,736
but I came to the lab to run it myself.

303
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,987
Tell me the result.

304
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,780
Whoever this is, congratulations.

305
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,866
Is this the fourth one?

306
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,368
The previous samples weren't a match.

307
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,206
The two samples are
a familial match of 99 percent.

308
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,710
They are both female,
so mother and daughter.

309
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,131
Mun-ho, are you still there?

310
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,050
Yes.

311
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,971
Am I right to assume
that this is good news?

312
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,565
I am a hired gun.

313
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,277
I started when I was 20,
so it's been eight years.

314
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,529
Excuse me.

315
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,323
Excuse me.

316
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,616
I'm pretty good too.

317
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,661
To be honest, I'm the best.
That's why I'm quite expensive.

318
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,457
I do anything except kill people.

319
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,337
I don't care about ethics or justice.

320
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,007
That is my principle toward my clients.

321
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:03,390
I don't care what the clients do
with the items I steal for them.

322
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,226
You can't call me a thief

323
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,605
just because I steal things
or wiretap people.

324
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,899
As I said earlier,

325
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,859
I'm just a man for hire.

326
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,206
Hi.

327
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,719
I only have three numbers
saved on my phone.

328
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:10,266
The lady who aids me, my gofer,
and my favorite chicken place.

329
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,481
I have no family, friends, or colleagues.

330
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,982
Why would I need them?

331
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,444
I honestly don't know.

332
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,937
MS. JO

333
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,110
MS. JO

334
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,611
SPEAKER

335
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,699
Hello.

336
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,410
Tell me the truth.

337
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,663
Do you have my house under surveillance?

338
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,875
You find joy interrupting my meals.

339
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,210
What you're eating isn't a meal.

340
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:23,923
Pig's feet and fried chicken
are just snacks or late-night snacks.

341
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,049
I knew it.

342
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,343
You installed cameras here.

343
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,304
You really did.

344
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,349
That girl must be the right one.

345
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,811
Did we get paid?

346
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,357
I love this client.
He pays almost immediately.

347
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,778
Anyway, our favorite client
sent a follow-up request.

348
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,574
What is it?

349
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,164
There are seven questions in total.

350
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,957
He wants you to look into each one.

351
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,835
How much are we getting paid?

352
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,588
A small bill for each question.

353
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:05,965
Nice.

354
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,139
Seriously?

355
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,354
First, her family.

356
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,190
Look into each family member,

357
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,859
including how they treated her as a child.

358
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:39,123
Those new glasses
have a shorter battery life

359
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,875
so charge them whenever you can.

360
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,093
Hello. Good morning.

361
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,811
Chae Yeong-sin.

362
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,438
She lives alone with her adoptive father.

363
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,107
His name is Chae Chi-su.

364
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,859
She was adopted at the age of eight.

365
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,406
Chae Chi-su was born in 1963
and is an attorney.

366
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,117
He runs a cafe on the side.

367
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,204
His law office is in the cafe. Really?

368
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,415
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

369
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,749
I see.

370
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,628
-Sir.
-Yes?

371
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,052
I'll have the breakfast set, please.

372
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,680
Which breakfast set?

373
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,141
The...

374
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,436
The first one. Set A.

375
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,187
Set A.

376
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,523
That will be 6,000 won.

377
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,400
How would you like your eggs?

378
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,235
What?

379
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,947
Fried, scrambled, or hard-boiled?

380
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,244
I want the first one, fried.

381
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,289
Okay, fried.

382
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,083
I found a newspaper article.

383
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,128
Chae Chi-su is known
for taking care of his clients

384
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,214
even after they are released from prison.

385
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,301
He even holds barista classes for them
every weekend

386
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,969
and helps them find jobs.

387
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,764
Six.

388
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,156
I have the records of the guy
who took your order.

389
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,494
PERSONAL INFORMATION

390
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,164
He has three priors
for pickpocketing and burglary

391
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,958
and was released from prison
seven years ago.

392
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,376
He's been working there ever since.

393
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:54,300
So, Chae Yeong-sin's adoptive father
is her only family.

394
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,594
Her adoptive mother passed away in 2001.

395
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,597
Dad.

396
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,809
I'm having a shitty day today.

397
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,436
Because of that psycho thief,

398
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,940
I had nightmares all night
and almost went crazy.

399
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,609
Let's not start the day with gloomy music.

400
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,986
This isn't gloomy. This is "Thirsty."

401
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,909
Give me some water

402
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,163
Give me some water

403
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:29,252
I am thirsty

404
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,089
Give me some water

405
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,927
Water is love

406
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,932
It tickles my throat

407
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,394
And teases me

408
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,606
And sends me out

409
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,651
Oh, I will leave

410
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,822
I will leave

411
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:06,747
I will cross that hill

412
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,544
If I meet a woman

413
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:16,507
During my trip

414
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,178
I will live

415
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,390
I will live with her

416
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,538
WAS SHE ABUSED AS A CHILD?

417
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:53,252
HIGHLY UNLIKELY

418
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,801
Give me some water

419
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,273
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,161
Second, her job.

421
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,206
Is she good at it? What is her work style?

422
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,211
The number is 3389 5425.

423
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,172
It must be around here somewhere.

424
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,132
Chae Yeong-sin.

425
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,093
A reporter at an Internet newspaper...

426
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,761
She's a reporter at Someday News.

427
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,513
How are her skills?

428
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,597
Ms. Jo.

429
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,600
Are you sure she's a reporter?

430
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,643
Why?

431
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,232
She acts like a petty car thief.

432
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,608
A complete rookie too.

433
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,610
Jeez.

434
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,405
Security cameras and black boxes

435
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,907
don't seem to exist in her eyes.

436
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,258
Hey.

437
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,844
Brush your hair for crying out loud.

438
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,809
And put on some lipstick!

439
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,131
Lee Jun-bin?

440
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,524
Excuse me! Can you open this?

441
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,318
Damn it.

442
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,408
Access denied.

443
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,492
What?

444
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,041
Thank you.

445
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,968
Right, ninth floor. I knew it.

446
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,970
You got off on the ninth floor!

447
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,222
I knew it. I got you this time.

448
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,920
Fifth floor.

449
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,132
Doors opening.

450
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,303
Aren't you getting off?

451
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,146
Doors closing.

452
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,402
Ninth floor.

453
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,744
Doors closing.

454
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:01,977
I think she left work early
to follow a guy.

455
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,564
She acts like a total stalker.

456
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:10,861
Just so you know, I got the chills
while watching her earlier.

457
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,113
I'm telling you,

458
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,367
women like her scare me
more than serial killers.

459
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,618
I can't stand them.

460
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,454
Let's see. She's 11m above me.

461
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,291
She's not on the sixth floor.
Right, she's on the ninth.

462
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,961
Should I see who lives there?

463
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,671
Like I said, it's a guy.

464
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,215
He's a poor soul
being stalked by a weirdo.

465
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,425
We need to see just how bad it is.

466
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,426
Ms. Jo.

467
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,595
Do I really have to see that?

468
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,473
Seeing isn't enough.
You have to record it.

469
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,433
Okay.

470
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,144
Unbelievable.

471
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,819
Who is it?

472
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,154
I'm from Sinsa Precinct.

473
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,782
We're investigating a burglary
in the neighborhood.

474
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,411
Could you open the door?

475
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,214
This is Officer Park Yeong-ja.
I'm at unit 903 in complex three.

476
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,009
The resident won't cooperate.
What should I do?

477
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,094
Hold on. Let me get dressed.

478
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,393
Going up.

479
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,312
Ninth floor.

480
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,149
Doors closing.

481
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,081
Doors closing.

482
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,795
Where is the woman?

483
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,591
Did you see the owner of that purse?

484
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,935
Doors closing.

485
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,440
She better be there.

486
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,738
Doors closing.

487
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,243
I almost had them. Of all the luck...

488
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,456
25th floor.

489
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,421
Shit. What do I do?

490
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,468
Excuse me, miss.

491
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,682
Wait! Hold on!

492
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,185
Hello, miss.

493
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,231
I need to tell you something,
so please talk to me.

494
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,650
What I need to say is...

495
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:38,944
This purse.

496
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,112
This is yours, right?

497
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,114
It looks nice, but it was in the elevator.

498
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,825
Wait! Stop!

499
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,577
Don't do that.

500
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,829
Talk to me.

501
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,041
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

502
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,128
So, please turn around and look at me.

503
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:01,842
You know,

504
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,970
I've stood there before too.

505
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,056
I was seven.

506
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,851
When I was seven,

507
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,439
I stood there too

508
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,527
because everyone I knew then

509
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,863
left me.

510
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:26,992
My mom

511
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,745
and my dad

512
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,664
abandoned me.

513
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,585
I was found next to a dumpster
when I was five.

514
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,004
From there,

515
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,841
I moved to five different orphanages.

516
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,762
I was adopted, then abandoned.

517
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,182
I was adopted again

518
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,559
but only to be beaten up.

519
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,145
So...

520
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,649
It was too painful.

521
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,153
It hurt so much that I wanted to die.

522
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,533
A seven-year-old

523
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,370
thought that it wouldn't hurt

524
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,872
if she jumped.

525
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,547
Do you remember when you were seven?

526
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,342
Most people don't.

527
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:30,097
But I remember everything so clearly.

528
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,558
It was cold

529
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,686
like today.

530
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,772
It was winter.

531
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,153
Where I got hit hurt like crazy.

532
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,452
I had a few broken ribs.

533
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,459
But you know what?

534
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,964
It doesn't hurt anymore.

535
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,134
That's how it is.

536
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,636
It all passes.

537
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,518
Just hang in there,

538
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,062
and it too will pass.

539
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,321
Trust me.

540
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,532
It will all pass.

541
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,577
I know

542
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,705
because I've been there.

543
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,863
Why did you turn it off?

544
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,074
We got enough.

545
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,451
But the client--

546
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,974
My mom

547
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,727
and my dad

548
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,563
abandoned me.

549
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,359
I was found next to a dumpster
when I was five.

550
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,709
It was winter.

551
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,714
Where I got hit hurt like crazy.

552
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,468
I had a few broken ribs.

553
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,099
Did Myeong-hui lend this to you?

554
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,060
Then I'll wash it and give it back to her.

555
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,146
That's good manners.

556
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,349
You're unbelievable.

557
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,309
What?

558
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,894
I'm not going to kiss you.

559
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,687
-Check that out.
-What is it?

560
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,773
-That over there.
-What?

561
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,360
-Stop it.
-I just missed you.

562
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,112
-Stop it.
-Why?

563
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,906
Stop fooling around.

564
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:01,284
I'm not doing anything I shouldn't do.

565
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,063
FORENSIC SCIENCE

566
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,411
Excuse me. Can I help you?

567
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,919
"Cyber Crime Division".

568
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,256
-What brings a detective here?
-So...

569
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:00,427
the victim was thrown out
from a train passing by up there?

570
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,889
You don't know yet
if he was alive at the time.

571
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,308
-How do you know that?
-I read the report.

572
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,770
It says that
there was something in his pocket.

573
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,439
A memo.

574
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,400
-That's correct.
-May I see it?

575
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,946
But we submitted the report
less than two hours ago.

576
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,615
How come there's already
someone from Seoul--

577
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,909
It's been two hours and 40 minutes.
Let me see it.

578
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,128
Fucking hell.

579
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,422
Hold on a second!

580
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,132
This is evidence.

581
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,551
We don't know if this was suicide or not,

582
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,303
so it may be an important lead.

583
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,888
-It's Healer.
-Pardon?

584
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,142
This is Healer's e-mail address.

585
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,978
I've been chasing him for over five years,

586
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,898
so help me out a little.

587
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:15,835
The client must be very satisfied
with what we sent.

588
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,463
He said we can forget
the rest of the questions

589
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,006
and just look into one thing.

590
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,716
That is...

591
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,094
Well, it's...

592
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,055
What is it?

593
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,474
It's actually quite corny.

594
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,185
Still, it's what the client wants.

595
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,815
-What?
-"What is Chae Yeong-sin's dream?

596
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,986
What does she desperately wish for?"

597
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,362
He wants you to find that out.

598
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,156
Good God.

599
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,659
My choice of words weren't as nice.

600
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,162
You can look into that.

601
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,124
Girls take pictures
of every little thing they eat

602
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,209
and post them on their blogs.

603
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,754
She must have blabbed
about her dream somewhere.

604
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,131
I already told you.

605
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:05,719
She doesn't have any anything.
No social media accounts, no blogs.

606
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,430
Hey, Healer.

607
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,266
What if you went on a blind date with her?

608
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,643
You can easily ask her then.

609
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,021
"So, what is your dream?

610
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,148
What's your name?

611
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,233
What's your number?"

612
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,902
Ms. Jo, snap out of it.

613
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,876
What do you plan to do?

614
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:41,046
I plan to work since I want to make money.

615
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,027
What are you looking for?

616
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:47,862
Something like a journal.

617
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,282
Who writes a journal these days?

618
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,546
Here you go. You can start with a bath.

619
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,757
Take out a new toothbrush
and use whatever products you want.

620
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,592
I'll bring you a change of clothes.

621
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,063
INVESTIGATION REPORT

622
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,482
A MAN WAS FOUND DEAD...

623
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,317
KO SEONG-CHEOL WITH A MAN...

624
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,796
Pink is probably better.

625
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,049
Where is the new underwear?

626
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,885
It's around here somewhere.

627
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,429
Here it is.

628
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,490
Healer, you're wanted by the police.

629
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,659
I've been wanted for years.

630
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,246
This time, you're a suspect in a murder.

631
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,584
-Why?
-Ko Seong-cheol is dead.

632
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:28,963
How?

633
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,798
Let's wrap up and stay low for a while.

634
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:32,800
Wrap it up.

635
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,179
What are you doing? Get out.

636
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,515
-I can't.
-Why not?

637
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,808
I need to stay with her a little longer.

638
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,770
What are you talking about?
You're a murder suspect.

639
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,104
You said to find out her dream.

640
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,234
The client wants to know
what her real dream is.

641
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,280
Then, I should stick to her like glue

642
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,450
in order to figure it out.

643
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,008
The back of my head keeps tingling lately.

644
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,634
It feels like I'm being followed.

645
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,928
Why does she have my picture?

646
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,805
Is she a bait to catch me?

647
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,641
This is Kim Mun-ho. Don't you know him?

648
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,185
You want to be taken
seriously as a reporter.

649
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,606
This reporter is hiding
the possible female victim.

650
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,232
That's why he wrote it
with such confidence.

651
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,652
Look into him.
He's probably hiding that woman.

652
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,404
I believe in such things.

653
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,115
Fate, destiny, and things like that.

654
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,533
Life just used to be bland.

655
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,368
But it's about to get interesting.
