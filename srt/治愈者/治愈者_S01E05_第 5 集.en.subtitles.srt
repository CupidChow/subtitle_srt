1
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,423
You seem rather familiar.

2
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,178
Aren't you that punk
my boss is dying to meet?

3
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,245
Until we meet again, punk.

4
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,736
How many?

5
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,698
Two.

6
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,209
Miss, are you all right?

7
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,794
Are you the one who called the police?

8
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,423
Oh, gosh.

9
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,726
Where is the guy who called?

10
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,060
Excuse me?

11
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,896
Park Bong-suk.

12
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,523
Is he alive?

13
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,899
Bong-suk!

14
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,651
Park Bong-su!

15
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,695
Was someone else assaulted?

16
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,530
Do you want to make a report
at the station

17
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,157
-or keep looking?
-Bong-su!

18
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,124
Dad, is Bong-su there?

19
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,795
He disappeared,
and I don't have his number.

20
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,338
-Excuse me, miss.
-Dad.

21
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,424
Is Ms. Joo okay?

22
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,386
Stay with her, Dad. I'll be right home.

23
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,180
Okay.

24
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,640
Where did he go?

25
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,517
Are you sure there were gang members?

26
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,770
-You need to tell me what was going on.
-Just a minute.

27
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,229
My colleague disappeared.

28
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,482
Are you reporting a kidnapping,
not an assault?

29
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,566
Bong-suk!

30
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,068
Park Bong-su!

31
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,070
Park Bong-su!

32
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,489
Bong-suk!

33
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,618
Park Bong-su!

34
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,204
Where did he go?

35
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,747
Bong-su!

36
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,417
Park Bong-su!

37
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,462
My gosh.

38
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,049
Park Bong-su!

39
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,721
MINION

40
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:34,227
The reporter got here an hour ago
and had dinner with some woman.

41
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,686
Now he's doing the dishes.

42
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,231
Gosh, I'm starving.

43
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,150
So, is this where he lives?

44
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,402
Reporters must make a lot of money.

45
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,695
This house is...

46
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,249
As always, you still make too much food.

47
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,752
I do tend to make a lot.

48
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,880
We have more leftovers than usual,
because your brother didn't come.

49
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,009
You always make an extra serving,
don't you?

50
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,848
Just pretend you don't notice that.

51
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,559
I'm not sure
if I can bring this up, but...

52
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,770
-About the girl...
-You mean, about Ji-an?

53
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,524
May I?

54
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,539
Should I not?

55
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,916
No?

56
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,794
I was just wondering

57
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,922
how old Ji-an would be or what kind
of job she would have if she were alive.

58
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,801
Can we talk about things like that?

59
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,351
Myeong-hui.

60
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,270
She'd turn 28 on her next birthday.

61
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,480
Also...

62
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,403
No, I don't know what she would be doing
if she were alive.

63
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,531
I have no idea what kind of food
she would like.

64
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,787
If she were alive,

65
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,415
she could've become
a reporter like you and Gil-han.

66
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,417
Kids follow their parents' footsteps--

67
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,012
Ji-an is dead.

68
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,515
I was just saying, what if--

69
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,100
How could I not know if she were alive?

70
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,063
That's not possible.

71
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,775
Okay. You're right.

72
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,486
How could a mother not know
whether her daughter is alive or not?

73
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:50,863
That's enough.

74
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,282
How could I possibly have lived
all these years like this

75
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,409
had I known that she was alive?

76
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,828
That means she lived without a mom

77
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,165
not just for a year or two

78
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,502
but for over twenty years...

79
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,130
Meanwhile...

80
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,675
I have been living

81
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,718
in great comfort

82
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,347
and ease. How am I supposed to...

83
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,224
I just can't...

84
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,814
Myeong-hui.

85
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,734
Myeong-hui, I'm sorry.

86
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,321
I'm sorry. Don't think about it, okay?

87
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,698
Please.

88
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,032
Myeong-hui, please.

89
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,618
Myeong-hui, don't think about it.

90
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,536
-Myeong-hui!
-Please.

91
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,620
-Please.
-Move away.

92
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,956
Myeong-hui, are you okay?

93
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,165
Myeong-hui.

94
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,751
Calm down.

95
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,838
I said something I shouldn't have.
I was just...

96
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,134
Wait outside.

97
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,733
Myeong-hui, calm down.

98
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,908
Myeong-hui, can you hear me?

99
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,904
So, you are saying that I won't be able
to protect my story or my source, right?

100
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,533
That's why you want me to give it to...

101
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,702
May I speak casually to you?

102
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,206
I guess not.

103
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:11,170
Mr. Kim, you are asking me
to hand over my source to you.

104
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,505
Why should I?

105
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,176
That source is probably
in danger right now.

106
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,138
Can't you tell whether or not
she's in danger?

107
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,142
You don't understand
what is going on, do you?

108
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,063
You have no clue what you've done
or how things are going turn out,

109
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,190
do you?

110
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,781
I'm your fan.

111
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,158
No, I practically obsess over you.

112
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,454
You exposed Seongu Foundation's slush fund

113
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,206
and made the chairman resign.

114
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,376
You also covered
the offshore tax evasion cases.

115
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,672
You uncovered BM International's
stock market manipulation

116
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,049
and made the prime minister resign.

117
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,843
I've been following your reports
since college.

118
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,679
I even memorize some of your stories
word for word.

119
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,097
Did you really...

120
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,934
investigate them yourself?

121
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,562
Or did you find gullible reporters like me

122
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,772
and force them
to hand you over their stories?

123
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,528
But you did go to Iraq
during the war, didn't you?

124
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,322
You went there yourself
to cover the story about a girl

125
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,741
whose whole family was massacred
during the war, right?

126
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,954
When I saw that report,
I was so impressed and moved--

127
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,039
-Chae Yeong-sin.
-Yes?

128
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,834
I don't know if you wrote that article

129
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,795
because you didn't know the implication
of your action

130
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,214
or you were trying to be brave.

131
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,926
But if you can't handle it,

132
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,097
come to me.

133
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,898
REPORTER, KIM MUN-HO

134
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,824
You know, random thoughts cross your mind
when you can't sleep.

135
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,036
You see.

136
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,041
You have no idea how many times
I dreamed of this moment,

137
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,504
of receiving your business card
in person like this.

138
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,341
It was my fantasy.

139
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,057
She reminded me of you back in the day.

140
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,935
Her determined eyes and voice

141
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,811
are exactly like yours.

142
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,115
How...

143
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,326
is she doing?

144
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,287
Let's talk inside.

145
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,227
What did you say to her?

146
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,106
What made her react like that?

147
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,482
What did Dr. Oh say?

148
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,901
I heard she had a checkup

149
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,196
last week.

150
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,745
It's been the same for 20 years.

151
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,375
We saw the physiatrist, neurologist,
and psychiatrist

152
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,377
and returned with a huge bag of pills.

153
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,881
What happened?

154
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,425
She was fine for a while.

155
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,887
She didn't have an episode for months.

156
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,975
Tell me.

157
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,981
I got a call two months ago

158
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,692
that we needed to move

159
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,321
Ji-an's grave.

160
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,409
You told her that?

161
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,661
Not yet.

162
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,289
I was going to tell her
once it was taken care of,

163
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,083
but I changed my mind after hearing this.

164
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,379
I heard the grave was empty.

165
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,049
Her grave...

166
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,054
There were only a few rocks in the casket.

167
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,940
Weren't you the one

168
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,485
who put her to rest?

169
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,490
Is she really dead?

170
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,368
Or

171
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,079
did you lie to Myeong-hui

172
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,540
about Ji-an's death?

173
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,043
Ji-an is dead.

174
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,587
-What if she's alive?
-She's dead.

175
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,800
You know how hard it was
for Myeong-hui to accept that

176
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,429
and how hard it was for me
to help her to pull herself together.

177
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,932
So...

178
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,853
Ji-an can't be alive.

179
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,607
She can't be alive?

180
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,238
How can you say that?

181
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,155
Does it mean

182
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,160
that if she were alive,

183
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,080
you'd kill her all over again?

184
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,873
How could you say that?

185
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,166
Is that what you did

186
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,503
twenty-three years ago?

187
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,506
Is that what you did to Gil-han?

188
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,884
Because you couldn't have him alive?

189
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,803
Do I need to remind you of the accident?

190
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,722
Do you have to hear it again?

191
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,307
Was it really an accident?

192
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,313
Was it?

193
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,402
What if you find out about the truth?

194
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,529
Mun-sik.

195
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,699
What difference would it make
whether you know

196
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,993
the truth or not?

197
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,455
You can't do anything anyway.

198
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,417
What did you do?

199
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,421
What did you do to those people?

200
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,799
It's as you guessed.

201
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,177
What am I guessing?

202
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,346
You know everything about me.

203
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,849
Right, except for one thing.

204
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,606
Did you think

205
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,151
I would never read a book

206
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,321
like Arch of Triumph?

207
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,576
You know everything
that happened in this room,

208
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,537
and yet,

209
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,541
you have done nothing about it.

210
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,128
You've never stopped me

211
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,756
nor reported me to the police.

212
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,676
You've never even reported it on the news.

213
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,223
Because there is no point.

214
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,266
Mun-ho,

215
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,062
that means your hands aren't clean
in this.

216
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,273
You and I,

217
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,068
from 1992 until today,

218
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,570
have been in this together.

219
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,246
Are you still in denial?

220
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,303
-Damn.
-What are you up to?

221
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,978
You normally exercise at this hour
when you're not on the job.

222
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,648
If you're not busy,

223
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,360
let's think about the situation we are in.

224
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,947
First off, Bae Sang-su's guys
know that you are Healer.

225
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,865
Right?

226
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,038
Sang-su must have heard about it by now.
I'm sure he's wracking his brain.

227
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,333
"What? Healer showed up? Why? Where?"

228
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,544
"Next to that girl named Chae Yeong-sin."

229
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,173
I know. I lost my mind
and did something stupid.

230
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,508
I admit it. Are you happy now?

231
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:41,388
So, what would he be ordering
his guys to do now?

232
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,768
I'm positive.

233
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,854
It was him.

234
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,398
According to our guys,

235
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:56,153
he looked just like the guy who showed up
on the subway last time.

236
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,282
Is she the one he was protecting?

237
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,452
It looked like
there was something going on between them.

238
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,371
Like what? Is she his girlfriend or wife?

239
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,957
Are they just friends

240
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,417
or do they fool around with each other?

241
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,919
We don't know that yet.

242
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,296
Name.

243
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,381
Chae Yeong-sin.
She's a reporter at Someday News.

244
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,760
That article you told us
to take care of...

245
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,304
-Did she write that?
-Yes, sir.

246
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,391
This is interesting.

247
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,229
Finally, I'm getting the whole picture.

248
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,730
All right, then.

249
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,655
-Find out everything about her.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,115
Get moving.

251
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:50,540
Sang-su's will have his guys
lurk around her

252
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,376
in order to get to you.

253
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,002
That's a given, right?

254
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,255
Then what should you do?

255
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,259
There is nothing to consider.

256
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:05,430
You should stay away from her
no matter what.

257
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,434
Don't even look in her direction.

258
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,479
I'm sure Sang-su's goons
are looking into her

259
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,232
including her job, home, family,

260
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,277
down to her report cards
from grade school.

261
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,072
How far do Sang-su's goons go?

262
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,198
What do you mean?

263
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,243
When they get a job request,

264
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:31,290
do they go as far as
kidnapping and blackmailing?

265
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,960
They are a legitimate business on paper,

266
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,547
but I highly doubt
that they could buy that building

267
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,883
only by taking legitimate and legal jobs.

268
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,802
What if...

269
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,434
This is really just hypothetical.

270
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,894
Those guys...

271
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,773
If I don't ever show up,

272
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,776
they will want to ask Yeong-sin directly
about my whereabouts.

273
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,866
So, just how far would they...

274
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,203
Would they kidnap her, lock her up,

275
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,500
and go as far as torturing her?

276
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,170
Hey, Healer.

277
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,298
What do you think?
Are they capable of such things?

278
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,551
Do you like her that much?

279
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,017
She looks pretty in the photos.

280
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,895
Is she prettier in person? Is she sexy?

281
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:39,107
Seriously, have you suddenly
gone off your rocker?

282
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,862
You should have fled earlier,
but you ran to her.

283
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,575
Even now, when trouble
is knocking at your door,

284
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,578
you're still worried about her.

285
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,246
-Ms. Jo.
-Is she that pretty?

286
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,833
Just don't.

287
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,255
You're a fugitive and a murder suspect.

288
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,509
I thought you wanted to move
to a deserted island.

289
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,677
Don't fall for her
unless you think she'll go with you.

290
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,389
No matter how pretty she is,
don't bother starting anything.

291
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,491
When we humans see chimpanzees or tigers,

292
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,701
we don't care much about how they look.

293
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,079
It's not easy for us to tell

294
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,873
whether one chimpanzee or tiger
is prettier than others.

295
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,836
To me, human beings are the same.

296
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,963
They are all alike.

297
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,299
But...

298
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,302
this girl is a little different.

299
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,388
How is she different?

300
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,435
She's like a panther
from a documentary I saw.

301
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,356
It had a broken leg,
but came across a pack of hyenas.

302
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,776
Being hurt and outnumbered,
it didn't stand a chance.

303
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,698
However, it attacked them first
and refused to back down.

304
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,202
Hey, thief!

305
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,746
That's my bag

306
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,498
which makes you a thief.

307
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:22,961
I'll...

308
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,673
distract them, so you run.

309
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,633
She is just like that panther.

310
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,553
She isn't fearless because she's clueless.

311
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,348
She's still brave
even in the face of danger.

312
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,730
I cried a lot after I watched
that documentary.

313
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,982
I'm getting choked up
just thinking about it.

314
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,112
Anyway, I'm like that too.

315
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,908
I'm not the type to run away or hide.

316
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,624
MINION

317
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,210
MINION

318
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,184
Beasts are afraid to fight other beasts.

319
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,977
Any of them would feel scared.

320
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:25,857
However, whoever shows fear first
loses its life.

321
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:31,947
So, if anyone is after you, attack first
before they see your weakness.

322
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,827
That is how you survive in the wild.

323
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:50,840
There.

324
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,802
The big guy is Oh Yong-sik.

325
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,638
He's Bae Sang-su's third in command.

326
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,146
The guy up there playing with a toy
goes by the name "Yoyo."

327
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,856
He's Bae Sang-su's right-hand man.

328
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,234
You seem to know a lot about them.

329
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,238
I've been following them for years now.

330
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:18,285
They officially set up the company
and even have business cards.

331
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,830
But if I dig,
I'm sure I'll find a slew of things.

332
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,334
In other words,
you haven't been able to dig deep enough.

333
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,669
What?

334
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,174
Sang-su's hackers are so good

335
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,052
that even the Pentagon wants them.

336
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,223
If you look on the bright side,

337
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,643
they are laying low right now

338
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,688
because we're watching them.

339
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,274
We found something interesting

340
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,526
while looking for information
on that Someday reporter.

341
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,197
It's about the first job
you asked me to do.

342
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:01,494
You asked me to find Healer
and get rid of him, right?

343
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,415
I think he is related to this reporter
in some way.

344
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,002
So, this is what I assume.

345
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,714
You said that the reporter
wrote something troubling.

346
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,844
I think she and Healer are connected--

347
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,013
-Mr. Bae.
-Yes, sir.

348
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,890
Don't assume anything.

349
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,391
Pardon?

350
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,269
You don't need to make assumptions.

351
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,522
Just do what you're told.

352
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,233
Yes, sir.

353
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,777
I'm sorry, sir.

354
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,696
So, did you find out
where Joo Yeon-hui is hiding?

355
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,449
I'm positive the Someday reporter knows.

356
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,992
We are keeping a close eye on her.

357
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,369
What about Healer?

358
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,914
We found a way to draw him out,
so we'll get rid of him soon.

359
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,626
Do it, and call me once it's done.

360
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,051
The major papers agreed to cooperate,

361
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,637
and TV stations are on board too.

362
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,015
Still, it will be difficult
to completely cover it up.

363
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:09,646
Small Internet sites and podcasts
may keep following the story.

364
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,980
What can they do?

365
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,400
It's not so simple.

366
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,778
The mayoral candidate of Seoul
took sexual bribes

367
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,363
from a construction company president.

368
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,117
The victim filed charges with the police.

369
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,453
I heard that the minority party
has started an investigation.

370
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,497
It'll be impossible
to sweep under the rug.

371
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,124
You said they were small.

372
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,253
Do you know why they remain insignificant?

373
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,172
It's because they can't join together.

374
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,719
They don't know
how to make their voice heard.

375
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,971
That's why they can't do anything

376
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,975
other than remain insignificant.

377
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,476
Don't you agree?

378
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,187
Yes, sir.

379
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,022
Next.

380
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,191
It's about Bongjin Life Insurance.

381
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,694
I heard from the Prosecutors' Office...

382
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,238
-But...
-Pardon?

383
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,574
The name was Healer, right?

384
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,494
Do you mean the courier?

385
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,665
It's a very familiar name.

386
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,460
That's what they called him

387
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,129
a long time ago.

388
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,445
How many?

389
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,449
Don't ever follow anyone blindly again.

390
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,535
It may cost you your life.

391
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,168
It's him.

392
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,337
That's the guy. It's Healer.

393
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,341
But why did he help me?

394
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,092
Why me?

395
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,469
Why?

396
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,847
Wait!

397
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,183
I told you not to go near the window.

398
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,477
They may have followed me.

399
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,604
Look who's outside.

400
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,605
Is someone here?

401
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,483
I knew it. What should we do?

402
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,109
I bet those thugs are here.

403
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,778
No, it's that man.

404
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,404
Pardon?

405
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,015
Chi-su!

406
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,188
Hurry up and come in.

407
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,024
Chi-su.

408
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,573
I'm sorry.

409
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,283
Hey, Bong-su.

410
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,159
Yeong-sin.

411
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,579
I'm sorry.

412
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,998
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

413
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,208
I'm okay.

414
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,878
But...

415
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,923
I ran away first.

416
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,051
You asked me to protect her,

417
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,888
but I was so scared.

418
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,141
Besides, there was nothing I could do.

419
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,853
Anyway, when I came to my senses,

420
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,607
I found myself running away alone.

421
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,404
Didn't you say he got beat up?

422
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,072
I did.

423
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,409
Didn't you pass out after you got beat up?

424
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,164
You're right. I got hit here and...

425
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,416
Let me see.

426
00:31:59,125 --> 00:31:59,959
Sorry?

427
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,797
Here. And they hit me here, too...

428
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,216
Wait...

429
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,930
Well, my armpits are pretty sensitive.

430
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,514
He seems fine.

431
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,018
But why were you sleeping outside?

432
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:18,978
Oh, that?

433
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:24,525
I was worried about her,
but didn't want to wake her up.

434
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:30,073
I kept wondering what to do,
and I felt sleepy, so--

435
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,908
What happened to your hand?

436
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,745
I don't know.

437
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,832
I may have been hit.
Actually, I fell down after being hit.

438
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,668
-My arm...
-Let me see.

439
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,217
That hurts.

440
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,513
-Bong-suk.
-Sorry?

441
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,307
I'm not Bong-suk. My name is--

442
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,018
Still, I was saved
because you called the police.

443
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,605
A scaredy-cat like you
still managed to do so

444
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,815
after being beaten up.

445
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,608
Come here.

446
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,445
Excuse me, but if you do this here--

447
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,322
Do you know how worried I was?

448
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,534
-You're a good boy.
-Wait...

449
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,619
-You cute little thing.
-Hold on.

450
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,288
I know I'm cute, but this is...

451
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,007
That's right.

452
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:33,052
Dad, you can't go to the police station
alone with Ms. Joo.

453
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,389
And our house isn't that safe either,
so...

454
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,100
Don't you know who I am?

455
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,518
Just one phone call,

456
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,438
truckloads of friends will come running.

457
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,441
Con artists, thugs, and thieves...

458
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,067
I have all types of friends.

459
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,820
I'll have protection
once I make that call...

460
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,573
Yeong-sin.

461
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,325
Aren't you done treating his hand?

462
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,538
Don't you think you're holding hands
for too long?

463
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,168
It's all done. Let's go eat.

464
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,461
What? Wait.

465
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,338
Me too?

466
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,256
Then what?

467
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,259
Are you going to sit there
and starve yourself while we eat?

468
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,136
Let's go.

469
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,180
Wait.

470
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,016
Hold on.

471
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,448
Ms. Chae made this potato dish.

472
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,491
Try it.

473
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,748
Here.

474
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:49,087
Yeong-sin can only make three dishes.

475
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,631
This potato dish is one of them.

476
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,466
Come on, it's not just three.

477
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:58,221
There's the potato dish,
kimchi fried rice, curry, and--

478
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,180
Let's eat.

479
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,183
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

480
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,186
Thank...

481
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,406
Why aren't you eating?

482
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,535
Do you prefer bread?

483
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,537
Then go downstairs.

484
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,164
Cheol-min is probably making some toast.

485
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,919
No, there are just so many dishes to eat.

486
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,278
Find every construction bid

487
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,655
Jeguk Construction submitted
over the past three to five years.

488
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,241
If Mr. Hwang offered up sexual bribes,

489
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,536
I'm sure some are related to Kim Ui-chan.

490
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,954
Yes, sir.

491
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,915
Go to Public Procurement Service.
I'll tell Mr. Oh that you'll be there.

492
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,833
Yes, sir.

493
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,837
How many are in Hwang Je-guk's
entertainment agency?

494
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,796
I know.

495
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,132
There are about 12.

496
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,593
This guy is so suspicious.

497
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:23,598
Why does a president of a construction
company have an entertainment agency?

498
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,224
No one's promising either.

499
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,269
They lured those women
with promises of stardom.

500
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,645
Stardom, my ass.

501
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,274
It's obvious they were used
for sexual bribes.

502
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,192
Is it obvious?

503
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,904
-Well, so...
-Is it?

504
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,616
-Are you a reporter or a psychic?
-I'm sorry.

505
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,285
Contact all the actresses in that agency.

506
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,078
See if anyone went through the same thing

507
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,997
or if anyone knows
about Joo Yeon-hui's case.

508
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,790
Yes, leave it to me.

509
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,168
Interviewing women is my specialty.

510
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,589
We also need to look into Kim Ui-chan.
Who are his advisers?

511
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,632
Mun-ho.

512
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:58,925
Do you know one of them?

513
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,343
Behind you.

514
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,395
Another team is taking on the story
about Kim Ui-chan and Hwang Je-guk.

515
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,190
You need to work on something else.

516
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,236
Go to the Philippines.

517
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,531
The daughter of the president
of a Korean company

518
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,991
was kidnapped there.

519
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,038
-I heard about it.
-You cover that story.

520
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,583
Wasn't she kidnapped a year ago?

521
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,461
"As more Korean companies
expand their business overseas,

522
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,880
more crimes against them are occurring."

523
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,425
-We'll focus on that aspect--
-Is this your idea or the higher-ups'?

524
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,094
Or external forces?

525
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:44,971
This special?

526
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,766
No, the idea to dig up a year-old case

527
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,312
to force me out of the country
for a while.

528
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,690
Mun-ho.

529
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:03,572
Whenever my sister-in-law serves food,
she always decorates the plate.

530
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,826
For example, she decorates it
with herbs or flowers.

531
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,706
So, can't you just regard my stories

532
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,917
as one of those herbs or flowers?

533
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,880
All the other news stations
cover the same things.

534
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,466
My story can help us stand out
from the rest.

535
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,761
Is that utterly impossible?

536
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,391
Our team
handles the special feature section,

537
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,227
and I'm the chief.

538
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:38,482
I'm ordering my subordinate
to investigate a story.

539
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,568
What should I do?

540
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,071
Should I put my hands together and beg?

541
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,756
I wasn't done talking.

542
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,928
What are you doing?

543
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,564
Do you realize that you're being
childish and immature?

544
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,691
You're acting like a 20-year-old.

545
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,694
Min-jae.

546
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,155
Smile once in a while.

547
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,157
It's such a shame

548
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,118
since you have such a pretty smile.

549
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,465
I, Kim Mun-ho,
editor of the news department,

550
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,635
resign due to a conflict of interest
with the station.

551
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,740
Should we just switch places?

552
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,992
My chair looks more comfortable,
doesn't it?

553
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,537
What? No, it's all right.

554
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,580
-I'm satisfied as is.
-Why not?

555
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,542
I get better sunlight here.

556
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,796
UV rays are bad for the skin.
It causes sunspots.

557
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,923
Chae Yeong-sin, you idiot!

558
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,926
-I'll never do it again.
-Do what?

559
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,761
What won't you do again?

560
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:36,016
A lowly reporter posted a story
without her chief's approval.

561
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,187
Even if it was an exclusive
no one else dared to cover,

562
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,690
and even if we recorded
the most views in our history,

563
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,233
and even though it had a great impact,

564
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,528
-a lowly reporter--
-How dare you!

565
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,117
-Reporter Yeo.
-Yes, sir.

566
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,494
How is Yeong-sin's article doing today?

567
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,538
Is it still a top searched item?

568
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,623
No, it disappeared a while ago.

569
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,502
An exclusive is an exclusive

570
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,464
only if someone else follows up on it.

571
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,092
It doesn't matter
how interesting the story is.

572
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,928
If no one cares about it,
then it's nothing but garbage.

573
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,098
It's even useless than toilet paper!

574
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,434
You're right.

575
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,271
-Reporter Yeo.
-Yes, sir.

576
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:26,108
Did anyone else publish an article about
the Kim Ui-chan, Hwang Je-guk story?

577
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,735
A few.

578
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,197
-Onara News, Incidents and Truth, and--
-You fool!

579
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,116
Not those small and insignificant ones!

580
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,620
Are any of them
mainstream newspapers or TV stations?

581
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,121
No, sir.

582
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,876
There's more.

583
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,588
This came to our office.

584
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,718
Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan
is suing us for defamation.

585
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,428
That's absurd.

586
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,222
I never disclosed his name.

587
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,389
-When did I--
-Is that so?

588
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,851
Really? Okay, let's take a look.

589
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,436
Here.

590
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,730
"An assemblyman in his third term.

591
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,067
Lead mayoral candidate for Seoul,
Assemblyman K."

592
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,276
Goodness.

593
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,446
It can't get more specific than this.

594
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:16,450
-Everything is pointing at him. Here...
-I made a huge mistake.

595
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,496
Chief, would the trial cost a lot?

596
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,748
-I'm--
-Are you serious?

597
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,129
You have two options.

598
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,798
Option A--

599
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,299
I can't resign.

600
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,884
This is so unfair.

601
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,594
If I've done anything wrong,

602
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,055
it would be drinking too much that night

603
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,349
and being out of my mind
from not sleeping for days.

604
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,600
That is all.

605
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,768
Then, option B.

606
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,936
I'll do anything.

607
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,729
-Do it right.
-But that's...

608
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,483
Sorry?

609
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,444
Whether it be for an article
or evidence in a trial,

610
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,947
dig up something we can use.

611
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,742
That's the only way we can survive.

612
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,705
Remember what I just said.

613
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,165
It's a pretty cool line

614
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,169
which rarely comes from my mouth.

615
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,130
Damn, my stomach hurts.

616
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,768
Ms. Jo.

617
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,645
Are you still upset?

618
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:32,860
Ms. Jo!

619
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,820
Hey.

620
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,323
Min-ja?

621
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,991
Honey.

622
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,492
You crazy jerk.

623
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,747
You know you can't stay mad at me

624
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,624
for more than a day.

625
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,668
Just know this.

626
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,255
If you're arrested
or if your identity is compromised,

627
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,507
I will cut ties with you in a heartbeat.

628
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:56,759
I know.

629
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,386
If you want to stay alive in prison,

630
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,765
you must forget
whatever you know about me.

631
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,978
I know nothing about you anyway.

632
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,898
I don't know what you look like
or your address.

633
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,317
Wait. Hold on.

634
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,653
Min-ja isn't even your real name, right?

635
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,488
So what?

636
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,824
Will you continue playing Superman there?

637
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,117
Superman?

638
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,370
-What did he do?
-You don't know Superman?

639
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,998
-Even if you don't watch movies--
-There are so many superheroes.

640
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,416
Which one is he?

641
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,754
Someone who went undercover
in a newspaper company for a girl.

642
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,340
So what? What now?

643
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,842
I sent you a picture.

644
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,680
My dad, my master, and three others
are in the picture.

645
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,932
Find out who they are.

646
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,559
The best way is to ask Master directly.

647
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,063
But you still can't reach him, right?

648
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,777
It's too sweet.

649
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:01,490
Anyway, Dae-yong is tailing Bae Sang-su.

650
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,159
She will call you
when the right time comes.

651
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,912
Help her out when she does.

652
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,039
What do you mean?

653
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,416
Help her out with what?

654
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,084
-Bae Sang-su is trying to--
-Bong-suk!

655
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,589
-Can you drive?
-Yes.

656
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:21,176
-I have a class one driver's license--
-Good.

657
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,971
-Where are we going?
-Come. It's important.

658
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,665
I have a superhot angel in front of me,

659
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,751
so record your message quickly
and hang up.

660
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,421
And stop calling!

661
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,757
Hey, Traitor.

662
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:06,388
Your apprentice has been
inquiring about your friends.

663
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,682
Should I just leave him be or what?

664
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,143
As for said apprentice,

665
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,604
I don't think he realizes yet,

666
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,858
but I think a girl
is complicating his job and life.

667
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,319
If this keeps up, it won't work for me.

668
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,572
I'll just watch for now,
but if he doesn't snap out of it,

669
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,574
we may need to replace him.

670
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,702
Do you have any other successors?

671
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,830
Someone who can take over as the Healer.

672
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,127
Since you left me

673
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,254
-Pardon?
-I just can't

674
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,256
-Pardon?
-Live without you

675
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,843
I miss you, my love

676
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,972
Even if I am alone

677
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,518
I am not sad

678
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:58,899
Because I have memories with you

679
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,568
But

680
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:07,741
-This deep sense of emptiness
-Do you always

681
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:13,580
just sing random songs at random places?

682
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,582
They are not random songs.

683
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,628
I don't like current songs
which is why I sing classics.

684
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,590
And I sing only at certain times.

685
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,969
It's when I'm super happy
or super annoyed.

686
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,262
And like now,

687
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,224
when I'm nervous, scared, and worried.

688
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,396
As days go by

689
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,439
Will I get used to it?

690
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,193
Do you even have an appointment?

691
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,821
That Hwang Je-guk guy...

692
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,865
Will he even meet with us?

693
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,242
Of course not.

694
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,536
But who am I?

695
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,872
I've honed my skills
in tailing, staking out,

696
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,958
and barging into people's homes
in this industry,

697
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,334
so just leave it to me.

698
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,004
Wait, did you just talk down to me?

699
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,381
What? Of course not.

700
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,174
You must have heard it wrong.

701
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,343
No, I'm sure I heard you just now.

702
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,053
-You--
-I think we're here.

703
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:11,763
Is this it?

704
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,765
Are we here? Really?

705
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,663
-This is bad.
-What is? Why?

706
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,085
This looks bad.

707
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,503
Very bad.

708
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,177
We can either just drive past them,

709
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:54,514
or turn the car around here.

710
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,682
We can't do that.

711
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,892
Stop the car.

712
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,651
No, never mind. Pass.

713
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,319
Let's come up with a plan first.

714
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,528
Go.

715
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,446
Just leave!

716
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:10,822
No, stop.

717
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,784
We need to fight them head-on.

718
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,119
-That's right.
-Fight them head-on.

719
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,832
No, go.

720
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,750
Go.

721
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,752
No, stop!

722
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,755
Stop. This is a matter of my pride.

723
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,340
Yes, pride.

724
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,306
I'm scared. Let's just go.

725
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,350
Let's make an appointment first. Hurry.

726
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,643
Go.

727
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,695
Hello, Mr. Bae. What brings you here?

728
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,450
Are you here to make sure your boys
are doing a good job protecting me?

729
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,910
Your boys are great at their job.

730
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,496
Not a single reporter has even come close.

731
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,916
I've brought a reporter.

732
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,086
What?

733
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,133
She's the first to write
the story about you.

734
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:57,596
We think she may be hiding
Joo Yeon-hui as well.

735
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,599
I see.

736
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,227
Was it her?

737
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,271
My goodness.

738
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,607
She is quite brave for a girl.

739
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,873
Hello.

740
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,375
I'm Reporter Chae Yeong-sin
of Someday News.

741
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,919
If you don't mind,

742
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:33,089
I would like to ask you a few questions.

743
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,178
Rather than contacting me
via phone or e-mail,

744
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,347
you came to see me in person.

745
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,350
Wow, what a hard-working reporter.

746
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,187
And you've got guts.

747
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:54,945
I didn't think you would answer my call
or agree to meet me,

748
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,739
so we came to take a few pictures
from the outside.

749
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,701
Look at you.

750
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,578
Not bad.

751
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,666
Miss, why don't I offer you a job?

752
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,628
-I don't think I can--
-No.

753
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,505
Our entertainment agency is pretty big.

754
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,383
We give a fat signing bonus too.

755
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,480
You know Ms. Joo Yeon-hui, correct?

756
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,110
She was an actress
signed with your agency.

757
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,279
I like you more and more.

758
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:41,449
Do you know
that she reported you to the police?

759
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,578
You are accused of bribery,
sexual assault,

760
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,622
and she said she was assaulted too.

761
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:53,253
We have photographs
from the hospital she went to.

762
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,301
-I'd like you to comment on this matter.
-Here's the thing.

763
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,429
You have no manners whatsoever.

764
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,056
How old are you?

765
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,894
-I'm old enough.
-And yet, you don't get it.

766
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,730
Even if you write your stories,
no one will take them.

767
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,982
Someone will. We, at Someday News--

768
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,611
Should I tell the National Tax Service
to audit that newspaper company?

769
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:22,741
If the owner finds out,
he will rush over and get on his knees.

770
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,076
-But, sir--
-Yeon-hui.

771
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,787
Where is she?

772
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:33,835
-You're losing your manners too.
-What?

773
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,296
She was assaulted?

774
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,639
Like this?

775
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,274
Did she mean something like this?

776
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,451
-Come on. We should leave.
-Move.

777
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,996
I'm scared. I can't do this.

778
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,332
I don't want to do this.
Please, can we go?

779
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,416
Hey!

780
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,838
Hey! You can't leave just yet.

781
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,257
I have got a lot to teach you.

782
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:25,136
Mr. Bae, did you hear me?
I have a lot more to say!

783
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,109
An interview?

784
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,735
-Yeong-sin.
-Fine.

785
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,279
-I'll bring everyone in my agency,
-Hey.

786
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,280
so you can ask them!

787
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:49,953
Ask them how generous I am
to those useless pieces of trash.

788
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,873
My generosity knows no end. Just ask them!

789
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,329
Yeong-sin.

790
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,894
Mom.

791
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,272
Mom!

792
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,443
Mom...

793
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,793
Now is the time.

794
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,045
Now?

795
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,423
But there are so many of them.

796
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,643
Hey, miss. Come over here.

797
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,313
Let's begin the interview.
Let's get on with it.

798
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,357
I'll let you dig very deep.

799
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,936
Get them!

800
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,069
Hey! Damn it!

801
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,744
It's been connected.

802
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,153
That's it!

803
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,698
What the...

804
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,117
Did you press something?

805
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,619
No, I didn't.

806
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,336
Open the door.

807
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,172
What the hell?

808
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,757
Shit. What's going on?

809
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,677
-Hey! What's going on?
-Hey!

810
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,109
What is it?

811
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,778
What?

812
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,822
What do you mean my car is haunted?

813
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,407
Fine.

814
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,786
I need to step out for a minute.

815
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,666
You, come with me. You, stay here.

816
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,634
Yeong-sin!

817
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,570
Hey, miss.

818
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,488
Haven't you seen someone get hit before?

819
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:41,119
How can you write about something
that you've never seen with your eyes?

820
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,620
As a reporter,

821
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:47,792
you must only write about those
you see or hear in person.

822
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:11,107
Now that you've seen it,
you should start writing.

823
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,942
What will you write?

824
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,527
Why don't you tell me?

825
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,118
-Stop!
-Get it!

826
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:23,661
Get it!

827
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,755
Stop the car!

828
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,346
Hey, look up.

829
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,599
Are you that scared?

830
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:52,899
You...

831
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,027
What?

832
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,824
-You...
-I can't hear you! Speak louder!

833
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,330
You're a hopeless

834
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,667
piece of trash.

835
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,740
-Sir!
-Sir!

836
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,082
Bong-su!

837
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,709
Yeong-sin?

838
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,002
Are you okay?

839
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:56,879
Please help me.

840
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,631
Wait, come here.

841
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,175
Look at me.

842
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,178
Follow me. Can you do that?

843
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:07,932
This way.

844
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,431
The reason I show up near her

845
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:51,100
is because I've been using her as bait.

846
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,686
He pressed charges against her?

847
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,938
You're Healer, aren't you?

848
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,649
We have no video nor power.

849
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,193
We have no money to go to court.

850
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,486
The truth?

851
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,571
Who cares about that anymore?

852
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,657
It must be Kim Mun-sik,
the owner of Jeil News.

853
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,619
He killed Ko Seong-cheol
and framed me for the murder.

854
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:12,538
I have a crush on someone.

855
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,416
I think I've met him.
