00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,900
BLOCKED CALL

2
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,823
Hello?

3
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,327
Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

4
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,497
Who is this?

5
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,958
I'm sure you've heard of Healer.

6
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,466
I heard you don't speak
with clients directly.

7
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,884
I know.

8
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:38,348
I don't usually do this,
but this is so urgent

9
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,644
that I had to ask you in person.

10
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,574
I'll compensate you for your troubles.

11
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,538
I could give you a coupon
that allows you to hire

12
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,790
the best messenger free of charge.

13
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,917
Let's hear your question first.

14
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,710
We can negotiate afterward.

15
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,004
There is a picture in that box.

16
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,676
You know those five people, don't you?

17
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,386
I do.

18
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,640
Do you know what happened to those people

19
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,976
in February of 1992?

20
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,562
I know

21
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,522
as much as I saw.

22
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:31,067
What is your price
for telling me about them?

23
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,445
Will you show me your face?

24
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,907
I'm sorry, but that's...

25
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,495
Park Bong-su.

26
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,749
I found this phone
in that reporter's jacket.

27
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,630
This model is pretty rare
so I remember it well.

28
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,965
It's Chae Yeong-sin's, isn't it?

29
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,636
She lost it in the elevator incident

30
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,391
and the only people who were there
were the one who caused it

31
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,393
and Healer.

32
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,695
Park Bong-su.

33
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:21,409
I need to see that face of yours again.

34
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,953
Will you show me?

35
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,374
Those are my terms.

36
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,419
Show me your face,

37
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,674
and I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

38
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,467
I actually grew fond of Someday News.

39
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,928
It's a shame I'll have to leave.

40
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,560
Okay then, shall we begin?

41
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,537
Which of the five
do you want to know about?

42
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,873
The man on the far left.

43
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,710
The one wearing red.

44
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,005
Seo Jun-seok?

45
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,757
Do you know

46
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,468
what he did

47
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,053
in 1992?

48
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,100
Do you know

49
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,062
about Unknown Island?

50
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,107
-What?
-No one knows its real name

51
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,776
or where it is,

52
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,070
hence the name.

53
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,205
Look.

54
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,085
I'm showing you my face
which means I'm very serious.

55
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,086
So...

56
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:43,760
It's Unknown Island!

57
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,182
Please

58
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,976
continue.

59
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,190
Not long ago,

60
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,609
my sister-in-law called me.

61
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,861
Someone broke into her house.

62
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,157
She was shocked because
he looked so much like her old friend.

63
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:13,581
I'm sure she remembers
much better than I do

64
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,584
for time has stopped for her

65
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,878
since 1992.

66
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,673
I get it now.

67
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,802
You look so alike.

68
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,224
You're a night messenger
whose anonymity is your life.

69
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,019
But you want to know so much
about this man, Seo Jun-seok,

70
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:41,776
that you were willing to expose your face.

71
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,238
You have his eyes.

72
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,573
Seo Jeong-hu.

73
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,828
Are you Jeong-hu?

74
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:00,670
Jeong-hu! Jeong-hu, play with me.

75
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,090
Jeong-hu.

76
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,759
Jeong-hu, let's play.

77
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,053
Stop running around.

78
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,889
If you keep running,
I won't let you into this island.

79
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,808
It's Unknown Island!

80
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,853
That's what it's called
because no one knows

81
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,688
its real name or where it is.

82
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,649
-Can we go in?
-Not yet.

83
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,615
What is this place?

84
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,992
-Unknown Island!
-Unknown Island!

85
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,160
Where is this island?

86
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,786
-No one knows!
-No one knows!

87
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,829
What is its name?

88
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,080
-Unknown Island!
-Unknown Island!

89
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,000
What? I said no one knows its name.

90
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,296
So, who wants to go into this island?

91
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,757
-Me!
-Me too!

92
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,474
You have to play quietly in there, okay?

93
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,018
If you're loud, pirates will come for you.

94
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,102
-Okay.
-All right.

95
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,082
Whenever the gang got together,

96
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,044
they drank or talked all night long.

97
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:27,757
So it was always my job
to babysit you guys.

98
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,387
-Do you want a drink?
-I don't drink with anyone.

99
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,101
We were actually quite close.

100
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,148
You keep saying "you guys."

101
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,067
Was that me

102
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,820
and some girl? She was

103
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,906
about my age and...

104
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,661
Yes, Gil-han had a daughter.

105
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,372
-What happened to her?
-She died.

106
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,876
She died in 1992.

107
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,341
So many people died that year.

108
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,096
Where do you want to start?

109
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,431
Who was the person my dad killed?

110
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,895
-No one told you?
-No.

111
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,108
I don't know many people. So, who was it?

112
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,277
Who is the man

113
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,323
people say my dad killed?

114
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,328
It was Oh Gil-han.

115
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,964
Yes, he was one of the five friends.

116
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,221
He killed...

117
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,059
a friend?

118
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,312
But you're asking the wrong questions.

119
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,315
Your dad was only

120
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,276
a murder suspect, not a murderer.

121
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,820
Do you know the difference?

122
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,990
I do. I went through it myself.

123
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,075
But he died before he could

124
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,328
clear his name.

125
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,331
So from since then,

126
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,083
your dad has been only

127
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,960
a murder suspect.

128
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,841
Do you want to clear his name?

129
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,595
Is that why you came to me?

130
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,059
He said he'll work with me
to clear my dad's name.

131
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,352
He said he'll help.

132
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,103
So?

133
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,192
I plan to continue working at Someday News
as Park Bong-su.

134
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,485
That's what he suggested.

135
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,071
I don't like the idea.

136
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,990
I've never liked Kim Mun-ho.

137
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,575
You know how he is.

138
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:05,289
He can make up believable lies
at the drop of a hat.

139
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,336
I don't like that you showed your face
to someone like that.

140
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,507
He said he played with me
when I was little.

141
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,218
I think I remember it too.

142
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,928
Let me ask this.

143
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,847
Why the sudden interest

144
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,433
in clearing your dad's name?

145
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,978
Will your dad send you
a thank you card from heaven?

146
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,939
Will it come in the mail?

147
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,566
-Well...
-Well, what?

148
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,406
I want to tell her.

149
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,578
I want to tell Chae Yeong-sin

150
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,832
that I'm actually a thief.

151
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,086
But I can't say my dad was a murderer.

152
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,587
That's completely different.

153
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,882
You want to tell whom, what?

154
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,468
You said so yourself that

155
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,346
if a girl would go
to a deserted island with me,

156
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,931
then I can date her.

157
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,478
I think I can tell Yeong-sin about

158
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,191
who I am, and ask if she'd go with me.

159
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,656
She'll initially beat me up
for lying to her.

160
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,658
She'll probably kick and punch me.

161
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,661
That I can take.

162
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,455
I'm sure

163
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,542
she'll get over it though.

164
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,670
That's how she is.

165
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,341
She'll sing some strange song
and do some weird dance,

166
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,594
and then she'll be fine.

167
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,057
Ms. Jo, are you still there?

168
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,356
I know what you're thinking.

169
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,903
"Healer is done for.

170
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,364
I'd better find a replacement.
How annoying."

171
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,991
I get it,

172
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,579
but it's just until I clear my dad's name.

173
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,415
I just have a bad feeling about this.

174
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,293
Something keeps nagging at me.

175
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,548
So please watch my back
for a little bit more.

176
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,719
I'll be more careful, okay?

177
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,013
Ms. Jo?

178
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,274
THIS IS CHAE YEONG-SIN

179
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,576
-Yeong-sin!
-Oh my gosh.

180
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,578
Something big happened!

181
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,579
What is it?

182
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,082
-Didn't you get the call?
-What call?

183
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,378
Hwang Je-guk killed himself.

184
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,383
-The Hwang Je-guk?
-Yes, him.

185
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,343
He'd never do that.

186
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,555
You're kidding, right? Come on. Really?

187
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,014
Wait for me!

188
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,520
Our Someday News website
has been down since 11 p.m.

189
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,313
How is it still not fixed?

190
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,941
Bullshit! Who investigates like that?

191
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,235
Since when were they so diligent?

192
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,655
There will be a photo-line.
Get as close as possible.

193
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,991
Ask questions when you see an opening.

194
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:31,662
But I don't know what to ask.

195
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,664
-Write this down.
-Sure.

196
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,172
Bong-su, what's going on?

197
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,341
Apparently, Hwang Je-guk killed himself.

198
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,136
Could it because of me?

199
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,055
It couldn't be, right? Hey.

200
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,849
What's up with him?

201
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:58,772
-We're heading out.
-We're heading out.

202
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,944
The server hosting company
keeps making excuses

203
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,112
and pushing it off.

204
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,740
It's absurd that
they still can't handle the traffic.

205
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,492
What if we get our own server?

206
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,246
There's no point.
Outsiders could still get to it.

207
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,581
What are our options?

208
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,208
We can find a server outside the country.

209
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,210
Let's do that. We'll move our server.

210
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,837
Now?

211
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,464
-Chae Yeong-sin.
-Yes?

212
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,174
Is Joo Yeon-hui still staying with you?

213
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,550
Yes, she's at my house.

214
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,053
Hwang Je-guk's suicide note mentioned her.

215
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,221
Reporters must be looking for her.

216
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,598
Get an exclusive interview first,

217
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,058
and then get her out of there.

218
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,393
Interview her and then get her out. Roger.

219
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,020
Bong-su.

220
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,438
-Jong-su.
-Yes?

221
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,523
Go with Yeong-sin. Take your camera.

222
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,775
Yes.

223
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,526
But...

224
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,529
-Park Bong-su.
-Yes?

225
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,407
Get ready. You're coming with me.

226
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,327
Yes, sir. I'll get ready right away.

227
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,745
What the...

228
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,207
Hey, Bong-su.

229
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,125
Are you avoiding me?

230
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,090
Don't tell me it's because of

231
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,759
what we talked about at your secret spot.

232
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,807
-Yeong-sin.
-Yes, let's talk it out.

233
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,102
I don't like it being awkward between us.

234
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,109
Would you please move out of my way?

235
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,361
-What?
-You see, I need to go,

236
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,238
but you're leaning on my bag.

237
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,364
Right.

238
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,700
Thanks.

239
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,410
Hey.

240
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,495
Don't you want to talk to me?

241
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,289
I don't.

242
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,545
Let's go.

243
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,505
Aren't you coming?

244
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,768
I should have noticed it sooner.

245
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,312
There is no way that would have happened.

246
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,774
I should have suspected it
when I heard the name "Healer."

247
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,862
Well, it's a common username
on online gaming sites.

248
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,616
I met your mother once.

249
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,536
It was very difficult to find her.

250
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,832
She told me you were studying abroad.

251
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,461
Are you going to keep doing this?

252
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,796
You know, acting close.

253
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,761
If I ask how you became
a night messenger--

254
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,139
I wouldn't answer, Mr. Kim.

255
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,268
You used to call me "Uncle."

256
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,896
Don't you remember?

257
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,607
I hate people talking to me

258
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,486
when I'm eating, sleeping or driving.

259
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,613
Well,

260
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,157
it's infuriating.

261
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,356
This is the junkyard our family ran.

262
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,859
It was like the hangout
for the five friends.

263
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,448
They ran a pirate radio broadcast.

264
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,119
It was brave of them because it was a time

265
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,913
when you could get arrested
for saying the wrong things.

266
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,126
Do you know much about those times?

267
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,211
I don't, and

268
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,296
I don't care.

269
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,007
So let's cut to the chase.

270
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,513
Over there.

271
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,765
That's where they'd gather.

272
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,899
Your dad was always fixing something.

273
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,908
Gil-han and Myeong-hui were always

274
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,328
writing the script for the next broadcast
or laughing.

275
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,707
That's what I remember.

276
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,753
They were laughing, affectionate and warm.

277
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,677
So just when

278
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:40,971
was that?

279
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,933
-It was in 1981.
-In 1981?

280
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,855
Do you plan on telling me everything

281
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,692
from 1981 to when my dad died in 1992?

282
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,613
Let's not do that.

283
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,949
Don't you know how it feels

284
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,827
to be glad to see an old friend or

285
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,787
want to know how they've been doing?

286
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,041
Should I?

287
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,007
Do you have any friends?

288
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,929
Do you have anyone to ask
if you have friends?

289
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,892
I still

290
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,895
don't trust you, boss.

291
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,107
You paid a night messenger like me
to get information on someone,

292
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,944
and then buy the company she works at.

293
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,364
You stay by her side
and are friendly with her,

294
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,700
but you won't tell her anything.

295
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,372
What game were you playing
when you searched for her?

296
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,832
That's what I'd like to ask.

297
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,335
But it's my policy not to pry,

298
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,712
so I'll just leave it.

299
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,090
You should stop too.

300
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,968
Why do you care about my friends?

301
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,730
It's gone now,

302
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,526
but there was an office over there.

303
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,030
My brother ran the place
after inheriting it.

304
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,492
And that day in 1992,

305
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,745
Gil-han and Jun-seok came to see him.

306
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:33,458
-Hi, guys.
-They were well-known reporters by then.

307
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,961
Gil-han wrote the articles,

308
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,755
and your dad Jun-seok took the photos.

309
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,508
They published many exclusives.

310
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,510
This intel is foolproof.

311
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,597
The slush fund will be moved
via car tomorrow.

312
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,975
We're going to see who it is delivered to.

313
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,977
Seeing it isn't enough.

314
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,939
I will take photos of the transaction
and win an award for them.

315
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,610
So we came to borrow a car.
We'll need a decent one.

316
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,696
There will be a car chase.

317
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,240
You've seen it in the movies, right?

318
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,075
Seriously,

319
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,703
how is everything fun for you?

320
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,830
Isn't it fun? It is for me.

321
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,874
Is a car all you need?

322
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,542
Of course not.

323
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,879
It'll be a sappy melodrama

324
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,924
-if you're not behind the wheel.
-Stop that. It isn't funny.

325
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,761
Isn't it? A sappy car chase...

326
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,597
A car chase. C as in camera?

327
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,101
The next morning,

328
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,854
the three of them took off in a car

329
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,939
with my brother behind the wheel.

330
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,691
And that day,

331
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,654
Gil-han died and your dad was arrested

332
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,700
for supposedly killing him.

333
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,870
What about the third person?

334
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,790
Your brother.

335
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,918
He was the witness to that murder.

336
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,672
What we need to find is

337
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,258
Jun-seok's testimony from that day.

338
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,553
I'm sure he told the police what happened

339
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,098
over and over during the investigation.

340
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,265
But?

341
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,771
I tried various routes,
but I kept hitting a dead end.

342
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,901
The police wouldn't show me his testimony

343
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,903
and the autopsy report disappeared.

344
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,324
This is everything I have gathered.
Take it.

345
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,162
-Be careful.
-Sure.

346
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,164
I couldn't trust you either.

347
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,209
I've been betrayed many times before.

348
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,089
People I hired would
switch sides on me the next day.

349
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,299
So,

350
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,219
I told the police

351
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,433
that Healer would be near Chae Yeong-sin.

352
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,062
-So I'm sure--
-Yes, I saw.

353
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,649
They've been following Yeong-sin around.

354
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:08,989
Anyway, may I go home early today, boss?

355
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,241
I have a lot to investigate.

356
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,077
Sure.

357
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,642
What? Are you done already?

358
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,314
That was quick.

359
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,818
It was ridiculously quick.

360
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,030
Hwang Je-guk's autopsy report
is already out.

361
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,117
The analysis of the drug they think
he used is out too.

362
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,663
"It's the same as the one
that killed Ko Seong-cheol.

363
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,873
See? The train ticket is here too.

364
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,794
So Hwang Je-guk killed Ko Seong-cheol."

365
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,962
The end.

366
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,923
Are you telling me
that the case is closed?

367
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,259
Yes, it's closed and sealed.

368
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,344
What a load of crap.

369
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,974
Should I congratulate you
for closing the case

370
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,642
so quickly?

371
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,270
Please don't. Anyway, that's not all.

372
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,855
Hwang Je-guk's suicide note
is like the Giving Tree.

373
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,274
The suicide note...

374
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,033
The suicide note named several people.

375
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,911
Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan was one of them.

376
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,248
It said how they received
sexual bribes and what-not.

377
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,875
Healer must have

378
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,837
joined forces with people very high up.

379
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,717
People who can easily clear him of murder.

380
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,344
Wait, are you saying that Healer did this?

381
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,305
It's been five years.

382
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,099
That's how long that scoundrel

383
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,185
has been making a fool of me like this.

384
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,946
IDENTIFICATION CARD, PARK BONG-SU

385
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,706
Jeguk Construction's President Hwang was

386
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,750
found dead in his house in Gangnam-gu

387
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,002
by one of his guards.

388
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:13,089
A drug and suicide note
were found with the body.

389
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,885
The note describes
how he provided sexual bribes to

390
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,430
high officials and obtained
special treatment.

391
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:25,810
The police is forming
a special task force to investigate...

392
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,062
Yes, thank you.

393
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,401
Dad, Yeon-hui is ready.

394
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,114
It looks like the case between

395
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,159
you and Hwang Je-guk will be dropped.

396
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,412
The issue now is Kim Ui-chan's response.

397
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,415
Yeon-hui, don't worry
and go stay in Sokcho.

398
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,460
The owner's son almost went to prison,

399
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,421
but Chi-su took care of it
pretty much for free.

400
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,050
They will take very good care of you.

401
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,846
If by any chance they don't,
call right away.

402
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,098
Call me.

403
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:08,478
I'll run right over and
teach them some manners...

404
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,272
Why don't you know when to stop?

405
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,149
I stopped.

406
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,985
Let's go.
I'll take you to the bus terminal.

407
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,196
-Mr. Chae.
-Please,

408
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,909
let's not do goodbyes.

409
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,203
I'm not good at them.

410
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,457
Thank you.

411
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,376
Sure.

412
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,088
I don't like goodbyes either.

413
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,006
So, let's just say we did it and...

414
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,508
Gosh.

415
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,011
I'll never forget you.

416
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,346
You better not.

417
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,891
You never know when I'll show up
to collect your debt.

418
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,523
Welcome.

419
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,362
What would you like?

420
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,240
I can make you regular coffee but

421
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,825
if you want something else...

422
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,452
Chae Yeong-sin is here, right?

423
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,619
Pardon?

424
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,039
I heard she came this way.

425
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,043
-Come in.
-Thank you.

426
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,048
-Please, have a seat.
-Thank you.

427
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,551
This is new.

428
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,138
A cafe and lawyer's office in one.

429
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:29,350
One is my dad's job,
and the other is his hobby.

430
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,147
So, Hwang Je-guk is dead.

431
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,441
I know. I was shocked too.

432
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,778
While your father works his day job,

433
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:44,324
does he secretly record
consultations with his clients?

434
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,534
Of course not. No.

435
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,039
Here's a camera.

436
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:58,546
And if you don't want a blind spot,

437
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,967
somewhere here would be good.
Right, here's one.

438
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,262
That's two.

439
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:10,225
Who the hell
put something like this in our...

440
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,560
Have you never seen these before?

441
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,066
Why are you here?

442
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,109
How did you know about these?

443
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,529
You know Healer, don't you?

444
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,406
Someone informed me that

445
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,409
Healer would be in your vicinity.

446
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,329
Don't you know him?

447
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,041
I know Healer. He's the night messenger.

448
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,961
I heard he's very expensive
and that no one has

449
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,003
ever seen him.

450
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,173
Important videos disappeared
from Hwang Je-guk's house.

451
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,176
Then Someday News aired those very videos.

452
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,178
And then Hwang Je-guk died.

453
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,596
Amazing, no?

454
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,598
Which part?

455
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,395
I know it was Healer who got the videos

456
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,480
from Hwang Je-guk's house.

457
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,111
So I think perhaps he's the one

458
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,071
who killed Hwang Je-guk too.

459
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:09,242
I heard Healer doesn't hurt people.

460
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,580
I think your information is outdated.

461
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:19,669
We think he's the suspect in two murders.

462
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,255
But what is more amazing is that

463
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,048
Hwang Je-guk confessed to

464
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,594
the murder that we suspect Healer of.

465
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,263
He said so in his suicide note
when no one asked.

466
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,808
-So?
-Excuse me?

467
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:39,355
You're a reporter, so think about it.

468
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,276
Perhaps someone forced him

469
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,487
to write that suicide note
and fed him the words.

470
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,656
Or maybe someone else wrote it for him.

471
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,492
Those are my theories.

472
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,140
Let's take a look.

473
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,267
What's this?

474
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,439
This looks like Kim Mun-ho's notes.

475
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,485
Here are newspaper articles.

476
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,446
SUSPECT HAS COMMITTED SUICIDE

477
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,491
And what's this?

478
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,618
Healer.

479
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,581
These are names of policemen,
prosecutors, detectives,

480
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,541
and other people who worked on the case.

481
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,251
You got an email.

482
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,254
Actually, it arrived quite some time ago,

483
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,173
but I was contemplating something.

484
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:51,302
Look, I can't take on anything
until I finish this.

485
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,221
So please be a little understanding.

486
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:59,852
The sender is cys at someday.

487
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,773
-Read it to me.
-You want me to read it?

488
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,275
Since when did I ever read the emails?
What is it?

489
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,195
Subject. "I am Chae Yeong-sin."

490
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,574
"I don't know what I need to do"

491
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,827
or how much it costs to hire Healer."

492
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,578
Wait, stop. Stop.

493
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:22,291
I'll read it. I'll read it,
so forward it to me.

494
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:37,724
You, who seem like you're mine,
when you aren't

495
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:44,355
Me, who seems like I'm yours, when I'm not

496
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,649
Shoot.

497
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,985
I AM CHAE YEONG-SIN

498
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,446
I don't even know

499
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,241
whether this email will reach Healer,

500
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,243
but I am writing anyway.

501
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,546
I am Chae Yeong-sin.

502
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,843
I need to meet you.

503
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,436
If you tell me not to look at you,
I'll cover my eyes.

504
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,159
If you tell me not to speak,

505
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,578
I won't make a sound.

506
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,291
All I want is to know that

507
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,920
if I want it this badly,
you'll do as I ask

508
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,423
and come to me, and watch me

509
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,926
from behind somewhere.

510
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,930
That is all I want. So...

511
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,891
I'm sort of asking you out on a date.

512
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,977
Will you accept my offer?

513
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,359
So, what will you do?

514
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,279
Will you go on that date?

515
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,448
Please don't.

516
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,912
You said so yourself
that you won't get involved with her

517
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,540
until you clear your dad's name.

518
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,875
She says she'll cover her eyes.

519
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,796
She says I don't have to say a word.

520
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,342
What kind of an idiotic date is that?

521
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,304
What? What's wrong with it?

522
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,558
Let me be blunt.

523
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,645
Chae Yeong-sin is a good catch
objectively speaking.

524
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:52,525
Her father has a good job
and she has a solid one too.

525
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,778
Her personality is fine,
even though she gets crazy at times.

526
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,406
Looks? She's attractive.

527
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,659
What are you babbling about? I'm--

528
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,578
Shut it and let me finish.

529
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,665
Someone like her can easily find a nice,
handsome guy

530
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,584
with a good, secure job.

531
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,920
Someone who'd adore her
and care for her all her life

532
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,922
while moving to bigger homes

533
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,425
and establishing good retirement plans.

534
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:21,387
There are plenty of guys
who can do that for her.

535
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,639
But you've never shown her your face

536
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,892
and can't tell her your name.

537
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,895
All you can do is ask her
to go to a deserted island.

538
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,355
So why are you doing this to her?

539
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,610
Fine then, I'll show her.

540
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,737
I can show her my face.

541
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,031
You little mutt.

542
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,409
If she sees Healer's face

543
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,077
but doesn't tell the police,

544
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,289
she becomes an accessory.

545
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,042
Want me to recite the Penal Code for you?

546
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,631
So, Healer...

547
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,675
Don't do it.

548
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,803
Leave her alone.

549
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,683
But she asked.

550
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,020
I should at least respond...

551
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,732
at the very least.

552
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,762
The informant
is very worried for your safety.

553
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,597
It would be easier for me

554
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,599
to just tail you and watch quietly

555
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,644
in order to catch Healer.

556
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,479
But I'm worried.

557
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,773
I'm the expert on Healer.

558
00:37:56,148 --> 00:38:00,736
He has no morals,
or a sense of justice or loyalty.

559
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,614
He just works with whoever pays him more.

560
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,410
And now, he has begun to kill people.

561
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,745
He's scary.

562
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,877
It's so cold.

563
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,212
This is what you do on a date.

564
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,885
First, you need to walk together.

565
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,057
Walk side by side and laugh and talk.

566
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,978
While you walk,
you should argue once in a while too.

567
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,860
After the walk, you'll get hungry.

568
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,988
So you eat.

569
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,741
"What should we get?" "I want this."

570
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,868
"No, I want that."

571
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,996
"Hey, why do you always
insist on what you want?"

572
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,623
"I do not."

573
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,090
It wouldn't be a date without a movie.

574
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,467
I bet you don't like crowded places.

575
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,011
So what about a late-night movie?

576
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,889
The theater will be empty and dark.

577
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,601
What kind of movies do you like?

578
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,396
We don't even have to sit together

579
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,733
as long as we watch a same movie.

580
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,779
This Friday night,

581
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,782
I'll wait for you at the cinema.

582
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,494
How long should I wait?

583
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,740
Welcome, Chae Yeong-sin.

584
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,959
What kind of movies do you like?

585
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,711
Classics to new releases.

586
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,713
Comedy, romance, action.

587
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,800
Just say the word.

588
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,012
Let's see.

589
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,391
What about the longest movie?

590
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,225
I have a car waiting
in front of the cinema.

591
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,185
He'll take her home safely.

592
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,520
So

593
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,649
now that you responded
to her request, what...

594
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,042
Mr. Kim Mun-sik.

595
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,128
Assemblyman Kim.

596
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,630
What brings you here unannounced?

597
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,883
You think I don't know what's going on?

598
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,304
You're throwing me under the bus
to take my spot.

599
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,974
How long have you been planning this?

600
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,101
Kim Mun-ho, your brother,

601
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:20,147
talks like a communist on the outside,

602
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:24,192
but I see he actually
does your dirty work.

603
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,029
You used your brother to trip me up

604
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:30,115
while you sweet-talked Boss
behind my back.

605
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,286
You vicious piece of trash!

606
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,288
Let go!

607
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,541
Where do you think you're going?

608
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,298
The assemblyman is upset.
Let him rest somewhere.

609
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,091
Make sure to show him out.

610
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,385
I am Kim Ui-chan!

611
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,513
You think I'll go down this easily?
Not a chance!

612
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,059
Boss isn't the type
to fall for your antics!

613
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,478
You can't even imagine the loyalty

614
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,105
I've shown him over the years!

615
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,817
Let go of me, you idiots! Let go!

616
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,787
There is a message from Healer.

617
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,456
He says he heard the news,

618
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,459
and will destroy the video as promised.

619
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,796
Destroy it? Shouldn't we receive it?

620
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,548
According to him,

621
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:33,470
the sample that he showed you
was all he had.

622
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,722
He apologized for conning you.

623
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:43,313
We won't know if that's true
until we check.

624
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,568
I must have Healer.

625
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,195
It won't be easy.

626
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,322
Since we framed him for murder--

627
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,573
Find a way.

628
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,992
He's under contract with Mun-ho, correct?

629
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,327
That's what we deduced.

630
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,287
As we've always done in the past,

631
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,873
we'll do whatever we can
to bring him to my side.

632
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,585
If he rejects, you get rid of him.

633
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,838
Yes, sir.

634
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,757
So your wife...

635
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,468
She went to meet Jun-seok's wife.

636
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,637
So you told her?

637
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,557
We don't know what the wife will tell her.

638
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,517
My wife wanted to see her.

639
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,853
She rarely asks me for anything,

640
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,479
so I had to let her go.

641
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,914
Have some tea.

642
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,417
Thank you.

643
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,337
Please, look at me.

644
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,884
I can't. How could I?

645
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,388
Maybe I shouldn't have
asked you to see me.

646
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,391
How did you find me?

647
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,145
I was trying so hard to hide.

648
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:09,691
I still keep the photo of the five of us
by my bed.

649
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,568
I couldn't do that

650
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,697
if I suspected Jun-seok even for a moment.

651
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,492
I know that's what you believe,

652
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,578
and I appreciate you saying that.

653
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,456
But others aren't like you.

654
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,710
They say he killed his friend
and committed suicide.

655
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,922
Who am I to fight against that?

656
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:37,010
-Please...
-They say my husband killed yours.

657
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,264
So you shouldn't come here,
saying you missed me.

658
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,643
What do you want me to do?

659
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:01,660
I saw a young man
who looked a lot like Jun-seok,

660
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,371
so it made me think of you.

661
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:09,793
I know you left for Jeong-hu's sake.

662
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,421
You didn't want people
pointing fingers at him,

663
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,382
so you left your young son.

664
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,844
I lost a child too.

665
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,056
I wanted to hold your hand
and talk to you.

666
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,727
We used to be close.

667
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,731
-Myeong-hui.
-Yes?

668
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,441
I didn't want

669
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:38,738
Jeong-hu being called a murderer's son.

670
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,991
But no,

671
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,827
that wasn't all there was to it.

672
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,665
Back then,
I did everything I possibly could

673
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:52,043
to clear Jun-seok's name.

674
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,631
But he came and told me

675
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,092
not to do anything

676
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,638
unless I wanted Jeong-hu to get hurt.

677
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,682
Who did?

678
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,643
Who said such a thing?

679
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,354
The man you live with.

680
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:16,526
I assumed you knew about it.

681
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,074
Good morning!

682
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,498
Where is everyone?

683
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,542
I don't know. I'm too busy.

684
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,044
I think I work way too much

685
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,379
for what little I get paid for.

686
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:39,716
People take it for granted
because I don't complain.

687
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,844
I guess you really need to complain
every so often.

688
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,763
-Chief.
-The chief is busy.

689
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:45,931
Where is everyone?

690
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,433
They received assignments and ran out.

691
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,852
Everyone except one
who was 25 minutes late.

692
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,312
Bong-su too?

693
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,480
Bong-su?

694
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,775
The boss gave him a secret assignment.

695
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,861
That's so weird.

696
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,780
You felt it too, right?
They're strangely close.

697
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,531
Why? Why are they close?

698
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,575
They're completely different and have

699
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,576
nothing in common.

700
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,745
You're really hyper today.

701
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,707
Good. Split the search term articles
with me. Okay?

702
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,001
Hey, Yeong-sin.

703
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,796
Why that inconsiderate little...

704
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,093
Seriously?

705
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,012
Based on my research,
the Prosecutors' Office

706
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,056
should have your dad's records.

707
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,601
It's from the 90s,
so it should be kept on paper.

708
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,897
I doubt you're planning
to get it legitimately.

709
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,817
Shouldn't you go at night?

710
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,820
It's tougher at night
because security is tighter.

711
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,989
Let's try what we usually do first.

712
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:47,575
I'll search the database.
You look for a way in.

713
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,124
Hello.

714
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,511
-Are you headed to Archives?
-Yes.

715
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,096
Can you take these too?

716
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,143
Oh no. I'm so sorry.

717
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,603
I'm sorry.

718
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,732
No, Son Heung-min scored
12 goals with Hamburg.

719
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,859
He only scored 10 with Leverkusen.

720
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:06,154
That's right. Hamburg.
I keep getting confused.

721
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,739
This way. Careful.

722
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,743

723
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:29,260
Seo Jun-seok. Case number 92-8273

724
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,304
First, look for cases from 1992.

725
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,724
CASE FILES

726
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,484
CASE FILE

727
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:05,922
It's empty?

728
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,758
No police reports,
witness statements, nothing?

729
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,928
It's as I expected.

730
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,056
They moved it already.

731
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,060
So, if someone moved it, that means

732
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,188
I need to find out who that was.

733
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,108
I have a few ideas,

734
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,360
but I'm not sure which one it was.

735
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,195
So I'll have to find out.

736
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,865
What do you intend to do?

737
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,784
I intend to do it well.

738
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,121
Jeong-hu.

739
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,210
What will you do?

740
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,212
You said they show case files

741
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,214
to family members, right?

742
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,632
Have you lost your mind?

743
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,634
I'm immediate family.

744
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,345
My dad's immediate family.

745
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,931
You've lost your mind.

746
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,726
He has lost it completely...

747
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,022

748
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,776

Are you Seo Jeong-hu?

752
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,425
Yes, that's me.

Yes? What is it?

757
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,415
Please hold.

758
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,127
Sir.

759
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:13,341
Someone asked to access
Seo Jun-seok's case file.

760
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,677
Who?

761
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,012
It's Seo Jun-seok's son.

762
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,393
How should we proceed?

763
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,786
Are you Seo Jeong-hu?

764
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,845
-Is this it?
-Yes.

765
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,893
Half pork and
half kimchi dumplings, right?

766
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,813
You have to reimburse me this time!

767
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:12,400
He better not try
to sneak his way out of it again.

768
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:15,153
Haven't I brought him enough dumplings?

769
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,196
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin?

770
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,366
-Yes?
-I'm Kim Mun-sik.

771
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,368
I am Reporter Kim Mun-ho's brother.

772
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,748
Then Jeil News'--

773
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:30,335
I've heard a lot about you.

774
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,879
Hello.

775
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,818
You're Seo Jun-seok's son, correct?

776
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,487
I've seen this face before.

777
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:43,157
Why didn't you tell me who Yeong-sin was?

778
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,576
Because I have to protect her.

779
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,370
I like Yeong-sin.

780
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,039
Don't tell me to run away.

781
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,958
How dare you meet her.

782
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,544
How could you not tremble
or fall to your knees?

783
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,380
Did you bring Seo Jeong-hu?

784
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,424
What did you people do?

785
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:02,427
What did you do to us?

786
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,178
Healer, where are you?
