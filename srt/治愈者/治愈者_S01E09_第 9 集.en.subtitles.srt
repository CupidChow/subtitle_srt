1
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,017
Ji-an!

2
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,104
Ji-an!

3
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,856
Ji-an.

4
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,026
Are you okay?

5
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,362
Are you okay?

6
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,033
Say something.

7
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,245
Mr. Kim...

8
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,915
Yes, it's me. Look at me.

9
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,001
You said to come to the roof,

10
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,588
so I tried to do so,

11
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,133
but the elevator broke.

12
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,177
I would have fallen and died.

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,013
But he...

14
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,017
He showed up and saved me.

15
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,812
I couldn't see his face,

16
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,648
but I saw him. It was Healer.

17
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,899
You know of him, right?

18
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,618
Okay. You're fine now.

19
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,831
He almost died because of me.

20
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,584
He almost died.

21
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,593
Can you walk?

22
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,597
Let's go.

23
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,182
Come with me.

24
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,729
What is it?

25
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,106
Yeong-sin?

26
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,191
My phone.

27
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:13,985
What?

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,236
My phone.

29
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,991
That was my mom's. I can't lose it.

30
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,205
It must be there. In the elevator.

31
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,709
Let's go for now.

32
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,629
We'll get it later. Okay?

33
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,590
Let's head back down.

34
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,022
Someone definitely

35
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,233
sabotaged the elevator.

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,402
Seeing how it broke and fell right then,

37
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,279
he must've been close.

38
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,658
The bastard

39
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,911
did it knowing it was Yeong-sin.

40
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,246
Okay.

41
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,623
I'll look through
the security cameras nearby.

42
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,835
And about Kim Mun-ho...

43
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,755
Track him and see where he's headed.

44
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,217
In other words,
track where he's taking Chae Yeong-sin?

45
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,468
Okay.

46
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,180
I hid my babies in his phone,
so that is not a problem.

47
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,392
-But, Healer.
-What?

48
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,935
What will you be doing?

49
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,440
Me?

50
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,777
I need to find something.

51
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,371
What was that?

52
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
Healer?

53
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,667
Healer?

54
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,086
Hello?

55
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,047
Oh...

56
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,716
I...

57
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,135
I tripped.

58
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,304
You tripped? You?

59
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,099
You never do
even if someone ties to trip you,

60
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,851
but you tripped on your own?

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,146
And what's wrong with your vitals?

62
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,064
Your heart rate is completely...

63
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,051
Yeong-sin.

64
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,897
Do you know how to check vitals?

65
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,441
A family member is sick, so I learned it.

66
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,238
Are you okay?

67
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,282
I'm fine.

68
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,909
Would you like to see a doctor?

69
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,119
I'm not hurt.

70
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,124
You were having difficulty breathing.

71
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,173
Right, yes. Briefly. I was in shock.

72
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,258
But I'm fine now.

73
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,887
Okay.

74
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,600
Did you meet the informant?

75
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,310
Shouldn't you meet him?

76
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,270
Is that what I said on the phone?

77
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,189
That I'm meeting an informant?

78
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,817
You were meeting an informant
regarding Kim Ui-chan,

79
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,026
so I was to hurry over.

80
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,027
What else?

81
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,448
I was to turn off my phone
in case someone tracks me.

82
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,617
-That wasn't me.
-Pardon?

83
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,452
Someone was faking my voice

84
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,287
to draw you out here.

85
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,457
It sounded just like you though.

86
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,501
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,340
-For what?
-They used you to send me a warning.

88
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:08,886
So,

89
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,307
someone pretended to be you, drew me out,

90
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,310
and broke the elevator on purpose to...

91
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,356
No way.

92
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,611
Let's go to my place.
Your house is dangerous.

93
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,365
It's a stand-alone house,
so anyone can go in and out.

94
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,617
How do you know where I live?

95
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,121
I told you, I ran a background check.

96
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,629
Wow.

97
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,883
Is this a penthouse?

98
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,596
I didn't think people
actually lived in these places.

99
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,515
Wow, look at the view.

100
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,776
If you see this every day,
wouldn't you go crazy?

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,945
You stayed up all night, didn't you?

102
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,450
I dozed off for about an hour and a half.

103
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,536
And you almost died 40 minutes ago.

104
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,997
Right, yes.

105
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,336
Are you not fazed easily
or are you just dense?

106
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,717
Actually, I want to sing right now,

107
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,344
but I'm holding it in.

108
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,973
You can drink, right?
I'll add some liquor to yours.

109
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,229
Also,

110
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,608
I want to ask something,
but I'm holding it in.

111
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,364
Why is someone sending you a warning

112
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,367
and what do you mean they used me?

113
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,619
And earlier,

114
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,997
you called me by a different name.

115
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,416
Was it Ji-eun?

116
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,713
Did I?

117
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,507
You did.

118
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,345
Was it Ji-yeon?
Anyway, it was something like that.

119
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,471
It's Ji-an.

120
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,351
Oh Ji-an.

121
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,521
She's someone I knew.

122
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,482
I was flustered and it just came out.

123
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,656
Drink. It will help you fall asleep.

124
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,199
Please tell me what you know.

125
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,451
I need to know. I really almost died.

126
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,662
Later. You should sleep for now.

127
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,123
Then I'll go home.

128
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,584
I told you, your house is dangerous.

129
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,168
I'll be fine.

130
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,631
That man, Healer, will protect me.

131
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,718
He even saved me
from a falling elevator. So--

132
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,178
You said you investigated Healer,

133
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,807
so you should know he's a hired gun.

134
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,352
He has one standard. Money.

135
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,146
If someone offers him more tomorrow,

136
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,772
he'll naturally switch sides.

137
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,191
What's good, bad or just
doesn't mean a thing to him.

138
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,235
That's why he can do what he does.

139
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,404
-Don't trust him.
-Still...

140
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,411
You have a slight fever.

141
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,580
Get some sleep.

142
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,375
-But I--
-Please, for me.

143
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,297
If you don't,
I'll be too nervous to go out.

144
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,383
I need to go somewhere right now,

145
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,643
so get some sleep.

146
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,987
If you're listening,
I wanted to tell you this.

147
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,698
You protected her today.

148
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,868
Thank you.

149
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,204
We can call it danger pay,

150
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,915
or a token of appreciation.

151
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,960
I'll deposit a generous amount.

152
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,841
However, I do have one more request.

153
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,639
If you get an offer from the other side

154
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,935
and choose to stand against me,

155
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,148
please inform me of it.

156
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,484
I've been a regular client after all.

157
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,612
It's not much to ask.

158
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,739
"Trust me. Trust me just once.

159
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,910
Then you will be able to trust
more and more."

160
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,246
That is what Dad said back then

161
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,665
when he was a stranger.

162
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:19,173
You don't know it, but I'm a robot.

163
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,843
If you don't like me... You see this?

164
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,554
Here. You see this mole here?

165
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,225
If you don't like me, press here. Then...

166
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,311
You see how I'm moving? If you press it,

167
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,730
I become like this. I can't move. See?

168
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,359
I can't move. Do you want to try?
Go on. Try it.

169
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,945
Then you'd be able to believe me.

170
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,446
There's no point.

171
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,407
She crawls into
any hole or crack she finds

172
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,201
and stays there all day.

173
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,744
Does she understand me?

174
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,664
She can hear. She just can't speak.

175
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:55,709
I've never really gotten
a good look of her face either.

176
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,836
We leave her food at the opening here,

177
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,382
she eats when no one is around,
and then she goes and hides again.

178
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,718
Then where does she sleep?

179
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,806
That's the real problem
because winter will soon deepen.

180
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,809
We even forced her to stay in a room

181
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,602
but she's so quick that

182
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,814
she escapes like a squirrel
and hides here.

183
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,233
I can't blame her.

184
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,611
As you've heard,
she was in really bad shape

185
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,738
when she was first brought in.

186
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,824
She had bruises all over her body

187
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,451
and multiple broken bones.

188
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,668
Lee Jeong-seon and Han Young-ae
were incredible,

189
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,088
but another joined the group. Guess who?

190
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,175
It was none other than Kim Hyun-shik.
Do you know him?

191
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,927
You must know Kim Hyun-shik.

192
00:14:53,559 --> 00:15:00,441
When I walked into the alley

193
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,821
My heart was racing

194
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:12,703
Your curtains were drawn

195
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:20,252
Still, I stared silently at your window

196
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:27,635
When the rain falls and music flows

197
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,013
I think

198
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,313
Of you

199
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:45,736
On the night you left

200
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,988
It rained...

201
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,494
Just like this

202
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,956
Today

203
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,251
I walk in the rain

204
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,798
It's not like the world became

205
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,593
more trustworthy after meeting my dad.

206
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,103
When I wasn't careful,
someone stabbed me in the back.

207
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,688
When I opened my heart,

208
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,315
someone crawled in and left a scar.

209
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,518
But I was fine.

210
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,605
If you have just one person
you can fully trust,

211
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,649
even if you are stabbed in the back,

212
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,901
the injury won't be too bad.

213
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,380
That's how I was.

214
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,468
That's why it is easier for me
to trust someone now

215
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,344
rather than distrust them.

216
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,806
Let's go.

217
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:44,897
When I walked into the alley

218
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,693
My heart was racing

219
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:56,658
Your curtains were drawn

220
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,872
I was lost for words like a fool

221
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,040
Gosh, my legs.

222
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:08,378
I could not say anything to you

223
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:14,009
And regretted it when we parted

224
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,723
Mun-ho!

225
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,476
Go inside, Myeong-hui.

226
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,019
What's going on?

227
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,398
I need to talk to Mun-sik.
I don't want you to hear us,

228
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,901
so don't come any closer.

229
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,994
What do you think you are doing?

230
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,886
Look who's talking? What have you done?

231
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,138
What is it?

232
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,682
Have you chosen to be inhumane?

233
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,934
Look me in the eye and answer me.

234
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,940
What are you if not a human being?

235
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,442
What are you talking about?

236
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,453
Did you have him do it again?

237
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,914
You don't like getting your hands dirty.

238
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,044
Do you know what he's talking about?

239
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,714
You shouldn't have touched Ji-an.

240
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,676
You did it expecting to end it all, right?

241
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,971
Fine, let's end it all tonight.

242
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,055
Did you

243
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,559
just say "Ji-an"?

244
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,401
When you said she was dead
when she wasn't, I could understand.

245
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,738
You did it to save Myeong-hui
who didn't want to live.

246
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,947
But...

247
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,701
So, Ji-an is alive?

248
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,245
You found her?

249
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,749
That's why you ran in here and...

250
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,085
What are you accusing me of?

251
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,213
You think I did something to her...

252
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,592
Enough. You make me sick.

253
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,513
I didn't know.

254
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,892
I mean it. I didn't know.

255
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,068
If it wasn't you,

256
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,281
was it Boss, the man you serve?

257
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,034
Was he sending me a message?

258
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,286
-Mun-ho--
-Listen.

259
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,330
If anyone

260
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,084
ever lays a finger on Ji-an again,

261
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,880
Myeong-hui will be the first to find out.

262
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,216
That's your biggest fear, isn't it?

263
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,677
Myeong-hui finding out the truth.

264
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,144
You're crossing the line.

265
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,731
You're using Myeong-hui to threaten me?

266
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,192
I have no choice.

267
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,236
I love Myeong-hui too.

268
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,990
You want me to just watch Myeong-hui

269
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,370
live with the man who hurt her daughter?

270
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,665
Do you really think that I will?

271
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,005
I can't do that.

272
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,897
Did you brothers argue again?

273
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,818
Look at your face. Have you had dinner?

274
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,446
I will give you something to drink
for now.

275
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,786
You look like you were lost
in a desert for a week.

276
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,080
You look extremely gaunt.

277
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,176
Come on. My arm hurts.

278
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,514
Let me heat up some food. Just a minute.

279
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,860
-Myeong-hui.
-What?

280
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,446
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,740
For what?

282
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,660
Mun-ho. You can cry.

283
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,412
You can cry in front of me.

284
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,956
It'll be our little secret.

285
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,092
It's okay.

286
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,510
No.

287
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,931
It isn't okay.

288
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,060
I know, so it's okay.

289
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,692
You must be really upset.

290
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,240
Whatever it is, it will be all right.

291
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,701
Trust me, okay?

292
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,995
Mun-ho.

293
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,522
Tell me.

294
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,775
What's going on?

295
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,491
It was Boss' order.

296
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:19,166
Tell me exactly what that order was.

297
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,169
What did he order you to do?

298
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,047
What did he want you to do

299
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,134
after you find that child?

300
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,512
What have you been doing

301
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,098
behind my back?

302
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,433
That is...

303
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,151
This is Healer headquarters.

304
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,321
Your deadline
to turn over Ko Seong-cheol's killer

305
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,114
to the police is approaching.

306
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,783
If you fail to complete your mission,

307
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,452
these are the TV stations on which

308
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,704
that problematic video will be aired.

309
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,081
-Assistant Oh.
-The main news

310
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,333
-of major TV stations.
-Yes, sir.

311
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,794
-I need to meet Boss. Set it up.
-Variety shows with top ratings

312
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,840
-of public and cable channels.
-Yes, sir.

313
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:09,841
Also...

314
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,971
If it airs during a show,
will many people get angry?

315
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,349
Anyway, this is what we are going to do.

316
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:21,895
We've prepared a nice trailer
to draw more viewers,

317
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,564
so please tune in.

318
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,529
Testing. One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

319
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,658
All I know is love

320
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,331
Dae-yong? Little one?

321
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,375
-Yes, Boss.
-What are you doing?

322
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,086
-I'm on a stakeout.
-What stakeout?

323
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:50,548
I was told to stake out
Chae Yeong-sin's house.

324
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,510
-Where's Healer?
-Ask him yourself.

325
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,346
It's not like he'd tell me if I asked,

326
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,556
and I wouldn't understand
even if he did tell me.

327
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:03,270
Anyway, who's paying
for my overtime though?

328
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:08,692
Hello? Boss? My overtime...

329
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,953
Healer, you punk.
Why did you turn off the radio?

330
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:24,666
I said not to turn it off
no matter what you're doing.

331
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,543
It's me.

332
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,462
Yeong-jae?

333
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,257
Why are you there?
That's Jeong-hu's house.

334
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,302
This was my house first.

335
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,555
That isn't a house.
It's an abandoned warehouse

336
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,265
that Jeong-hu turned into a home.

337
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,058
So, is Jeong-hu there or not?

338
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,143
He's not here.

339
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,481
He had so many locks on the door

340
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,401
that it took me all day to break in.

341
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:56,197
So why did you go there?
He doesn't let anyone in.

342
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,991
Even I don't touch his place.

343
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,160
-Detective Jo.
-What?

344
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,288
I have a favor to ask.

345
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,416
I don't do favors for anyone.

346
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,835
I do accept job offers though.
How much is it worth?

347
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,420
Kim Mun-sik's brother, Mun-ho.

348
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,298
You bugged his cell phone, right?

349
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,841
I did. So?

350
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,219
Go through his emails and stuff.
I need to check something.

351
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,512
Check what?

352
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,058
You said Mun-ho requested a DNA sample?

353
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,267
He did.

354
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,145
And it was to find
a daughter of someone's?

355
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,357
Yes, a girl in her late 20s.

356
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,067
And she was an orphan?

357
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,153
Yes, she became an orphan in 1992.

358
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,659
Then there is only one person
Mun-ho would search for.

359
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,250
Myeong-hui and Gil-han's daughter,
Oh Ji-an.

360
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,814
Hello?

361
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,735
Sorry, I think I dialed
the wrong number. Sorry.

362
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,227
-Hello?
-Yes! I got it right.

363
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,603
I'm good with numbers.

364
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,481
I knew I'd remember your number.

365
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,149
Aren't you impressed?

366
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,862
What happened to your cell phone?

367
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,865
I lost it.

368
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:31,204
I'm seeing how many numbers I can recall.

369
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,540
So how many do you remember?

370
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,794
Well, you are

371
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,296
the 19th, I think.

372
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,677
I'm honored.

373
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,221
I made it in the top 20.

374
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,225
I called you recently, remember?

375
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,310
So it stayed in my brain.

376
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,896
Anyway,

377
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,190
were you sleeping? You sound groggy.

378
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,817
Look at the time.

379
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,239
Good kids are tucked in by now.

380
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,285
Right, sorry. I guess I woke you up.

381
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,037
Then go back to sleep.

382
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,874
I...

383
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,922
I'm wide awake now.

384
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,509
Do you have something to say?

385
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,887
You moron.

386
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:33,725
That's not a nice thing to say.

387
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,560
Just speak casually.

388
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,855
-What do you mean?
-You may speak casually.

389
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,940
You keep going back and forth
which is confusing.

390
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,650
Okay.

391
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,571
But you still better show me respect.

392
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,489
Having respect for your senior reporter

393
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,533
makes this society beautiful.

394
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,204
To celebrate my speaking casually to you,

395
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,749
I'll listen to you all night long.

396
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,917
About what?

397
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,587
Didn't you call because
you needed someone to talk to?

398
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,884
Wow, you're pretty quick.

399
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,844
Are you outside?

400
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,890
Isn't it cold?

401
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,767
It is.

402
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,647
I lost my phone, so I'm even colder.

403
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,900
A phone isn't a hot pack or anything.

404
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,820
It was a hot pack to me
because it belonged to my mom.

405
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,698
Ever since she passed away,

406
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,784
it has been warming my heart.

407
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,500
So it was your mother's.

408
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,502
No wonder.

409
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,130
I wondered why you use an antique.

410
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,300
On a cold day like this,

411
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,303
when my heart is cold,

412
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,685
I'd hold it tightly in my hand.

413
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,603
It would

414
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,940
really get warm.

415
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,747
If it gets hot even without making a call,

416
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,877
that means it's time to get rid of it
and get a new one.

417
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,381
I can't believe you want to be a reporter

418
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,550
when you're unromantic and unimaginative.

419
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,853
It's cold. You should go home.

420
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,313
If I go home now,

421
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,900
my dad will ask me 175 questions.

422
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,445
I don't have the energy to deal with that.

423
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,990
Don't you feel well?

424
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,452
Actually,

425
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,663
that is just an excuse.

426
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,375
I'm waiting for someone.

427
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,129
You're waiting?

428
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,175
I thought if I waited like this,
I could see him.

429
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:21,100
I thought he'd appear right behind me.

430
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,982
But he isn't coming.

431
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,700
I'm sure

432
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,162
he has something to say to me.

433
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,043
He can't not say anything like this.

434
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,548
I'm...

435
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,887
ready to listen to him.

436
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,730
I have a lot to say too.

437
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,609
But he isn't coming.

438
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,863
I guess he won't come anymore.

439
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,800
TEST RESULT

440
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,431
Shit, this is bad.

441
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,520
This is fucked up.

442
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,105
What are you talking about?

443
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,233
-Hey, Yeong-jae.
-What?

444
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,778
You said Jeong-hu's dad did something bad.

445
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,737
Yes.

446
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,032
Did he murder his friend?

447
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,285
That's what people said.

448
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:06,497
If what you say is true,
then the man he killed is

449
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,249
Chae Yeong-sin's biological father.

450
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,754
After his mom left,

451
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,132
Jeong-hu thought women

452
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:23,347
were like gum on the street. But he
finally started to like someone, right?

453
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,435
Is that the girl?

454
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,854
Yes.

455
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,106
Chi-su! Yeong-sin is back!

456
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,983
-Chi-su!
-Stop that.

457
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,653
-It's Yeong-sin.
-Dad.

458
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,614
Do you know what time it is?

459
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,990
Why didn't you answer your phone?

460
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,577
Dad, it's a long story.
Can we talk inside?

461
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,496
Why don't you talk inside?

462
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,499
Do you know how many times
the paper called for you?

463
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,125
You brat.

464
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,003
Don't you think of your family
worrying at home?

465
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,131
Don't you see her face is blue
from the cold weather?

466
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,134
It's so cold.
I'm going to freeze to death.

467
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,136
Freeze to death?
Where do you think you're going?

468
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,056
-Yeong-sin is freezing to death.
-Home. Where else?

469
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,101
Explain everything in detail
so I can understand.

470
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,812
Come on, this isn't a courtroom.

471
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,147
-Yeong-sin, go in. Quickly.
-Thanks.

472
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,315
Hurry on in.

473
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,944
I know you told me to get some sleep,

474
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,114
but I can't sleep unless
I'm in my own bed at home.

475
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:06,492
So I'm going home
in order to obey your orders.

476
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,328
Don't you worry.
This is Chae Yeong-sin reporting.

477
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,843
DETECTIVE YOON DONG-WON

478
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,809
Shoot.

479
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,314
Yoon Dong-won speaking.

480
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,901
I'm sorry to call at this hour.
I'm Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

481
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,069
Pardon?

482
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,365
Why would a reporter call... Kim Mun-ho?

483
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,117
Are you free to talk?

484
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,286
Wow, his voice sounds exactly like on TV.

485
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,206
Why yes. It's an honor. Yes.

486
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,960
If we meet, may I get an autograph?

487
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,339
I have a junior reporter under me.
Her name is Chae Yeong-sin.

488
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,133
She told me about you.

489
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,260
Do you remember her?

490
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,930
Chae Yeong-sin? Right, from Someday News.

491
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,768
Yes, of course I do.
I saw her at Hwang Je-guk's house.

492
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,063
I wanted to send you the videos found in

493
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,814
Hwang Je-guk's house.

494
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,899
Videos?

495
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,193
They are of actresses in his agency

496
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,904
servicing various men.

497
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,282
It's related to a story
we are investigating.

498
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,909
I see.

499
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:34,330
But there must have been some confusion.

500
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,166
I'm in the Cyber Crimes Division,

501
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:41,921
so I deal with incidents
occurring in cyberspace.

502
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:45,216
Another division handles sexual crimes.

503
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,012
The men in the videos
hold very high positions.

504
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,682
I'm afraid they would be covered up

505
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,683
during an investigation.

506
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,810
I see.

507
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:01,565
But I'm an outcast too,
so I don't have much power.

508
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,193
I obtained the videos by hiring

509
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,987
Healer, the man for hire.

510
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,949
Did you just say "Healer"?

511
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,034
I heard you've been chasing him for years.

512
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,121
Yes, many years.

513
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:19,625
I know who Healer will be hanging around.

514
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,794
Who?

515
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,337
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

516
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,675
He received a request to protect her,

517
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,138
but the other side will probably
hire him soon.

518
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,392
The people they hired
lost to Healer recently.

519
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,229
Do you mean Hwang Je-guk?

520
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,106
I'm sure there is more behind him.

521
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,524
So,

522
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:49,029
who are you interested in?
Hwang Je-guk or Healer?

523
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,449
Once you start your investigation,
I'd like copies of

524
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,494
what you find on Hwang Je-guk
and those backing him.

525
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,829
And?

526
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:02,460
I want undercover detectives
to stay near Yeong-sin.

527
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,253
Don't you want

528
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,381
to catch Healer?

529
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,261
INFIRMARY

530
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,088
That old geezer.

531
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,404
Come out. Now!

532
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,242
You old geezer. I know you're still here.

533
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,010
I need to talk to you, you old geezer!

534
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,431
Show your face while I'm being nice.

535
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,476
If I catch you hiding,
I'm going to kill you.

536
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,564
I have something to ask you,
so come out here!

537
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,650
You're my master!

538
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,986
Since you're my master,

539
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,612
I have...

540
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,673
I have something to ask you.

541
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,303
I really don't know.

542
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,180
What am I supposed to do?

543
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,310
What should I do, Master?

544
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,481
I wish

545
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,110
you'd tell me.

546
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,599
Hello.

547
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:09,188
I'm sorry for just leaving yesterday.

548
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,440
I left a note--

549
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,484
I'm the one who should apologize.

550
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,281
I can breathe again
now that I've seen you.

551
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,367
Pardon?

552
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,919
MINION

553
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,271
I sent someone to look,

554
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:35,732
but there was no phone in the elevator.

555
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,109
I see.

556
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,821
You didn't have to do that, but thank you.

557
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,698
Here.

558
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,033
It's a new phone.

559
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,161
No, I can get one myself.

560
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,329
It's company property,
so be careful with it.

561
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,123
I see.

562
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,418
Thank you.

563
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,338
I thought about it all night.

564
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,799
What should I do with you?

565
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,386
I'll be more careful from now on.

566
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,222
There is only so much I can do
to protect you.

567
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,349
So, if you would tell me

568
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:13,145
who is trying to hurt me and why, I'll--

569
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,439
I thought of two options.

570
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,150
A, I send you far away.

571
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,322
I could send you
to study abroad in Europe.

572
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:26,575
It sounds like a line from a TV show,

573
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,453
and you're saying it so seriously.

574
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,332
Your jokes are so old.

575
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,918
I figured you'd react that way.

576
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,545
Then there's the second option.

577
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,591
-I make you very famous.
-Excuse me?

578
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:46,386
If you become respected
and many people know of you,

579
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,473
they can't pull something like
the elevator incident

580
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,850
because they won't be able
to bury it quietly.

581
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,523
Your dream is to become
a famous journalist anyway.

582
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,899
How did you...

583
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,485
Right. The background check.

584
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,780
Of course, becoming famous
may put you in more danger.

585
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,785
I don't know, so you decide.

586
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:13,330
If you're scared,
run away while you can. I'll help.

587
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,666
When will you tell me the reason?

588
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,251
Why am I in danger?

589
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,462
If I say it's because you're with me,

590
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,965
can you accept that much for now?

591
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,596
A famous reporter?

592
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,806
Yes.

593
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,684
I'll do it.

594
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:43,694
You lost nothing. No one saw a thief.

595
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:49,241
Detective, I don't know what you heard,

596
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:53,453
but didn't you see my guys outside?

597
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,249
I have ironclad security.

598
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,252
What thief could get in?

599
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:03,463
It looks like a frame used to be here.

600
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,718
What happened to the painting
that was here?

601
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,637
I sold it. Happy?

602
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,265
I see, you sold it.

603
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,809
Then I'll pass on the thief story.

604
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,436
Next.

605
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,232
The women in these videos are

606
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,735
all within your agency, correct?

607
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,990
This is the least obscene one.

608
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:34,911
I skimmed through them and... My God.

609
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,331
I couldn't watch it all.

610
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,750
What is this?

611
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:44,212
What the hell have those brats been doing?

612
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,257
I know, right? What did they do and where?

613
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,760
Let's look into it together.

614
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:54,890
On that note, you need to
come to the station tomorrow.

615
00:48:55,265 --> 00:49:00,896
I have many questions to ask you,
especially about these gentlemen

616
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,732
of various positions and status.

617
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,780
It's good for a hangover. Try it.

618
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,615
Boss..

619
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,494
-That girl...
-I was wrong.

620
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,623
I should have asked your permission first.

621
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,876
I was wrong to decide on my own

622
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,337
to hurt the girl.

623
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,884
Since you say that,
I don't know what to say.

624
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,887
-But--
-But?

625
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,555
You know, don't you?

626
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,642
Why I had to go so far

627
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,269
for such a young girl.

628
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,522
Are you worried about Mun-ho?

629
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,273
Reporter Kim Mun-ho has been

630
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:49,319
on my tail for over 10 years.

631
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,655
Even with Samhan Heavy Industries

632
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,825
which we worked on recently,

633
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:59,538
Kim Mun-ho was on top of us
as soon as we made our move.

634
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,666
But the most he could do was

635
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,836
babble a few comments on a live show.

636
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,630
He is one reporter in all of Korea.

637
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,427
What could he do that
could possible concern you?

638
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,636
That is why

639
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,515
I wanted to bring him over to our side.

640
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,017
But he left the station and started

641
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,645
his own newspaper company.

642
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,022
You can't really call it
a newspaper company.

643
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:30,944
That LA video you obtained last time...

644
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:36,950
He tried to intercept it, did he not?

645
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,995
If that had reached Kim Mun-ho's hand,

646
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,081
what would have happened?

647
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,417
I was handling it.

648
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,503
I would not have made a mistake.

649
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,921
I know.

650
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:55,635
You're the best I have.
You're one of a kind.

651
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:01,391
But why did I push Kim Ui-chan

652
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,395
instead of you for mayor?

653
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,564
Boss, I...

654
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,984
It was because of your weaknesses.

655
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,779
You have two very big weaknesses.

656
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,700
Your wife and your brother.

657
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,121
We can't add the girl as a third weakness.

658
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,874
I know my weaknesses well.

659
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:30,086
That is why I've never wanted more than

660
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,005
what you've given me.

661
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,132
But Boss,

662
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,468
my weaknesses are

663
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,137
fatal.

664
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,599
If I get hurt,
it'll be impossible to recover.

665
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,684
I will die.

666
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,521
I assume you won't have

667
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,274
any use for a dead soldier either.

668
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,784
I'll take care of my problems.

669
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,537
I'll do it myself

670
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:08,250
and decide how it'll be done too.

671
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,586
I earnestly

672
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,589
ask this of you, sir.

673
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,063
Hello?

674
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,149
Let me talk to Boss.

675
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,827
-Who is this?
-I'm Hwang Je-guk.

676
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,539
I know I called the place where Boss is,

677
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:51,042
so get him on the phone
while I'm being nice.

678
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,087
How did you get this number?

679
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:59,551
Exactly! I have enough connections
to get this number,

680
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:03,179
and I'm in a bad spot right now.

681
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,599
If I'm caught,

682
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,642
I won't go down alone.

683
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,728
I have a big mouth, you know.

684
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,646
So I'll blab and blab.

685
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,191
I don't know whose names I'll blurt out.

686
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,028
The problem is, among those names are

687
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,864
many of Boss' people.

688
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,616
Do you know what I'm getting at?

689
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:27,746
So, get Boss on the phone
before it's too late!

690
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,916
I understand.

691
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,043
I'll relay the message.

692
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,214
Please wait, and you'll hear from him.

693
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:54,564
Who was the man that brought the LA video

694
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,899
and was killed?

695
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,984
It's Ko Seong-cheol.

696
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,903
You said

697
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,157
you need his killer, correct?

698
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,037
Okay! Listen up.

699
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,082
Kim Ui-chan will hold
a press conference at 4 p.m.

700
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,833
announcing his candidacy for mayor.

701
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,169
Simultaneously, Someday
will premier "Someday News,"

702
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,796
an online news program.

703
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,715
The press conference will be included,

704
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,176
as well as the material
that we have collected.

705
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,220
Yes?

706
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,890
Isn't it too strong to start off
with Kim Ui-chan?

707
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,643
Maybe we should begin softly?

708
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,646
Like a warm up?
A practice game, something like that?

709
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,315
Why must we start off with Kim Ui-chan?

710
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,150
To sell.

711
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,610
To sell?

712
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,572
Not because of our calling
as reporters or anything,

713
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,490
but to sell?

714
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,034
The calling of reporters is useless

715
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,869
if no one watches us.

716
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,748
If it's Kim Ui-chan,
a lead candidate for Seoul mayor,

717
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,333
don't you think it will sell well?

718
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,878
If it's something this big,
I need to do my spy work.

719
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:02,048
Do it. Just do it on your way there.
We have no time.

720
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,759
Jong-su, your mission is to

721
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,720
get a seat at the press conference.

722
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,389
The best spot to broadcast live.

723
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:12,892
Oh no.

724
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,311
Our screen quality will be horrible.

725
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,814
Since we've never even practiced before,

726
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,691
we will make many mistakes.

727
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:23,361
Check the connections.
Unplug and plug them back in.

728
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,823
We don't even have a broadcast van,
but let's do it.

729
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,118
If we don't try,
we won't know where to improve.

730
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:36,124
We'll learn fighting skills
not in a warm gym,

731
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:39,127
but in a cold open market
with the wind blowing.

732
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:44,049
I was late looking for this.

733
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,341
Where...

734
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,304
The cameraman is here.
They just left together.

735
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,432
Here.

736
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:53,808
Let's go.

737
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,811
-Where are we going?
-To become famous.

738
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,188
What?

739
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:20,043
Look into everyone around Chae Yeong-sin.

740
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,377
Her colleagues' details

741
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,129
will be in their human resources files.

742
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,175
Yes, address, work experience,
things like that?

743
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,260
Height, weight, and build too.

744
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,679
And pictures. Don't forget those.

745
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,724
What are you talking about now?

746
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,810
What? What is it?

747
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,354
-We have a problem.
-What problem?

748
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,235
Please tell us again. Everyone is here.

749
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,986
I can't get in.

750
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,739
What do you mean? Can't go in where?

751
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,784
They're only letting in reporters
on the list.

752
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,286
Newspapers and stations not on the list

753
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,873
can't even go into the room,
let alone ask questions.

754
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:03,253
A business card from Someday or Monday
won't cut it.

755
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,921
What should we do?

756
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:08,633
How could they discriminate
in this day and age of

757
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,051
freedom of the press?

758
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,763
Let me talk to the person in charge!

759
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:14,889
How dare they!

760
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,808
They'll only take and answer

761
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,352
questions they wrote themselves.

762
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,565
It's to prevent any questions
about Joo Yeon-hui.

763
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,320
Jong-su.

764
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,116
Turn the camera back. Back pan. Back pan.

765
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,994
Right there. Zoom in.

766
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,748
ENGAGEMENT PARTY

767
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,877
The son of DK's CEO Kim Se-gwang is

768
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,754
having his engagement party
in the next room.

769
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,298
Do you know them?

770
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,759
They can't stop their guests that easily.

771
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,980
Right, it's my cell phone.

772
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,483
Look, it's new.

773
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,111
Go figure.

774
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,447
How do I answer this?

775
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,158
You don't even know how to use it.

776
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,951
Hello?

777
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,536
Yes, Mr. Kim.

778
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,498
This is my first call on this phone.

779
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,833
It's a smart phone, so I didn't...

780
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,835
Excuse me?

781
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,756
Go undercover? Us?

782
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,426
Stop by where first?

783
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,305
So make them look so dignified and fancy

784
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:42,810
that no one could
dare refuse them, is that it?

785
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,063
Okay.

786
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,483
That must be them now.

787
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,569
I have to go. I'm suddenly eager to work.

788
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,241
Hello.

789
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,993
Reporter Kim Mun-ho sent you, correct?

790
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,496
Yes. He said to stop by on our way--

791
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,580
Hush!

792
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,582
Come.

793
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,130
I think I should wait...

794
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,091
-Stay here.
-Outside.

795
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,592
Shall we begin?

796
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,929
Wait, but...

797
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,062
Where are you...

798
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,983
We're going undercover
which is my expertise.

799
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,569
Reporters must be able to

800
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,446
transform instantly into anyone necessary.

801
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,365
I know a lot about transforming too.

802
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,409
I've always done it on my own.

803
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,454
So I don't need... My goodness.

804
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,290
You startled me.

805
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,251
Bong-suk.

806
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:52,463
Don't talk to me right now.
I'm not in the mood.

807
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,132
Why? Didn't you sleep well?

808
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,425
No, not at all.

809
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:59,304
Why not? Right, because I woke you up?

810
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,224
I had a lot on my mind.

811
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,519
Goodness, my little Bong-suk
knows how to think?

812
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:11,316
I thought a lot.

813
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,525
More than usual.

814
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,944
What did you think about?

815
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:20,617
Let's say I was looking for an excuse.

816
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,077
An excuse for what?

817
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,912
Well...

818
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,664
What?

819
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:34,672
An excuse to meet again.

820
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,550
To meet again? Whom?

821
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,994
Wow. It's perfect.

822
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,249
My Lady.

823
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,396
Beautiful.

824
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,370
If we are ready, shall we go now?

825
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,788
Okay. Let's go.

826
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:39,338
You must do whatever it takes
to ask your questions.

827
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,591
He just sent us a legitimate warning.

828
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,427
"Don't touch her."

829
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,096
I am Chae Yeong-sin.

830
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,724
Will you please meet me?

831
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,185
My dad was a murderer.

832
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,687
And I am a thief.

833
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,775
Good job. You did better than I expected.

834
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,902
I got a compliment.

835
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,447
Rather than waiting for someone
who isn't coming,

836
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:05,740
how about you consider me?
