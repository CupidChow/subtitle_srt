1
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,657
Go and bring him back.

SOMEDAY NEWS

3
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,041
Are you sure Kim Mun-ho was abducted?

4
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,003
Then why is he back there?

CALLER ID UNKNOWN

8
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,799
You showed up within three minutes.

9
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,011
You are Seo Jeong-hu, employed under
the fake name, Park Bong-su.

10
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,471
Your code name is Healer. Correct?

11
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,765
That...

12
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,818
And who are you?

13
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,780
I have a job request for you.
Money is not an issue.

14
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,283
No.

What do you want?

17
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,743
Among the tips Someday News received,

18
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,870
there was one from Russia.
Find it and bring it back.

19
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,498
I think you're confused.

20
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,542
The guy you have locked up over there
might know better.

21
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,127
I don't know anything about it.

22
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,547
Time is ticking. You just lost 20 seconds.

23
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,653
Excuse me.

24
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,739
What are we

25
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,076
waiting for right now?

26
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,249
Are you married? Do you have kids?

27
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,292
No.

28
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,793
I see,

29
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,254
so you're not married.

30
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,260
It's hot in here. Would you like a drink?

31
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,511
And you two...

32
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,623
What is this?

33
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,044
Ms. Jo, crack the password for me.

34
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,130
He put together all the tips we received.

35
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,382
I doubt it's in that computer.

36
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,383
How do you know?

37
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,470
-You were audited, right?
-Yes.

38
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,514
You said they copied all the hard drives.

39
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,850
They probably looked through them already.

40
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,436
They asked you
because it wasn't there. But...

41
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,403
Chae Yeong-sin's necklace was activated.

42
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,447
-From where?
-Kim Mun-ho's apartment.

43
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,241
I told her to wait there.

44
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,285
She must have pressed it by mistake.

45
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,040
Wait.

46
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,797
Sorry, wrong number.

47
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,759
This is Someday News. Do you have a tip?

48
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,887
Chae Yeong-sin and Russia.

49
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,640
Ms. Jo.

50
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,643
What does Russian sound like?

51
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,729
Do whatever the hell you want.

52
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,064
Awesome.

53
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,108
Son of a bitch.

54
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,361
You're messed up.

55
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,615
-Do you need more?
-Hold on.

56
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,993
We need to record this call. Is that okay?

57
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:04,549
-Is this Someday News?
-Sorry, wrong number.

58
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,815
Is this Someday News?

59
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,549
-Shall we begin?
-Sure.

60
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,179
I'll start the recording.
I'm Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

61
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,015
May I ask you what your name is?

62
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,934
I am calling from Russia.

63
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,645
Is this what you wanted?

64
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,813
Good work.

65
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,065
You completed the mission in five minutes.

66
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,525
You passed.

67
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,658
What, are you playing games with me?

68
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,076
Here is the second mission.

69
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,540
It's very simple.

70
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,585
Face the camera and read the message
you just received.

71
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,346
What the...

72
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,473
Goodness.

73
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,018
What am I doing with this madman?

74
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,149
Mr. Kim, I can't do it anymore.
You get yourself out.

75
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,921
Shall we continue?

76
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,930
Damn...

77
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,290
May I...

78
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,503
May I ask what that's for?

79
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,358
Are you ready?

80
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,237
I sent Dae-yong and others.
They'll be there soon.

81
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,488
Buy some time.

82
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,450
I'll give you ten seconds.

83
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,871
Tick-tock.

84
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,997
Let's begin.

85
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,501
But get that thing away from Yeong-sin.

86
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,919
It's annoying me.

87
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,940
-"My name is Seo Jeong-hu."
-Wait.

88
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,778
Put the phone down,
so it won't be on camera.

89
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,535
Good. Let's start over.

90
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,707
"My name is

91
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,292
Seo Jeong-hu.

92
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:15,841
I am the one who killed Park Dong-cheol
behind the St. Mary's Church...

93
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,596
on January 27.

94
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,227
We were fighting about his gambling debt

95
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:30,398
and I grabbed a pipe
and struck him in the head.

96
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,652
I, Seo Jeong-hu, have committed murder.

97
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,904
I confess."

98
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,251
Good work.

99
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,047
It's your turn to let them go.

100
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,634
I need to see it until the last moment.

101
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,574
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

102
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,088
Are you satisfied?

103
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,971
Now, explain what this nonsense
was all about.

104
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,264
I will connect you now.

105
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,266
Good job.

106
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:52,354
You will now work under me
and follow my orders.

107
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,774
Then I will guarantee the happiness

108
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,069
and safety of your loved ones.

109
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,114
Then I'll never have to use that video

110
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,825
we just recorded.

111
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,580
It's as easy as blinking your eyes.

112
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,292
Very simple.

113
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,511
Are you awake? Everyone is waiting.

114
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,141
Come. Sit down.

115
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:33,229
-Hey, you made it.
-Hi, Reporter Kim.

116
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,774
You've been very impressive lately.

117
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,652
What was it? Oh yes, Sunday News.

118
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,778
It's 'Someday'.

119
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,864
Sunday and Someday are very different.

120
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,325
That old story again?

121
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,535
Please come sit.

122
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,621
We're waiting for our evening snack.

123
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,667
We're having shark's fin soup.
It's very delicious.

124
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,377
They say it smells so good

125
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,797
that monks would jump
over the wall for a bite.

126
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,424
Are you behind all of this?

127
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,261
You guys were becoming a threat.

128
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,264
I had to rack my brain to save your lives.

129
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,726
Is this a celebration of
President Kim Mun-sik becoming the mayor

130
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,188
and Reporter Kim Mun-ho becoming
the president

131
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,065
of Jeil News?

132
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,942
This is an exciting moment.

133
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:25,281
You can lead Jeil's broadcasts with
skills you honed at Someday News.

134
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,243
We need young blood in the media.

135
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,247
We're all old. Let's admit it.

136
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,878
Let's drink to the new mayor
and president!

137
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,087
Cheers!

138
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,259
Smile, at least for Jeong-hu's sake.

139
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,696
No one was here when we arrived.
She was alone.

140
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,884
-You must have been terrified.
-You have no idea.

141
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,553
If you had gotten hurt,
I don't know what...

142
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,894
You were more scared than I was, right?

143
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,730
You're as pale as a ghost.

144
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,192
Are you sure you're not hurt?

145
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,152
I'm fine.

146
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,322
No one touched you?

147
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,532
They didn't push or pull you?

148
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,035
-No.
-No?

149
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,662
Good.

150
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,833
Thanks, Dae-yong. Thank the guys for me.

151
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,059
-Yeong-sin.
-What?

152
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,939
I don't think I can live
like an ordinary person for now.

153
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,691
Why not?

154
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,360
I was threatened today.

155
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,862
Threatened? How?

156
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,159
I confessed to the murder
of Park Dong-cheol.

157
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,080
That old geezer called the Boss
has the recording.

158
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,833
He said he won't hand it to the police

159
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,711
if I start working for him.

160
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,089
Why, that crazy old man...

161
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,008
No, it's okay.

162
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,929
What kind of threat made you do that?

163
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,685
-Was it because of me?
-No.

164
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,773
That's why they were filming me, right?

165
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,569
Still. How could you do that?
Have you lost your mind?

166
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,447
How could you make such a confession?

167
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,991
Murder? How could you confess to it?

168
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,667
You have lost your mind.

169
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,131
I'll never work for that old man.
I never will.

170
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,594
Don't you dare.
I'll go in and drag you out.

171
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,762
Okay.

172
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,017
So, I can't be with you
until I resolve this.

173
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,101
I need to be on the run.

174
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,103
Let's do it together.

175
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,689
I'll tell you if I need your help.

176
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,400
Stay with me. Let's do it together.

177
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,487
Then you'll be arrested as an accomplice.

178
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,241
Then how will I see you?

179
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,749
I'll disconnect my phone, so don't call.
Don't come near my place,

180
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,169
and if anyone asks about me--

181
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,754
How will I see you?

182
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,268
Myeong-hui is sleeping.

183
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,478
You can talk to her later.

184
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,324
Please, let Jeong-hu go.

185
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,868
Do you want a drink?

186
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,581
Will drinking with you be enough?
What else can I do?

187
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,833
Boss took Jeong-hu.

188
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,044
He'll take good care of him.

189
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,507
Jeong-hu isn't someone
who can work under someone.

190
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,179
If you tie him up against his will,
and he'll get hurt. So...

191
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,100
Your problem is that
you exaggerate too much.

192
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,145
Jeong-hu has struck gold.

193
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,067
Boss will cover up all the crimes
Jeong-hu has committed.

194
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,737
And if Boss likes him,

195
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:02,367
using his abilities, he can have anything
he has ever dreamed of.

196
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,121
-Like you?
-That would be a huge success.

197
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,707
By betraying your friends...

198
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,543
and driving them to their deaths?

199
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,883
You heard Jun-seok's statement.

200
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,177
I didn't kill them.

201
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,929
You made their deaths be in vain.

202
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,681
You made your little brother

203
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,476
lie too.

204
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,733
Enough already. Aren't you sick of it?

205
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,078
I still have that dream...

206
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,331
of me that day

207
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,209
talking to the detectives.

208
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,006
"Gil-han and Jun-seok fought often...

209
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,177
about money."

210
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,890
Go home. I'm tired and I need to rest.

211
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,603
What about Ji-an?

212
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,189
What did you do that poor girl?

213
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,817
How could you say she was dead
when she was alive?

214
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,700
Name, Ahn Sang-hyeon. Age, 39.

215
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,120
He looked familiar,
so it kept bothering me.

216
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:14,666
I remember meeting him
on my last case as a detective.

217
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,504
He's a manager of
Jeil's Special Investigation Team.

218
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,425
That investigation team
seems very suspicious.

219
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:29,014
Those guys you took photos of recently
all work under him.

220
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,477
If his guys attacked us at the church,

221
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,645
one of them killed Park Dong-cheol.

222
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,734
He's been working
in Sang-su's office recently.

223
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,195
He has a few people that tag along
with him.

224
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,363
I don't know where the rest are.

225
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,293
He went there at least
every other day for a month.

226
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,130
He either has a mistress there

227
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:47,384
or that's where
the investigation team punks are.

228
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,472
Okay, let's see if
Mr. Ahn's mistress lives here,

229
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,975
or if it's just his little punks.

230
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,790
Jeong-hu has begun to fight.

231
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,127
He wants to find the murderer himself

232
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:08,298
and escape from that Boss' grasp.

233
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,802
If they find out about Jeong-hu,
they won't sit still.

234
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,514
We need to be quick
before they figure it out.

235
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,603
And this is a message from Jeong-hu,
who disconnected his phone.

236
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,733
"Sir, please drive Yeong-sin
to and from work.

237
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,361
It won't take long." That's all.

238
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,864
With that, our call ends too.

239
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,536
Come in.

240
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,376
These are the interviews
on the minium case.

241
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,962
I emailed you the file.

242
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,346
Jeong-hu is doing well.

243
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,561
He's fighting well and he's healthy.

244
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,355
I see.

245
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,236
That's a relief. Thank you.

246
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,449
Right...

247
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:21,788
Have you decided on leading Jeil News?

248
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,582
Should I go? Should I quit Someday?

249
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,962
Well, the title is the same,
but it's not comparable.

250
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,672
That's a huge broadcast station.

251
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,007
It is.

252
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,050
It's a national network.

253
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,137
I'm sure they'll pay you much more.

254
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,098
They may give you a car
with a driver too, right?

255
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,060
Honestly, I'm torn. Maybe I'll take
everyone at Someday with me.

256
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,021
Oh, wow.

257
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,692
And lift the suspension
on Chief Jang's wife's chicken place.

258
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,153
What do you think?

259
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,824
-I have a question.
-What is it?

260
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:05,165
If we go there, can we continue with
the broadcasts that we're preparing?

261
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,585
The follow-up of our fathers' stories
in 1992.

262
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,045
Probably not.

263
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,840
Then can you go after finishing this one?

264
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,801
I made a promise to Jeong-hu

265
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,473
to finish our fathers' investigation
for the both of us.

266
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,935
-And...
-And?

267
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:31,274
If we do this broadcast,
maybe that Boss, the insane old man,

268
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:36,571
might begin to fear us a little bit.

269
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,240
I would like him to fear us a little.

270
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,328
They locked you up and almost killed you.

271
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,413
Aren't you afraid of them?

272
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,831
Of course I am.

273
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,667
But those people

274
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,212
are like zombies.

275
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,215
So we have to fight them.
If we just stay still,

276
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,468
they might bite us and
we may become zombies too.

277
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,726
This broadcast won't be that entertaining.

278
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,853
It's old, so we have no photos or videos.

279
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,688
We only have a few interviews.

280
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,192
But if Boss watches it,
he wouldn't feel comfortable.

281
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,694
The subject of this broadcast is this.

282
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:21,408
How did Boss make his fortune?

283
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,368
First on the list.

284
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,870
The 1992 minium case.

285
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,083
I think Kim Mun-ho
decided to stay at Someday.

286
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,172
He is inflexible and so single-minded.

287
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,426
Seo Jeong-hu has gone missing.

288
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,178
So, he chose to run away?

289
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,516
What should I instruct Manager Ahn?

290
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,686
Wait another day,
and if we don't hear from him,

291
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,647
tell him to send
the confession tape to the police.

292
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,567
Yes, sir.

293
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:01,114
It's rare for Boss
to show interest in someone.

294
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,033
What a waste.

295
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,353
I am so sorry.

296
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,262
Gosh, thank you.

297
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,597
Thank you.

298
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,604
It isn't difficult
getting their fingerprints,

299
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,566
but you said their fingerprints
aren't in the police database.

300
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,776
I know.

301
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,695
The prints must be on the evidence.

302
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,030
I don't like this.

303
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,784
You said that the guy who hit
Park Dong-cheol with the pipe

304
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,910
wasn't wearing gloves?

305
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,329
He held the pipe with his bare hands.

306
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,914
I never miss things like that.

307
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,999
But you missed his face?

308
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,461
I was busy looking at Park Dong-cheol.

309
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,799
-Send me the prints. I'll take care of it.
-Okay.

310
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,261
But where do you sleep at night?

311
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,222
I heard you don't go to the apartment.

312
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,853
I'm going through a phase.
I think too much when I'm alone,

313
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,939
so I prefer places where people are loud.

314

320
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,276
Wow, that looks delicious.

321
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,571
This is why I work out in the morning.

322
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,366
It's so that I can enjoy
your food even more.

323
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,662
You always enjoyed my cooking.

324
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,288
Thank you.

325
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,501
I can't begin to thank you
for taking care of me

326
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,087
for the past 20 years,

327
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,216
and for your unfailing love for me.

328
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,390
I told you when I agreed to marry you

329
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:42,145
that I could never be your woman.

330
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,981
You said it was okay,

331
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,067
as long as I stayed by your side.

332
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,445
Thank you for that.

333
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,031
I didn't

334
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,492
belong anywhere in this world back then.

335
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,162
Thank you for giving me a place.

336
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,500
Myeong-hui.

337
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,628
What's wrong?

338
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,130
Mun-ho will be here soon.

339
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,133
I'm going to stay with him for a while.

340
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,097
Did I...

341
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,850
Did I do something wrong?

342
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,145
Just tell me.

343
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,606
I just have something to do.

344
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,109
Tell me. I'll do it for you.

345
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,322
I think my daughter, Ji-an...

346
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,950
I think she is alive. I need to find her.

347
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,662
I'll help you.

348
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,209
I'll do whatever it takes to find her.

349
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,168
I want to...

350
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,922
do it myself.

351
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,507
I'm sorry.

352
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,010
I just can't trust you.

353
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,179
No.

354
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,224
You do trust me.

355
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,561
You're the only one in the world
who trusts me.

356
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,481
Why did you say Ji-an died...

357
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,401
when she was alive?

358
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:15,947
She died.

359
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,285
They all said she died.

360
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,293
I get it now.

361
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,464
All those years...

362
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,468
I tried so hard.

363
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:38,970
But...

364
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,643
now I know why I couldn't love you.

365
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,437
It's all clear now.

366
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,444
I can explain everything.

367
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,909
You'll understand
when you hear me out, so...

368
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,999
I loaded your stuff in the car.
Do you want to finish eating?

369
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,502
No.

370
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,422
Let's go now.

371
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,768
Myeong-hui.

372
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,285
Goodbye.

373
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,530
-Slow down.
-Read faster.

374
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,658
-Wait a minute.
-Still have one more page.

375
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,575
You can...

376
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,082
Let me introduce one of the five members
of the 1980 pirate radio broadcast,

377
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,583
Choi Myeong-hui.

378
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,131
This is the editor-in-chief,
Chief Jang Byeong-se.

379
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,676
Hello, I'm Chief Jang Byeong-se.

380
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,595
This is our ever-talented Reporter Yeo.

381
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,472
Hello!

382
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,143
-Lee Jong-su.
-Hello, I'm Lee Jong-su.

383
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,436
Chan-yeong and Seon-jae.

384
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:56,565
-Hello.
-Hello. I've always wanted to meet you.

385
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,985
And this is Yeong-sin.

386
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,575
-Choi Myeong-hui!
-Choi Myeong-hui!

387
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,871
-Choi Myeong-hui!
-Choi Myeong-hui!

388
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,044
-Just speak into this.
-Thank you.

389
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,716
Here, have some coffee.
It's freshly brewed.

390
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:26,512
We could've come to see you.
You didn't have to come all the way here.

391
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,180
I begged Mun-ho to bring me here.

392
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,558
I'm a huge fan of Someday News.

393
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,478
We don't have any regular fans.
They are all huge fans.

394
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,188
-Right?
-Yes.

395
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,316
-Hey, Chan-yeong.
-Yes?

396
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,486
Isn't it a bit dim?
Get some lights and reflectors.

397
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,031
-Get moving, quickly. Just a minute.
-Yes, sir.

398
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,163
These are the interview questions.

399
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,874
Look them over and tell me
if you want any changes.

400
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,086
-He isn't here?
-Pardon?

401
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,256
Your boyfriend.
I thought he worked with you.

402
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,674
Right.

403
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,052
We can't meet right now.

404
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,219
Why not?

405
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,275
He's fighting with Boss right now.

406
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,652
One of the farmers from the broadcast?

407
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,490
Yes. That mad old man
took a liking to my boyfriend.

408
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:31,243
And he wants my boyfriend to work for him,
and he threatened him.

409
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,580
So, my man is furious right now
and fighting him.

410
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,124
Fighting? You don't mean fist-fighting?

411
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,464
Well, you see, they always start it first.

412
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,509
So, what? Should we just
let them beat us up?

413
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,637
Then they'll go,
"They're just taking it," and hit more.

414
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,555
That's how they are.

415
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,226
So, you have to attack the enemy first.
You've got to keep on taking jabs.

416
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,692
-What is it?
-He says he wants our fingerprints.

417
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:07,446
It takes so long to get one at a time,
and it's boring.

418
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,575
Plus, it's past lunchtime,
so I'm hungry. So...

419
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,036
One, two, three, four, and five.

420
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,746
I would rather do it all at once.

421
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,997
What is he babbling about?

422
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,928
He didn't run away.

423
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,849
Seo Jeong-hu obtained all
of our guys' fingerprints.

424
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,854
In my personal opinion,
he will be difficult to tame.

425
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,566
I recommend having him
locked up and isolated.

426
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,110
And another thing.

427
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,655
I think Healer's hacker took my bait.

428
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,241
We don't need the hacker anyway.

429
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,912
So, I think we can just get rid of her.

430
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,345
Yeong-sin.

431
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,976
Yeong-sin, what are you doing?

432
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,154
PARK BONG-SU

433
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,823
PARK BONG-SU

434
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:04,456
The number is not in service.
Please check the number and try again.

435
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,503
Jeong-hu, what are you doing?

436
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,632
-Who wants some coffee?
-Me.

437
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,219
Mom came to Someday and did an interview.

438
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,971
We all ate late night snack together too.

439
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,601
I need to introduce you to her.
When can I do that?

440
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,315
Actually, I guess I should
introduce myself first, right?

441
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,896
Yeong-sin, I'm a bit confused.

442
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:10,564
I mean,

443
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,859
fighting isn't a problem for me at all.

444
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,321
The more I fight, the more I can learn

445
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,657
about how to win.

446
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,867
But Yeong-sin...

447
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,497
I'm not sure who I am fighting

448
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,874
right now.

449
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,070
Hello, I'm Kim Mun-ho of Someday News.

450
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,448
The minium case in 1992
resulted in the death

451
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,158
of Oh Gil-han and Seo Jun-seok,

452
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:08,664
two of the five friends who did
the pirate radio broadcasts in 1980.

453
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,749
That minium case is quite simple.

454
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,253
Someone made a fake coating.

455
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,132
Instead of preventing steel
from corroding as intended,

456
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,676
the fake coating accelerated corrosion.

457
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:27,433
This was first used on a bridge
that was being constructed at the time.

458
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:32,396
I worked on Seodo Bridge in 1992.

459
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:33,772
You know it, right?

460
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,442
It collapsed before it even opened.

461
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,154
The construction company
that built that bridge

462
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,114
almost went bankrupt
and was bought cheaply

463
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,283
by another construction company.

464
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,244
The acquiring company's
largest shareholder

465
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,413
was Omega Investments,
a venture capital firm.

466
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:55,002
We were investigating
a venture capital firm, Omega Investments.

467
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,212
Perfectly fine companies

468
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,716
would almost go bankrupt
because of a strange accident or rumor.

469
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:04,178
And without fail, a company
affiliated with Omega Investments

470
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,262
would acquire them.

471
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,934
Companies and investment firms
may make money.

472
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:15,856
But it isn't right to use people's lives
to make money.

473
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,318
The venture capital firm,
Omega Investments,

474
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:23,113
still exists today
under the name Omega Holdings.

475
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:28,494
We at Someday News contacted people there
for an interview,

476
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,162
but they have not responded.

477
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:35,334
We also introduced the current CEO
of Omega Holdings recently.

478
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:43,300
Our reporter requested for an interview,
but he refused.

479
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:48,639
Will you please do an interview with us
at Someday News,

480
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,974
Mr. Park Jeong-dae?

481
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,151
What on earth is this?

482
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,913
Did I leave this open?

483
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:14,790
What is this?

484
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,625
Oh, my gosh.

485
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,920
It's been a while, Yoon Dong-won.

486
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:20,837
What?

487
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,091
Detective Jo Min-ja!

488
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,719
Do you remember this punk?

489
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,599
Detective Jo, let's not do this.
Let's meet in person.

490
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,394
I really miss you.

491
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,646
You're still single, aren't you?

492
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,400
What, have you been keeping tabs on me?

493
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:46,613
Get over me
and meet another woman already.

494
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,991
So, do you remember him?

495
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,913
You're still lacking brain cells.

496
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,833
Remember our last case?

497
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,294
The Omega Holdings' money laundering case
in 2000.

498
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,506
Remember the place we raided?

499
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,467
We saw a young hacker there, remember?

500
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,721
That little kid was a genius.

501
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,931
Right! Yes.

502
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,059
See that envelope next to you?

503
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,655
Those are the fingerprints of the boys
that work for him.

504
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:33,577
One of them probably killed a man
with a steel pipe to the back of the head.

505
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,662
The victim was Park Dong-cheol.

506
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,791
We already have a sketch of the suspect.

507
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,126
He's being framed.

508
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,130
So, use the fingerprints
to find the real killer.

509
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:51,053
Come on, you should ask favors
like this in person.

510
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,138
-Yoon Dong-won.
-Yes, ma'am?

511
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,643
In 2000, if we had locked them up
like we should have,

512
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:01,772
we would have saved
at least four people today.

513
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,611
KO SEONG-CHEOL

514
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,738
HWANG JAE-GUK

515
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,823
KI YEONG-JAE

516
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,201
PARK DONG-CHEOL

517
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,625
It might have been better
if we had more power as the police.

518
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,170
Is that why you left
without saying goodbye?

519
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,339
You were mad that we were powerless?

520
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,550
The murder weapon, a steel pipe,
must be in the evidence room.

521
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,344
Check the fingerprints on it.

522
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,764
-For ten years--
-I'm checking the black boxes

523
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:39,101
from cars at the scene,
so I'll send you anything useful.

524
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,605
And if you need to reach me,
I left you a phone.

525
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,857
Wait! You're Healer's...

526
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:49,653
You're Healer's partner, right?
Jo Min-ja! Damn.

527
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,579
JO

528
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,106
Yoon Dong-won took the fingerprints,
so wait a little while.

529
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,191
That's why I'm waiting.

530
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,697
Let me tell you a method that I prefer.

531
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,286
Finding the file that contains
my fake confession and deleting it neatly.

532
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,913
First, I need to search this headquarter.

533
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,917
Next is finding everyone
who may have a copy.

534
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,592
Don't tell me you plan to barge
into enemy territory like a stupid mutt.

535
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:59,139
That's why I'm just glaring at them
for now. Patiently.

536
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,170
The card has been activated.

537
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,053
I'll trace the IP address
and get the address.

538
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,971
-Get ready to go.
-Yes, sir.

539
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,725
Something must be going on.

540
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,478
How many men can you send?

541
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,983
That depends on how much you can pay.

542
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,362
We have begun tracking
Healer's hacker partner.

543
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,032
Get everyone you can.

544
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:03,161
His partner? So, Healer had a partner.

545
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,329
I knew it.

546
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,290
One guy can't do all of that.

547
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,251
He must have a partner, subordinates,

548
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,212
and at least a small army.

549
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,173
Why that...

550
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,009
-Emergency team, come with me!
-Yes, sir.

551
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,981
Well, look at this.

552
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,026
The thrill of hunting is the chase,
isn't it?

553
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,739
They are emptying out for me.
Ms. Jo, I'm going in.

554
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,912
Roll it and press it well

555
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,793
Ms. Jo. I said I'm going in.

556
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,336
I heard you.

557
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,846
Ms. Jo, it's connected.

558
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,099
There are so many computers.

559
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,559
It will take forever to search them all.

560
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:37,607
It's so bright and shiny.
Is your place like this too?

561
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,278
Excuse me.

562
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,698
But where is that?

563
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,034
I saw everyone run out.

564
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,917
I'll hit you if you don't spill it.
And it will hurt.

565
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,462
Where is it?

566
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,257
-Healer...
-What?

567
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:06,553
The Healer's hacker.

568
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:13,476
Hey, Ms. Jo. Is your address 23-1?

569
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,479
How did you know?

570
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,636
-This way.
-Hurry!

571
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,915
Move, miss!

572
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,469
Hey, miss!

573
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,222
Damn it.

574
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,476
Hey! This way! Hurry!

575
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,853
Stop right there!

576
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,414
What on earth?

577
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,668
-Is that you, Ms. Jo?
-You mutt.

578
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,214
What on earth are you wearing?

579
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,549
Ms. Jo!

580
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,947
Look at me again,
and I'll pull out all of your hair.

581
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:17,035
Okay. I get it. Fine. You're so mean.

582
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,754
Where do you live? I'll drive you.

583
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,134
I left behind all the black box
memory cards you took.

584
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,470
I got everything else, but...

585
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,972
-Hey, Ms. Jo.
-I'm sorry.

586
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,390
I think I get it now.

587
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,727
-What?
-Who I need to fight.

588
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,938
What the hell are you talking about?

589
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:49,359
It wasn't fun sneaking around
getting those runts' fingerprints.

590
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,028
So, I'm thinking...

591
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,949
Do you want to do something fun with me?

592
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,910
You know I don't do anything
that doesn't pay.

593
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:02,330
Well, I don't think it will pay.

594
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,874
-Forget it.
-Come on, it will be super fun.

595
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:08,461
You know how hard it is for people like us
to find something fun to do.

596
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,298
Look at me.

597
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,175
I'm Healer.

598
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,803
Trust me, okay?

599
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:48,102
"What was the most difficult job
you ever did?"

600
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:52,440
It was finding some girl.

601
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,525
I need to tell you something.

602
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,402
I'll tell you tonight.

603
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:57,945
Remember Ko Seong-cheol?

604
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,573
This is a copy of the video he brought.

605
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,201
Once you have secured it, kill her.

606
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,535
Kill her?

607
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,329
This is very dangerous.

608
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,538
Let's think this over.

609
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,124
Is that a habit?
Just thinking all the time.

610
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,710
If you can't stop this,
you're absolutely done.

611
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,045
Stop!
