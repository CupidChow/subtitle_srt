1
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,025
This is so awkward.

2
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,535
Question number

3
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,788
one.

4
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,335
Yes, I'm Healer.

5
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,170
My real name is irrelevant.

6
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,255
Number two.

7
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,799
What do I do?

8
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,928
I'm a man for hire.

9
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,223
I have the best skills in the business.

10
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,433
Number three.

11
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,478
Was this my dream career?

12
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,606
What kind of a question is that?

13
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,443
I was

14
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,196
only going to do this

15
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,699
until I could buy a deserted island
in the South Pacific.

16
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,577
There's one I have my eyes on.

17
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,665
From what I gather,
it's still available for purchase.

18
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,418
Anyway, that was the plan.

19
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,423
But then I met

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:14,926
this girl.

21
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,557
My world started spinning.

22
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,562
So my dream changed which
also honored my master's dying wish.

23
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,567
I decided to

24
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,071
live an ordinary life
with the girl I love.

25
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,741
I thought it'd be easy,

26
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,288
but they just wouldn't leave me alone.

27
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,458
They kept throwing jabs and kicked me.

28
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,712
But what upset me the most...

29
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,343
was that they messed with my people.

30
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,385
Let's go.

31
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,354
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

32
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,155
I can stay for some coffee.

33
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,867
-I'll see you tomorrow. Drive safely.
-Okay.

34
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,494
-Bye.
-Bye.

35
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,585
Why did they close so early?

36
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,171
Dad?

37
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,805
You're finally home. We've been waiting.

38
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,520
Jeong-hu.

39
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,189
Look before swinging.

40
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,899
Close your eyes.

41
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,781
Hello.

42
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,414
My name is Seo Jeong-hu.

43
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,583
I couldn't tell you my real name before

44
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,879
because of some circumstances.

45
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,966
Yeong-sin.

46
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,093
Are you okay with your eyes opened?

47
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,845
I won't look.

48
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,022
Thugs like them might return.

49
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,236
-Yeong-sin.
-My eyes are closed.

50
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,657
-Are you done?
-Yes.

51
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,793
I'm sorry,

52
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,588
but I need to tell you

53
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,508
some sensitive stuff
that they shouldn't hear.

54
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,096
Anyway, please call the police.

55
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,806
Yes, I will!

56
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,767
Tell them they tried to rob you,

57
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,311
but don't mention me.

58
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,104
No, I won't!

59
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,156
Wait.

60
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,159
So, your name is not Bong-su?

61
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,827
No, it's not.

62
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,664
Is Yeong-sin in danger too?

63
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,835
For now, yes.

64
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,338
Explain what's going on.

65
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,802
My father, my master, and Yeong-sin's dad

66
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,099
all died because of some people.

67
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,270
And so...

68
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,189
Well, that is...

69
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,317
You see, what happened was...

70
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,822
Dad, our fathers were reporters,

71
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,407
and they died while uncovering
a corruption case.

72
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,325
That's right.

73
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,538
-But no one would punish these bastards.
-No one.

74
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,874
That's why he's been doing this until now.

75
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,793
-From then until now.
-Right.

76
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,045
That's why he's fighting them,
to tell them to stop.

77
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:01,963
Exactly.

78
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,923
And now they're playing dirty.

79
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,385
They sent men to hurt me
just to threaten Jeong-hu.

80
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:08,928
That's it.

81
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,933
So, what's this about
murder and reporters?

82
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,895
Given all of that,
I need to take Yeong-sin with me.

83
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,481
What the hell are they saying?

84
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,609
As you can see,
this place is too dangerous.

85
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,529
We have a few safe houses.

86
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,822
-You--
-Chi-su, don't.

87
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,408
I won't allow it.

88
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,494
I can't send my daughter with a guy

89
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,662
who keeps changing his name.

90
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,080
Not a chance.

91
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,666
He says he can't do it.

92
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,211
Okay, got it.

93
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,716
We'll look into renting or buying
the place next door.

94
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,886
We'll declare this a safe house for now.
I'll be back.

95
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,306
Wait... Hey.

96
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,395
Just five seconds.

97
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,238
That's better.

98
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,743
-Come back soon.
-I will.

99
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,964
Eat well

100
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,925
and listen to your father.

101
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,844
Enjoy...

102
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,431
your meals, sir.

103
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,021
Isn't he funny?

104
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,235
How are there so many homes?

105
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,030
There must be people
living in all of them.

106
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,741
The nurse will be here soon.

107
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,493
Call me if you need anything.

108
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,410
Okay.

109
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,706
Myeong-hui.

110
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,337
Let's have dinner together.

111
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,007
I'll cook. You do the dishes.

112
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,720
I need to tell you something.

113
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,765
I'll tell you tonight.

114
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,017
I will.

115
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,397
I'll be waiting.

116
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,774
See you later.

117
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:56,929
Democracy, democracy, where are you?

118
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,684
Here I am

119
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,440
Kim Mun-ho speaking.

120
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,027
If you have a tip,
you should call Someday...

121
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,322
You're where?

122
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,510
I'm Kim Mun-ho.

123
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,679
Are you the one who just called?

124
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,599
You said you have a tip about Boss.

125
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,602
How do you know him?

126
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,189
Miss? Please look at me.

127
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,442
HELP ME

128
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,073
Miss?

129
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,784
Are you okay? Miss!

130
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,947
Jeong-hu's friend!

131
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,085
It's as if you threw
the concept of caution out the window.

132
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,089
Don't you know that
it's easier to kill people like you

133
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,216
by ruining your reputation?

134
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,468
Are you Jeong-hu's--

135
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,430
"Reporter Kim Mun-ho did
this and that with a minor."

136
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,850
With a picture on top of that,
you're done for.

137
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,685
Even if the truth is revealed later,

138
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,395
it won't matter.

139
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,564
You're right.

140
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,941
Remember Ko Seong-cheol?

141
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,069
The man from L.A. who was murdered?

142
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,530
This is a copy of the video he brought.

143
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,199
How did you--

144
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,911
If you saw everything I had on my clients,

145
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,164
you'd probably faint.

146
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:33,043
Anyway, it's better if you stay away
from Someday News for the time being.

147
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,714
SHUT DOWN THE LIE-SPREADING SOMEDAY NEWS!

148
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,844
There are people saying you beat them up
and landed them in the hospital.

149
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,513
NEWSPAPER THAT SPREADS LIES!
IT'S DIVIDING THE NATION!

150
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,848
Who put this here?

151
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,433
-Who is this?
-Hey.

152
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,603
Everyone! Kim Mun-ho is a liar!

153
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:55,441
-Repent!
-Repent!

154
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,360
-Repent!
-Repent!

155
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:05,326
-Repent!
-Repent!

156
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,911
-Repent!
-Repent!

157
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,912
Hurry.

158
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,833
-Do you work at Someday News?
-Yes.

159
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,502
Close it!

160
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,381
Can you believe it?
These old people are rapping.

161
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,175
Gosh, those people...

162
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,718
What are you doing?

163
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,178
Well...

164
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,185
What are you doing?
Are you a thief or what?

165
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,106
Well, I needed something.

166
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,408
This is the recording they wanted.
It's the tip from Russia.

167
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,048
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

168
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,970
I'll start the recording.
I'm Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

169
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,806
May I get your name?

170
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,559
I'm calling from Russia.

171
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,103
I would like to speak
with Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

172
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,896
I can't trust anyone else.

173
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,775
He isn't in right now.

174
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,485
If you could tell me...

175
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,654
My name is Kim Jae-yun.

176
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,408
I'm a researcher
working under Doctor Nicholai Kogiriv.

177
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,826
I...

178
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,162
This is where it ends.

179
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,039
They heard this much as well.

180
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,835
But is this enough?

181
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,423
Okay, then I'll clear out.

182
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,510
Wait, how did you get in here?
I've been standing here the whole time.

183
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,805
I blinked once and voila,
he was standing there.

184
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,809
Bong-su, you seem very different today.

185
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,935
It's his outfit.

186
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,313
No, it's his face. What could it be?

187
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,317
-I'll deliver this.
-Wait, that...

188
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,784
Hey, Bong-su...

189
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,161
This shampoo is so awesome!

190
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,999
Wash your hair at home, please.

191
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,629
What is he doing?

192
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,674
It felt like a goodbye.

193
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,135
If you want to say goodbye,
you should go out the door!

194
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,262
There's no exit over there!

195
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,890
Question.

196
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,726
"People you remember from past jobs."

197
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,062
I don't usually remember names.

198
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,565
My partner sends me those I need,

199
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,775
and I delete it once I'm done.

200
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,197
My work is actually very simple.

201
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,243
Get a job request, and get it done.

202
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,247
I then come home and open a can of beer.

203
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,457
The end.

204
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,421
So, I have no stories to tell you.

205
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:14,306
"What was the most difficult job
you ever did?"

206
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,191
It was finding

207
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,860
some girl.

208
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,698
I first met her on the bus.

209
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,536
I don't remember how she looked then
since I wasn't interested.

210
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,746
But this girl

211
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,833
actually came after me.

212
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,752
She was fearless.

213
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,050
Keep it down.

214
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,553
Hey...

215
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,762
Hush.

216
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,681
It hurts.

217
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,934
Right from the beginning,

218
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,854
I hurt her though.

219
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,442
She can't breathe
at any remote sign of violence,

220
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,445
but I didn't know that.

221
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,075
Thinking back,

222
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,955
her life became so complicated
after she met me.

223
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,876
She constantly got hurt.

224
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,962
She almost...

225
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,090
lost her life too.

226
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,802
She naturally smiles a lot.

227
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,556
Don't forget...

228
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,019
that you're one to always smile a lot.

229
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,030
So what's the next question?

230
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,373
Is this that infamous L.A. video?

231
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,043
Many have died because of it.

232
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,504
The freelancer reporter
who took the video died.

233
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,466
Ko Seong-cheol, who stole it
and tried to sell it in Korea, died.

234
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,470
Then, Hwang Jae-guk got killed
to cover up Ko Seong-cheol's death.

235
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,486
Why isn't Jeong-hu here yet?
It's dark out already.

236
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,904
He can't come yet.

237
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,406
-Why not?
-He's waiting.

238
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,617
-For what?
-Good news.

239
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,334
Let's forget

240
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,839
Little by little

241
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,175
The night

242
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,381
What happened?

243
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,009
I went to the evidence room.

244
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,760
Spit it out.

245
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,391
The steel pipe used to kill
Park Dong-cheol had no prints on it.

246
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,227
They must have dusted it
for prints already.

247
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,687
There is no such record.

248
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,149
The pipe is clean.
There wasn't a drop of blood.

249
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,819
Then what about the fingerprints
we sent you?

250
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,071
I need something to compare them to.

251
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,911
Hang on.

252
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,330
I got a ping.

253
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,415
You see, I ran a search.

254
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,499
Here it is.

255
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,086
Seocho Precinct received a file
15 minutes ago.

256
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,464
A video confession
of Park Dong-cheol's murder.

257
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,176
My name is Seo Jeong-hu.

258
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:25,557
I am the one who killed Park Dong-cheol
behind the St. Mary's Church...

259
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,517
on January 27.

260
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,145
We were fighting about his gambling debt,

261
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,856
and I grabbed a pipe
and struck him in the head.

262
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,902
Min-ja, can you please tell me now?

263
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,821
What is your relationship
with this Seo Jeong-hu?

264
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,616
We are citizens of the same country.

265
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,710
Did you hear that?

266
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,379
Loud and clear.

267
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,423
What happens now?

268
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,593
If a suspect confesses
but doesn't turn himself in,

269
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,929
they will put out a nationwide lookout

270
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,057
with your face blown up in full HD.

271
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,852
I knew things were going too smoothly.

272
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,312
It's time for Plan B.

273
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,398
-What's Plan B?
-Well...

274
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,942
I'm still thinking.

275
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,696
-Jeong-hu.
-Yes?

276
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,532
Yeong-sin is standing in front of me.

277
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,159
She heard everything.

278
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,339
-Jeong-hu.
-Yes?

279
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,384
Let's catch that crazy old geezer

280
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,720
before you get caught.

281
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,762
That'll solve everything.

282
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,015
Okay.

283
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,766
If...

284
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,856
If catching that old geezer isn't enough,

285
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,776
let's run away together.

286
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,611
That's dumb of you.

287
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,364
What about your dad and mom?

288
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,367
Dad will understand.

289
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,286
And my mom...

290
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,498
It's okay since she doesn't know about me.

291
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,294
There are plenty of places in this world

292
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,547
where no one will find us.

293
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,758
Don't worry. I'll look into it.

294
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,764
Jeong-hu, are you listening?

295
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,851
Jeong-hu?

296
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,193
What man would make his woman a fugitive?

297
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,528
Yeong-sin...

298
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,948
You're just so utterly clueless.

299
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,254
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

300
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,097
We have a guest.

301
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,137
She made all this food.

302
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,174
Are you Yeong-sin's father?

303
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,302
Yes, hello. I'm Chae Chi-su.

304
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,347
I'm sorry.

305
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,101
The child in the picture is so pretty.

306
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:43,481
Yes, Yeong-sin has always been so.

307
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,653
How did you raise your daughter

308
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,157
to be so cheerful and warm?

309
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:56,828
Well, others are often surprised too.

310
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,973
This is her from when she was young.

311
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,811
They grow up so quickly.

312
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,606
Take a look.

313
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,237
That's before we renovated the cafe.

314
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,632
I thought

315
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,929
that maybe my birth mom knows.

316
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,140
I must take after her.

317
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,106
You know I can't talk when I'm scared.

318
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,191
I laugh instead.

319
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,280
You on the other hand
keep to yourself when you're afraid.

320
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,075
Is it because you don't want
others to see you?

321
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,120
Jeong-hu.

322
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,457
What are you up to all alone?

323
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,170
TO SOMEDAY NEWS

324
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,573
TO KIM MUN-HO

325
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,158
TO KIM MUN-HO

326
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,225
Hey, punk.

327
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,187
You know nothing yet.

328
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,565
How long ago did you learn about love?

329
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,360
About ten years?

330
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,445
That's not nearly enough.

331
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,072
Look at me.

332
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:41,493
It's been past 20 years,
and nearing 30 years.

333
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,954
That's when you can say you know love.

334
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,624
Who measures love by time?

335
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,001
Even if it's only for a day,

336
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,463
what matters is the depth and sincerity.

337
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,885
You were always such a talker.

338
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,096
It was annoying as hell.

339
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,067
Jun-seok's son is here.

340
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,736
Come on. Have a seat.

341
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,536
Jeong-hu.

342
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,790
You know Uncle Mun-sik, don't you?

343
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,213
You're Kim Mun-sik.

344
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:39,884
You're too young
to be confused with names.

345
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,388
I'm Oh Gil-han.

346
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,808
He is Uncle Kim Mun-sik.

347
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,685
He looks like Jun-seok.

348
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,355
That's why I felt bad from the start.

349
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,606
What's the point

350
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,151
in just looking like him though?

351
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,694
Lower your expectations.

352
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:02,365
Kids these days don't have
the spirit and passion

353
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,492
that we used to have.

354
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,202
Exactly.

355
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:12,208
It's impossible to be like us
when there is too much of everything.

356
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,209
Right.

357
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:14,794
Right!

358
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,799
Let's drink.

359
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,430
How long has he been like this?

360
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,682
He isn't like this all day long.

361
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,727
It's only after having
a few drinks at night.

362
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,538
I wanted to ask that man in there
for a favor,

363
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,208
but I have no choice.

364
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,005
This is your phone
that I confiscated before.

365
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:04,052
There are many interesting
phone numbers in here.

366
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,563
I need to see Boss.

367
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,983
He isn't someone you can see
whenever you want.

368
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,779
I got a package from Russia.

369
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,824
Give him a call.

370
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,868
He's been very interested
in this country lately.

371
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,978
Hey.

372
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,273
The old man is waiting for this.

373
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,766
Why are you so angry?

374
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,520
I just get worked up every time I see him.

375
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,398
He killed my master,

376
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,692
but is still living his life.

377
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,444
Isn't that right?

378
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,702
Where's the content of the package?

379
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,913
If I bring it,

380
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,748
will you stop the manhunt

381
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,751
and delete the video you gave the police?

382
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,210
Bring me the item first.

383
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,426
What was in the package?

384
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,015
Just this phone.

385
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,183
What's in it?

386
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,559
One video file.

387
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,230
It's of people in some town
collapsing and throwing up.

388
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,357
Kid,

389
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,151
do you still not get it?

390
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:30,323
If you're with me, no one can touch you
even if you're a murderer.

391
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,660
It will all be okay.

392
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,128
Honestly,

393
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,547
I'm tired.

394
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,592
I don't expect much in life.

395
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,804
I just want to live comfortably
with my girlfriend.

396
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,812
Being chased by the police
and threatened by you

397
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,147
I can handle,

398
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:08,027
but I can't stand my girlfriend
going through that.

399
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,445
Then first,

400
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,074
where's the item the woman sent?

401
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,964
It's a video of Dugok-ri.

402
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,216
It's authentic.

403
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,971
Did she try to send this to Kim Mun-ho?

404
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,764
But,

405
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:42,145
you snatched it before it could reach him.

406
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,526
Good boy.

407
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,438
Reporter Kim Mun-ho,
are you watching this?

408
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,318
I have something to tell you.

409
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,663
Miss, can you spare me some time?

410
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,126
I told you not to do that.

411
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,669
How about an evening drive?

412
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,214
-Where to?
-Anywhere you want.

413
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:13,361
When I hold his hand,
I feel like he's saying, "It's okay."

414
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,115
The warmth spreads
throughout my entire body.

415
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,744
The one and only
incredible hand in the world that says,

416
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,331
"It's okay now."

417
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,878
Question.

418
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,839
Things I like.

419
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,676
High places, first snow,

420
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,429
small hands, white blankets,

421
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,640
and her hair.

422
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,934
Things I dislike.

423
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,605
All that keeps me away from those things.

424
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,954
Stop that already!

425
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,582
-Sorry?
-Jeez.

426
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:09,959
Look.

427
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,672
I'm so used to being alone
that if someone breathes next to me,

428
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:19,260
my hair shoots up and I go crazy.

429
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,431
If someone big like you
keeps rolling that thing, I--

430
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,563
INTERNATIONAL CALL

431
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,148
Hello. Kim Mun-ho speaking.

432
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,026
Are you Reporter Kim Mun-ho?

433
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,864
Can you recognize my voice?
Are you Kim Jae-yun?

434
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,366
Yes. I'm Kim Jae-yun.

435
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,746
I'm in Dalian, China,
but I'll be in Korea soon.

436
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,207
May we meet at the airport?

437
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,792
I'm going to leave right after we meet.

438
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,628
I don't have a Korean visa.

439
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:58,466
Hello. Ms. Kim?

440
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,635
The video was

441
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,138
sent by Kim Jae-yun,
a Korean-Chinese biochemist.

442
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:09,477
The research team used our massive funding
to cultivate new bacteria,

443
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,439
but Kim Jae-yun destroyed them all.

444
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,399
She kept a small sample though,

445
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,736
and she's bringing that to Korea.

446
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,073
It's a call from China.

447
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,995
So this is what you look like.

448
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,960
To think of the times
you made a fool out of me...

449
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,386
That's some great teamwork.

450
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,522
She's coming to Korea today.

451
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,940
She bought a ticket.

452
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,819
-We'll go get her.
-You don't have to bring the woman.

453
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,782
Just secure the bacteria.

454
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,623
The general meeting was scheduled.

455
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,087
The topic of discussion
is the renewal of your term,

456
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,630
CEO Park.

457
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,969
Please attend and explain everything
that is going on.

458
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,389
Who is using this time to make a move?

459
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,808
Are they planning a coup or something?

460
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,185
It isn't a rebellion.

461
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,813
You didn't just expose your identity,

462
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,607
but almost exposed us as well.

463
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,827
Aren't you switching sides too quickly?

464
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,746
I'll see you at the meeting.

465
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,006
A Chinese national is
coming to Korea without a visa.

466
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:06,510
One airport permits people
to enter Korea from China without a visa

467
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,762
for 120 hours.

468
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,224
There is one flight from Dalian
to that airport today.

469
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,560
We just have to go and meet her.

470
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,188
Do you want to do the interview?

471
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,564
Really?

472
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,776
Life is all sugar and rainbows for you,
isn't it?

473
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:27,531
Look, the mad old geezer is
sending an army.

474
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,118
Even Healer can't handle such odds.

475
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,870
What should we do then?

476
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,290
We'll broadcast live.

477
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,501
It holds a lot of power.

478
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,547
Most people don't commit a crime
in the middle of a broadcast.

479
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,425
Unbelievable.

480
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,512
What the hell am I doing with you two?

481
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,764
Darn it.

482
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,227
Yoon Dong-won speaking.

483
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,022
-Finish getting dressed.
-Pardon?

484
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,195
-Min-ja!
-Wash your hands.

485
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,032
Your fly is open, so zip up.

486
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,993
Just kidding.

487
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,205
Min-ja!

488
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,792
Ice cream.

489
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,795
This is one thing no one delivers.

490
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,755
What's this?

491
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,007
Crazy psychos!

492
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,679
Someone in Korea
conducted these tests in a town?

493
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,640
One of the researchers
took the video herself.

494
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,560
The others went to meet her today.

495
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,562
Go help them out.

496
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,314
Answer me first then.

497
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,485
You and that kid, Seo Jeong-hu...

498
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,821
He's Healer, right?

499
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,324
You need to be honest with me
if you want me to help!

500
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,909
-Yoon Dong-won.
-Whatever.

501
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,744
Confess already.

502
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,249
He's Healer,
and you're his partner, right?

503
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,880
I have seven current addresses
of hackers you've been chasing

504
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,298
for the past five years.

505
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,466
What?

506
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,509
Seven?

507
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,554
Including Devil Wing's?

508
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,556
I'll throw in the name and the address

509
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,933
of the guy who cracked
Samo Bank's firewall last year.

510
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,488
You'll see Boss' genius hacker,
Mr. Ahn or whatever,

511
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,572
at the airport today.

512
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:35,868
Min-ja.

513
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,454
Let me ask you something.

514
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,707
People aren't all that different.

515
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,710
But we can tell

516
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:51,050
whether someone should live or die
for a better world.

517
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,511
Which is it

518
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,888
for Seo Jeong-hu?

519
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,183
What?

520
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,393
Come on!

521
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,272
CHEONGJU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

522
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:23,582
Kim Mun-ho completely trusts you,

523
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,377
so stick by his side.

524
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,796
Stick by his side.

525
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,340
Once you meet Kim Jae-yun,

526
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,094
confirm that she has the bacteria.

527
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,513
Confirm the package.

528
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,847
Once you've secure it,

529
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,058
kill her.

530
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,061
Kill her?

531
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,813
Wait.

532
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,440
You don't have to do it yourself.

533
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,151
Behind you.

534
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,200
Just bring her near him.

535
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,995
It's simple.

536
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,666
Simple?

537
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,888
Come on.

538
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,020
Yeong-sik, follow him.
You guys, come with me.

539
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,943
That's Seo Jeong-hu, right?

540
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,029
He's obviously working with them.

541
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,949
Those guys are from Double S Guard.

542
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,521
Jeong-hu.

543
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,120
We can't act too friendly.

544
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,622
Must we go this far?

545
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,290
This is Plan B.

546
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,501
If this fails,
we'll have to go for Plan C.

547
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,045
This can be dangerous.

548
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,424
No, this is already very dangerous.

549
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,469
-Sir.
-Let's think this over.

550
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,512
Is that a habit?

551
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,306
-What?
-Just thinking all the time.

552
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,768
You run simulations
but never play the game itself.

553
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,147
Can't you let me win once, you brat?

554
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,189
Uncle.

555
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,025
What did you just say?

556
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,027
I won't say it twice.

557
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,871
The passengers from Dalian
are starting to come out.

558
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,751
UNDER MAINTENANCE

559
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,052
Kim Jae-yun should call soon. Stand by.

560
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,308
Stand by your man

561
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,686
Ms. Jo.

562
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,488
Kim Mun-ho speaking.

563
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,284
Stand next to Kim Mun-ho
so we can hear the call,

564
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,496
and don't take that out.

565
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,376
Kim Jae-yun? Yes, I'm waiting.

566
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,005
You'll see me when you walk out.

567
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,592
You saw my face on the news, right?

568
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,887
I'm quite famous.

569
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,976
I'm Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.
I work with Kim Mun-ho.

570
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,104
He'll be waiting by the exit
when you come out.

571
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,107
Ignore him and turn left,
you'll see an escalator.

572
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,610
Head to the second-floor ladies' room.

573
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,255
-Kim Jae-yun.
-Pardon?

574
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,841
-Let's go this way.
-Wait, I'm...

575
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,927
When was the last time you were in Korea?

576
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,019
How was your flight?

577
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,689
I'm not Kim Jae-yun.

578
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,149
-You're not?
-No.

579
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,694
I guess you're not Kim Jae-yun. Oh, my.

580
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,613
I'm sorry, I must have had
the wrong description.

581
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,864
I'm sorry.

582
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,117
I'm sorry.

583
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,224
I'm Someday News' Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

584
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,816
You're boarding a flight to Beijing
in 30 minutes, right?

585
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,781
This is the last sample of the bacteria.

586
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:35,162
This flash drive
has all of our research files.

587
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,918
Until you board,

588
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,880
may I ask for an interview?

589
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,762
I know it's not an ideal spot, but...

590
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,643
I guess it's too dangerous.
Never mind then.

591
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,769
I have

592
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,104
requested asylum.

593
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,899
Will this interview help my case?

594
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,553
We're ready. Please begin.

595
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,056
Okay. Got it.

596
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,892
-Reporter Yoo! Now!
-Yes?

597
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:41,603
-Okay!
-Now!

598
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,357
Hello, I'm Someday News'
Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

599
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,193
Someday is at an airport right now

600
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:53,031
to meet a biochemist
that came from Russia through China.

601
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,249
It's still okay.
Let's wait a little longer.

602
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,563
We'll show you a video first.

603
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,483
Do you all remember
the Dugok-ri Horror last September?

604
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,401
DUGOK-RI VILLAGE HALL

605
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,654
Everyone in a town came down
with an unknown disease,

606
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,906
and five of them ended up dead.

607
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,367
There was suspicion

608
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,579
that this was an illegal test
conducted by a research team.

609
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,833
We discovered the bacteria
while studying water quality.

610
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,628
They deliberately increased its toxicity

611
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,132
to conduct secret studies
of its harmful effects on humans.

612
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,093
Why would they do such a thing?

613
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,471
From what I heard,
it's to contaminate the water.

614
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,016
It's to claim that a private corporation
should manage the water supplies.

615
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,851
In other words, privatization.

616
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,312
It's to convince the public.

617
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,488
Check all the ladies' rooms
at the airport.

618
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,489
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

619
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,618
Seo Jeong-hu, where are you?
They began the broadcast.

620
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,162
If you can't stop this,
you're absolutely done.

621
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,559
Don't do it.

622
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,394
I'm against it. Let's stop here.

623
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,736
What's going on, Reporter Chae?

624
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,213
Who is he?

625
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,182
You may scream.

626
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,651
What's this?

627
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,659
I've secured the package.

628
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,791
The camera.

629
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,461
-Get rid of it! Now!
-Come here.

630
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,088
Stop filming.

631
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:04,014
-What are you doing?
-What the...

632
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,807
-Are you nuts?
-What is this?

633
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,808
You're dead.

634
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,935
Who are you people?

635
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,353
Push through them!

636
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,271
Are you nuts?

637
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,981
-Yeong-sin.
-Back off.

638
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,733
Take the camera!

639
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,734
Ms. Kim!

640
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,695
Yeong-sin!

641
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,280
Let's wrap this up.

642
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,326
Yeong-sin, no!

643
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,497
Stop!

644
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,596
-Call an ambulance!
-Jeong-hu!

645
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,182
Jeong-hu!

646
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,142
Call an ambulance! Call 911!

647
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,895
Jeong-hu, please.

648
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,902
Jeong-hu.

649
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:03,049
A shoot-out at the airport
resulted in a death.

650
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,887
He was an assassin
hired to kill a whistleblower

651
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,265
during a live broadcast.

652
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,059
Yes, I feared for my life.

653
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,310
KIM JAE-YUN
INFORMANT

654
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,354
But people have a conscience.

655
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,692
I had to say something.

656
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,113
It has been revealed

657
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:29,242
that CEO Park Jeong-dae of Omega Holdings
hired this assassin.

658
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:33,580
This is a video from L.A.
that we just obtained.

659
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:38,376
It shows Park Jeong-dae
meeting with a Russian chemist, Nicholai.

660
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,587
The Prosecutor's Office

661
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,298
intends to prosecute Park
for the Dugok-ri case.

662
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,425
The assassin that was killed

663
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,385
has been revealed to be a man
named Park Bong-su.

664
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,638
He is said to have used several names

665
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:55,101
and was suspected
of many other cases in the past.

666
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,665
Yeong-sin, no!

667
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:22,879
Stop!

668
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,518
-Call an ambulance!
-Jeong-hu!

669
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,103
Jeong-hu!

670
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:43,775
Jeong-hu!

671
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,611
Jeong-hu...

672
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,988
Jeong-hu!

673
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,034
Jeong-hu!

674
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:01,209
WANTED FOR MURDER

675
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:07,632
IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION,
PLEASE CALL GANGNAM POLICE STATION

676
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,177
-Chief, good work.
-Good work.

677
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,178
You too.

678
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,813
Hello, Chief Kang.

679
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,762
Where are you now?

680
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,140
Five, four,

681
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,311
three, two, and one.

682
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,366
I'm Someday News' Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

683
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,619
You were in a wheelchair
at court yesterday.

684
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,078
Are you better already?

685
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,165
May I ask you a few questions?

686
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,001
Or I'll call your secretary
to request an interview!

687
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,948
Things I like.

688
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,450
The sound of his camera shutter,

689
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,452
his big hands,

690
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,287
his smiling eyes,

691
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,831
and deep embrace.

692
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,693
Things I dislike.

693
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,613
All that keeps me away from those things.
