1
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,592
Stop.

2
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,302
Boss said not to let you...

3
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,889
Are you all right?

4
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,325
Boss, we couldn't catch him.

5
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,161
One of the delivery men
went after him for now.

6
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,245
What should we do?

7
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,290
Boss!

8
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,135
So,

9
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,763
where did he go?

10
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,024
Kim Mun-ho speaking.

11
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,902
Do you remember Ki Yeong-jae?

12
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,989
I heard you used to be close
back in the day.

13
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,284
He's dead.

14
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,328
Request an autopsy right away.

15
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,039
Get all the security footages
from the police station,

16
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,041
especially the floor
of the interrogation room.

17
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,252
From last night until 8:00 a.m. today.

18
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,837
Gyeong-seok, do it right now

19
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,881
before someone in the station
messes with it.

20
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,341
Now. Okay.

21
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,435
Excuse me.

22
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,646
Only authorized personnel are allowed.

23
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,605
The morgue...

24
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,576
MORGUE

25
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,012
RESTRICTED AREA

26
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,194
Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

27
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,988
Yes, hello.

28
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,824
I'm Yoon Dong-won,
the cybercrimes detective.

29
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,536
We spoke on the phone before.

30
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,707
What are you doing here?

31
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,383
It isn't true, right?

32
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,594
Right?

33
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,854
I still remember.

34
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,983
You played a joke on me
just like this before.

35
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,195
So give it a rest and get up.

36
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,376
Master.

37
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,383
You're taking it way too far.

38
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,389
Stop...

39
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,479
Stop it already.

40
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,423
Wait. What's this?

41
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,216
Stay back.

42
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,219
Sir?

43
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,864
Are you okay?

44
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,372
Are you okay?

45
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,334
Someone will be right here.

46
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,421
Yeong-jae.

47
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,550
Do you know him?

48
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,052
Yes.

49
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,680
I knew him.

50
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,557
Tell me.

51
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,395
How did you know to come here
when he just passed away?

52
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,192
He was like family to me.

53
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,406
My family member died,

54
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,242
so I should know.

55
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,972
Yeong-jae.

56
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,143
I'll take it from here.

57
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,368
Team three was handling
Ki Yeong-jae's case, right?

58
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,247
Tell them that I think
someone came to the hospital.

59
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,250
I'm not sure if he came
because of Ki Yeong-jae,

60
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,710
but tell them...

61
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,473
Hey, listen carefully.

62
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,976
Everyone from our team
who isn't part of the operation

63
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,270
must protect the police firewall.

64
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,271
Today...

65
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,566
No, tomorrow at the latest,
we will surely have unwanted guests.

66
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,610
The target is Ki Yeong-jae's statement.

67
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,238
We'll set a trap, wait quietly,
and catch them then.

68
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,375
You should have seaweed soup
on your birthday.

69
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,003
Birthday.

70
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,963
Seaweed soup.

71
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,382
That is customary.

72
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,508
What about cake?

73
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,303
A cake is baked by a stranger.

74
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,223
Meanwhile, your master
is personally making you this soup.

75
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,100
How can you even compare the two?

76
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,560
That's why I want a cake.

77
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,773
Do you even know how to make this?

78
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,609
I learned from the lady
at the corner store.

79
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,779
Water.

80
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,947
Beef.

81
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,577
And seaweed.

82
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,669
Don't you need to wash that?

83
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,340
The boiling water will kill all the germs.

84
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,692
What the hell?

85
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,625
Ta-da.

86
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,335
Look, it's my certificate.

87
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,423
"The above has passed the GED

88
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,968
and is therefore granted this
Certificate of High School Equivalency."

89
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,470
See? Now, hand it over.

90
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,932
Damn you. You really pulled it off.

91
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,893
Give me the briefcase.

92
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,860
I worked so hard to get this.

93
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,861
I can't believe--

94
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,531
Is the secret to martial arts really here?

95
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,117
Learning this will make me
three times better, right?

96
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,618
You better be right.

97
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,745
It may vary for each person.

98
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,123
A blank slate like you

99
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,833
will probably...

100
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,918
improve a lot.

101
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,046
Give it to me. You promised.

102
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,675
Hand it over.

103
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,260
Come on, give me that.

104
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,261
Come on.

105
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,390
Sir, please. What are you doing?

106
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,479
Okay.

107
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,699
What's this?

108
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,701
"Lonely Lady. Please Don't..."

109
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,830
You pervert, I'm going to--

110
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,874
Those were very difficult to find!

111
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,110
Jeong-hu, please.

112
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,739
Some woman called
and said you'll come here.

113
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,449
She asked me to stop you
before it's too late.

114
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,243
Wait. Just stop!

115
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,956
She said you are going
to kill that bastard.

116
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,917
You're not going to, right?

117
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,834
Move.

118
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,381
Don't do it!

119
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,591
Will you become a murderer
because of those low-lives?

120
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,009
Why should you?

121
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,190
Damn it!

122
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,409
Yeong-jae wouldn't have
wanted this either.

123
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,952
You know that, right?

124
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,709
Fine.

125
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,169
What am I supposed to do then?

126
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,629
I'll find a way.

127
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,174
-We can--
-What are you talking about?

128
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,968
I mean right this instant.

129
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,429
Let me do something, would you?

130
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,763
There is

131
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,932
nothing that

132
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,895
I can do, so...

133
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,190
Tell me what I'm supposed to do!

134
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,860
I was like that too.

135
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,070
It was hard for me too

136
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,407
because my hands were tied
for these past 20 years.

137
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,247
So,

138
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,792
give me a little more time.

139
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,170
I swear I'll find a way.

140
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,671
I...

141
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,257
I called Master here.

142
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,511
He didn't want to come,
but I called him here.

143
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,471
Jeong-hu.

144
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,223
I made him say things
he didn't want to say

145
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,144
and got angry at him when he told me.

146
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,897
I was too busy being angry.

147
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,108
He came back after eight years,

148
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,154
but I didn't even have
a single meal with him.

149
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,115
But...

150
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,661
But you know, that old geezer...

151
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,665
Just cry.

152
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,625
It's okay to cry.

153
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,670
Just cry, Jeong-hu.

154
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,801
That old geezer...

155
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,566
I promise.

156
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,694
We'll get those jerks

157
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,365
and the scumbags standing behind them.

158
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,119
I'll make them pay.

159
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,250
Trust me.

160
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,420
-How?
-Jeong-hu.

161
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,963
What else can you do

162
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,966
other than stopping me?

163
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,997
Reporter Lee.

164
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,498
-Yes?
-Back there too.

165
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,918
It's so nice.

166
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,463
Hello, ma'am.

167
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,716
I'm Reporter Lee Byeong-jin
of Asia Monthly.

168
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,428
-Hello.
-I'm so sorry.

169
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,889
I know you need to rest.

170
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,477
While we're at it, let's take a few more.

171
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,854
Mr. Kim, your happy married life
is legendary.

172
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,939
Please.

173
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,109
Will you be okay?

174
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,784
Yes, that's good.

175
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,327
-Like this?
-Yes.

176
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,746
Ma'am, a big smile, please.

177
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,550
It must have been difficult
to decide to run for mayor.

178
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,512
It's a spot that was vacated
because of Kim Ui-chan's scandal,

179
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,390
and you have no experience in politics.

180
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,562
I believe my lack of experience
is exactly the reason why I was selected.

181
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,564
After the previous candidate's scandal,

182
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,400
our party's priority is to provide

183
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,821
transparency and credibility.

184
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,449
This is also my weakness,
but I'm consistent through and through.

185
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,326
I can't hide anything.

186
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,328
It's a big problem.

187
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,249
Isn't he picking up?

188
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,085
-Weren't you together all night?
-The number you've dialed...

189
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,086
I know.

190
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,632
He went out for a run in the morning,
but he never came back.

191
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,554
Doesn't Bong-su have a habit
of running away when he's scared?

192
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,973
Maybe he saw something scary

193
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,058
in the middle of the night
or early in the morning.

194
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,812
What about me?

195
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:11,066
What did you do to make him
run away first thing in the morning?

196
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,237
He's isn't calling,
and not even showing up at work.

197
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,407
I'm terribly curious.

198
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,867
So am I.

199
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,744
-What the--
-Park Bong-su is taking a few days off.

200
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,663
I guess I'm late too.

201
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,498
The meeting will start in 30 minutes.

202
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,959
All right, in 30 minutes. Let's get ready.

203
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,507
Yes?

204
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,262
I would like to discuss
something with you.

205
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,389
-Come in.
-Thank you.

206
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:51,106
We're doing a story on Kim Mun-sik.

207
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,024
So?

208
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,278
Honestly, our goal is to
dig up dirt on him.

209
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,571
That's right.

210
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,450
That's why I think we should meet him.

211
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,453
Shouldn't we ask him in person?

212
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,247
"We believe you are corrupt
for these reasons.

213
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,415
Are we correct?"

214
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,250
You're right.

215
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,418
The problem is this.

216
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,839
Would he accept our request
for an interview?

217
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,133
So,

218
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,594
could you pull some strings?

219
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,304
You're brothers after all.

220
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,555
Not as of today.

221
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:24,932
Pardon?

222
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,099
I've decided that

223
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,603
Mun-sik and I are no longer brothers.

224
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,271
Not anymore.

225
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,272
I see.

226
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,027
Brothers should get along though...

227
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,072
Then, I'll request an interview myself.

228
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,074
Do you really want to meet Mun-sik?

229
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,575
Actually,

230
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,954
I want to meet his wife.

231
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:53,252
I saw this while
sifting through old articles.

232
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,088
They say he and his wife
have a great relationship.

233
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,340
Here. She's his wife, and...

234
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,093
That's right.

235
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,011
She's your sister-in-law.

236
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,055
It's so confusing. Here.

237
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,140
Take a look.

238
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,727
They say their relationship
is like no other.

239
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,938
I mean, all the articles use terms like

240
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,108
soul siblings, eternal devotion,

241
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,985
and legendary lovebirds.

242
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,362
So?

243
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,030
So,

244
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,535
I know you think poorly
of President Kim Mun-sik.

245
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,455
I know you believe
he shouldn't become the mayor of Seoul.

246
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,376
You're close to him,
so you must know him better than anyone.

247
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,294
But

248
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:40,757
the small emotional
and dramatic side of me says that

249
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,887
someone who can cherish and love
one woman all his life

250
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,516
may not be such a bad guy after all.

251
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,269
I could be wrong but still...

252
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,272
I may be biased,

253
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,441
so you'd like to meet him
and judge for yourself.

254
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,860
Yes. I'm sorry.

255
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,489
First, I'd like to meet his wife.

256
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:08,994
Let me consider it.

257
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,912
Thank you.

258
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,790
I'll get going then.

259
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,462
Right.

260
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,341
Did Bong-su call you
and say he wasn't coming in?

261
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,342
He isn't well.

262
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,470
How? Was he hurt?

263
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,889
I assume it's a cold.

264
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,391
I see.

265
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,366
Bong-su.

266
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,744
Do you have a cold? Are you sick?

267
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,788
Can't you call?

268
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,831
Then at least text...

269
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,465
Bong-su.

270
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,597
WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME?

271
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,588
Hey, Yeong-jae.

272
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:48,510
I plan to use my special powers
that I haven't used in a while.

273
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,263
So cheer me on from there.

274
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,437
Yoon Dong-won, have you been waiting?

275
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,738
Hey! What happened?

276
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,241
A backdoor must've been planted
into our firewall.

277
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,325
Move.

278
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,660
What's the status?

279
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,329
It's strange.
They're coming in all at once.

280
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,831
I've never seen anything like this.

281
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,583
I've seen this many times before.

282
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:24,588
She comes in like this
and disappears like a ghost.

283
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,591
Then she appears again out of nowhere.

284
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,969
Look at that.

285
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,139
That's it. Just like this.

286
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,865
If I catch you dozing off again,
you're dead.

287
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,411
The guys we chased for four months
are in there.

288
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,206
We'll raid them as soon as
we get the warrant.

289
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,584
You can't let them touch their computers.

290
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,216
That really hurts.

291
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,343
Can you afford to dawdle,
be dazed and confused

292
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,180
like this one was at the Saewoon Mall case

293
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,350
so that the culprits find the time
to delete all the files?

294
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,185
Should that happen again?

295
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,145
No.

296
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,941
As soon as we open the front door,
we run in.

297
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,318
Secure their computers first.

298
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,694
So when

299
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,822
are we getting that stupid warrant?

300
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,410
What time is it?

301
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,162
It's very late.

302
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,794
Why can't you ever learn?
You always fall for it.

303
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,484
I'm sorry, but I can't today.

304
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,486
I need to be here.

305
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,155
My team is still too young
to leave unsupervised.

306
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,412
-I'll be done soon--
-You call yourself a mom?

307
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,873
Jo Min-ja, get over here right now!

308
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,626
Fine, I'll come.

309
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,253
I'm coming right now.

310
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,263
Is your son very ill?

311
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,973
How old is he again?

312
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,474
Four.

313
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,853
How many surgeries
can a four-year-old handle?

314
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,942
Just go to the hospital.

315
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,529
We'll figure things out here.

316
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,742
The warrant was just issued.

317
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:02,829
Let's go.

318
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,167
What? They're here!

319
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,460
They fell into the trap!

320
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,919
-Get them!
-I will.

321
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,512
What?

322
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,056
It's a virus!

323
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,538
You call yourself a mom?

324
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,334
How can you consider yourself as one?

325
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,628
If you were a mom...

326
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,588
If you were a mom,

327
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,549
you would have been

328
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,428
by your child when he was dying.

329
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,600
I know you worked hard,
but the order is from the higher-ups.

330
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,102
Bury it.

331
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,814
Delete all the documents you obtained.

332
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,191
Are you listening to me?

333
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,736
Not a single letter must be left on file.

334
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,858
I got the video
of your master's statement.

335
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,484
I watched it first

336
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,696
and I think he was making
a statement to you, not the police.

337
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,116
I became Healer a year
after being released from prison.

338
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,826
The name Healer

339
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,329
was the name of a magazine
my friends and I created in high school.

340
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,332
It sounded cool. "Healer."

341
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,793
What was your most recent job?

342
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,714
You know the owner
of Jeil News, Kim Mun-sik?

343
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,174
He was my client.

344
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,679
I do anything people pay me to do.

345
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,641
I don't care about morals or justice.

346
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:33,188
Gosh, I should have cared a little.

347
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,316
They are sort of like street signs.

348
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,695
They guide you when you don't know
which way to go.

349
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,864
"There is a cliff ahead.

350
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,407
Construction zone.

351
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,410
Turn back."

352
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,790
Do you know Ko Seong-cheol?

353
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,875
He came from L.A.

354
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,336
Did you kill him? Was that a job?

355
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,339
I don't take on jobs like that.

356
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:03,927
If a person kills another person,
you're no longer a human being.

357
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:08,973
I need to die as a human being
so that I can see them again,

358
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,892
the people I want to see.

359
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,811
The people who left first.

360
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,814
There is one thing I regret though.

361
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,399
I should have quit sooner.

362
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,114
I should have quit,
lived with the woman I loved,

363
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:30,870
have two kids, one dog,
two cats, and three goldfish

364
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,831
and raised them well.

365
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,335
I should have, right?

366
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,092
What happened?

367
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,678
You don't need to watch the rest.

368
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,975
-Why not?
-You heard what you needed to.

369
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,351
It's your master's last wish.

370
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,313
"The woman you love, two kids,
dogs, cats, and goldfish."

371
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,233
Do you want me to make you a new identity?

372
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,027
Or do you want to permanently stay
as Park Bong-su?

373
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,572
Consider it your retirement pension.

374
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,159
-It's too late.
-What is?

375
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,828
She...

376
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,123
She knows everything.

377
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,958
She knows who I am.

378
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,711
I'll wait, but...

379
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,972
What do you mean?
What does Chae Yeong-sin know?

380
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,557
Does she know that you're Healer?

381
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,225
She knows, but she's saying nothing?

382
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,144
No, she doesn't know everything.

383
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,731
She probably doesn't know

384
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,150
that she will be hurt
if she stays with me,

385
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,945
and she may even be killed.

386
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,280
What are you saying?

387
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,578
There is nothing I can do.

388
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,914
I should just sleep.

389
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,459
All right, get some rest.

390
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,629
-But does Yeong-sin really--
-Ms. Jo.

391
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,798
-What?
-Nothing. It's nothing.

392
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,450
CHAE YEONG-SIN

393
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,161
CHAE YEONG-SIN

394
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,038
HOW CAN YOU NOT EVEN CALL?
DO YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH?

395
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,099
It's a ten-minute slot,
so the interview isn't enough.

396
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,684
Find something we can throw in.

397
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,893
Okay.

398
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,109
-When is Sponsorship Night?
-Well...

399
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,124
I'm sorry.

400
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,625
Right.

401
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,336
You should be sorry.

402
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,964
-Did you write a letter of apology?
-I did.

403
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,299
Luckily, I was able to keep my job.

404
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:34,178
Of course, they don't have anyone
as good as you here.

405
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,477
-I'm sorry.
-You're not here just to apologize.

406
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,441
-Why are you here?
-No, I really came to apologize.

407
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,442
It's okay.

408
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,986
I know what kind of a person you are.

409
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,822
I blame myself for often forgetting it.

410
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,823
Am I

411
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,366
that horrible?

412
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,826
Why are you here?

413
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,911
There's someone
who was like a brother to me,

414
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,456
and he recently died.

415
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,126
-So?
-I think someone I know killed him.

416
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,298
Are you here as an informant?

417
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,009
There's a kid with whom I was close to
when I was young,

418
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,678
and he's been off the grid for days.

419
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,431
Today makes it three.

420
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,474
Mun-ho.

421
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,854
If you look at the contacts here,

422
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,564
they have groups.

423
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,357
Work, family, friends.

424
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,901
But did you know this?

425
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,655
I have only one entry
under the group "friends."

426
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,116
-You.
-What are you doing?

427
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,410
I came to talk to that friend.

428
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,579
I realized I had no one else to talk to.

429
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,209
Don't I seem lonely and pathetic?

430
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:50,213
You're not the type to seek out friends
because you're lonely.

431
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,757
-That's harsh.
-You're scared.

432
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,677
You know you have a lot of fear.

433
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,554
Do I?

434
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,390
Everyone says you're brave,

435
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:03,851
but that's not true.

436
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,021
You never fight up
until the point you get hurt.

437
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,817
You run away when
you meet a truly scary adversary

438
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,486
by making up some believable excuse.

439
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,862
Do I?

440
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,323
That's why you survived this long.

441
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,827
Don't be ashamed.

442
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,831
We're all the same.

443
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,756
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

444
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,675
Would you help me find this address?

445
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,595
That address doesn't exist.

446
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,849
I've been a realtor here
for over 20 years.

447
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,478
PERSONNEL FILE

448
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,689
Yeong-sin!

449
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,360
Someday is a war zone
due to the Kim Mun-sik Special.

450
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,738
We're short-staffed.
So what are you doing, Bong-su?

451
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,282
If you're sick, call and let us know.

452
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,576
If you don't want to come,
call and say so.

453
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,538
In 1997, Jeil News was in trouble, right?

454
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,876
The owner wanted to sell the paper.

455
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,129
It's been four days, Bong-su.

456
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,048
Don't think you'll still have your job

457
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,634
after not showing up
without even calling in.

458
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,095
It's too late for you.

459
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,515
You've lost your last chance
to gain my forgiveness.

460
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,561
Even if you come and beg, it's too late.

461
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,355
It's over. The end!

462
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,904
It's me, Yeong-sin.

463
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,283
It's been five days now.

464
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,078
Did I

465
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,998
do something wrong?

466
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,712
Is it because I said I'd wait?

467
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,923
Is that why you can't come?

468
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,430
Should I have said I wouldn't wait

469
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,725
and not to worry about me?

470
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,565
What if I took it back?

471
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:33,960
Kim Mun-sik will be doing
a live interview this weekend with ABS.

472
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,797
We'll take that
and air timed counter-broadcasts.

473
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,007
"Timed counter-broadcasts"?

474
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,843
He will answer the questions
posed to him, right?

475
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,011
"What do you like?"

476
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,429
"I like kimchi stew."

477
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,641
Then we'll do a broadcast on that
within ten minutes.

478
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,520
"Does Kim Mun-sik truly like kimchi stew?
Is he telling the truth?"

479
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,691
Then we'll need to know
what questions they will ask

480
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,109
during the interview.

481
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,277
Yes, we must.

482
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,072
The good thing is,
they won't ask and answer freely.

483
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,367
They will stick to scripted
questions and answers.

484
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,371
So how will we get those questions?

485
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,708
-Jong-su.
-Yes?

486
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,044
Since you're a spy anyway,
you can be a double agent.

487
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,838
But you see,

488
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,007
I'm going to be promoted
to managing editor

489
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,217
at Jeil News in three months.

490
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,722
Is that a no?

491
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,851
-Do you just need the script?
-Yes.

492
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,063
By the way, where's Yeong-sin?

493
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,570
Jeez.

494
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,034
-Why do you look so dazed?
-I'm fine now.

495
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,959
I'm sorry.

496
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,669
Is the meeting over?

497
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,629
Give me your phone.

498
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:07,678
I won't make personal calls
during work hours again.

499
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,312
Save this number.

500
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,690
The name is...

501
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,151
Choi Myeong-hui.

502
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,237
She's Mun-sik's wife.

503
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,240
Thank you.

504
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,160
Call her yourself
and ask for an interview.

505
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,703
I will.

506
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,706
But...

507
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,544
if it looks like she won't agree
no matter hard I try,

508
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,756
may I mention your name?

509
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,591
Sure.

510
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,845
Thank you. I'll call her right away.

511
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,846
Hello?

512
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,641
Hello, I'm Reporter Chae Yeong-sin
of Someday News.

513
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,562
May I speak with Ms. Choi Myeong-hui?

514
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,648
Yes, this is she.

515
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:29,361
Hello, I'm sorry for
suddenly calling you like this.

516
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,156
How did you get this number?

517
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,782
Well...

518
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,286
Kim Mun-ho gave it to me.

519
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,746
He's our company president.

520
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,623
Mun-ho is the president?

521
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,416
Is he not a reporter anymore?

522
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,629
He bought Someday News a while ago.

523
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,214
Didn't you know?

524
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,590
I did not.

525
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,009
I see.

526
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,929
Was it a secret? Oh, no.

527
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,765
Did Mun-ho tell you to call me
at this number?

528
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:04,271
Actually, I begged him for it
because I wanted to interview you.

529
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:05,856
That's strange.

530
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,067
He knows I don't meet people.

531
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,070
Please, Ms. Choi.

532
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,615
I would like to meet you
and ask you some questions.

533
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,744
Is this about
my husband's candidacy for mayor?

534
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,373
He may become the next mayor of Seoul.

535
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,751
That is a very important position.

536
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,419
We would be entrusting him

537
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,589
with millions of lives,
families, and livelihoods.

538
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,342
That's why I wanted to know

539
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:38,556
what the person closest to him
thought of him.

540
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,517
-Your voice...
-Pardon?

541
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,018
You have a pleasant voice.

542
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,771
Really?

543
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,526
Well, people always say

544
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,529
I look better than I sound.

545
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,031
That was a joke.

546
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,285
Will you give me some time
to think it over?

547
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,078
Of course.

548
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,082
Can I call you at this number
once I've made my decision?

549
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,294
Yes, I'm Chae Yeong-sin at Someday News.

550
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,838
I'll text you my information as well.

551
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,424
Okay. I'll get back to you.

552
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,343
Thank you.
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

553
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,038
CALLING

554
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,206
Did you find it?

555
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,000
I found it, but...

556
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,343
This car looks like
it hasn't been used for a month.

557
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,354
He hasn't ridden his bike
in a while either.

558
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,022
There is a thick layer of dust.

559
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,107
Is there anywhere else?

560
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,568
That is his last car

561
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,739
which means he hasn't been moving.

562
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,658
So he's been home.

563
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,120
Just tell me where he lives.
I'll head over there.

564
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,747
You can't find it even if you go.

565
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,123
Why not?

566
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:33,879
Because you won't be able to go in
unless he lets you in.

567
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,608
Excuse me.

568
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,027
We're not open yet.

569
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,155
-We'll be open in 30 minutes.
-Then open up now.

570
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:01,698
Right now.

571
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,619
Okay.

572
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,377
What would you like?

573
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,046
-Don't you have any women?
-Excuse me?

574
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,590
I refuse to place my order to a man.

575
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,517
-Uncle, can I have some milk?
-Sure.

576
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,352
Here's a woman.

577
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,064
Miss? Please take my order.

578
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,649
Sorry?

579
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,026
Don't go.

580
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:43,031
I bet she found out
her husband was cheating,

581
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,909
and wants to lash out at any woman.

582
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,995
Miss! My order!

583
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,497
What a lousy way to start the morning...

584
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,749
Calm down. I'll go.

585
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,252
All I need to do is take her order.

586
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,713
No wonder her husband cheated on her.

587
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,553
What would you like?

588
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:12,144
If you want breakfast,
we have breakfast sets here--

589
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,520
Have a seat.

590
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:14,938
Excuse me?

591
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,985
Well, I actually don't work here--

592
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:20,986
Sit.

593
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,364
Okay.

594
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,920
Don't you recognize my voice?

595
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,301
Chae Yeong-sin?
You know Park Bong-su, don't you?

596
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,348
Are you Bong-su's mother?

597
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,518
I am definitely not his mother.

598
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:58,232
Bong-su hasn't shown up for work for days,
and I can't reach him.

599
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,651
-Give me your phone.
-My phone?

600
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,028
Here.

601
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,739
Is Bong-su sick?

602
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,242
Or did he leave the country?

603
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,953
But your phone can be on roaming
even if you're out of...

604
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,666
What are you doing?

605
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,669
He hasn't moved for six days.

606
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:22,631
I checked the supermarkets
and takeout eateries in the area,

607
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,760
and he hasn't even bought water,
let alone food.

608
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,723
I could go by his place,
but I don't know the way in.

609
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,559
So there's only one option.

610
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,728
We need him to open the door and come out.

611
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:50,409
How much of what I just said
do you understand?

612
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,327
Is he

613
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,496
okay?

614
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,416
Is he not okay?

615
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,339
Where is he? Please tell me.

616
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,845
Where is he? Please.

617
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,640
I had to see those eyes.

618
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,321
Bong-su.

619
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,781
Park Bong-su!

620
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,409
Is anyone there?

621
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,138
INFIRMARY

622
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,929
Is anyone here?

623
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,524
Bong-su.

624
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,413
Bong-su.

625
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,100
Why are you sleeping so deeply?

626
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,310
Open your eyes. Please?

627
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,524
This won't do.

628
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,401
Let's go to the hospital.

629
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,611
I'll take you.

630
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,330
I'm sorry. I dialed the wrong number.

631
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,799
Bong-su, it's me.

632
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,471
Awesome.

633
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,733
What a dream.

634
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,237
Are you sick?

635
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,865
Just how sick are you?

636
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,619
Your hand is freezing.

637
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,580
I'm cold.

638
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,460
Okay.

639
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,269
Is that a little warmer?

640
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,517
You. Stay right there.

641
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,395
I made egg porridge.

642
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,439
Taste it.

643
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,153
What kind of a dream is this?

644
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,199
How did you get in here?

645
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,826
Who got you in here? When?

646
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,958
Just taste this.

647
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,133
I took the day off from work.

648
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,719
I told my dad already,

649
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,305
so I'm staying here
until at least tomorrow.

650
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,642
You'll eat the food I make
whether you like it or not.

651
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:13,977
So...

652
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,521
How does it taste?

653
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,023
Is it salty? Bland?

654
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,236
Yeong-sin.

655
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,156
Right, I borrowed your clothes.
I hope you don't mind.

656
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,116
I don't know how you got in here,

657
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,497
but you shouldn't be here.

658
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,374
So leave.

659
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,544
Forget this place

660
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,338
and never come back.

661
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,299
Leave.

662
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,470
What?

663
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,348
Do I have to walk you out or something?

664
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,892
Is this the real you?

665
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,479
The person who's talking now.

666
00:55:59,105 --> 00:55:59,981
Is that the real you?

667
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,613
Bong-su isn't like this.

668
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,783
You're kind of scary.

669
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,868
Why don't you get it?

670
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,706
It took me an entire day to find you.

671
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,334
It's already evening,
so it's dark outside.

672
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,922
Let me stay until the sun rises
and the streets are brighter.

673
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,842
If you still tell me to leave, I will.

674
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,772
It's salty. It needs more water.

675
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,823
Yes, I know I should soak it in water,

676
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,283
but for how long?

677
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:34,993
What?

678
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,371
No, this isn't whole. It's cut up.

679
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:40,790
Rice water?

680
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,667
I threw that out.

681
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,422
Dad, I'll call you back. Bye.

682
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,803
You crash at my place
whenever you feel like it.

683
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,683
I'm just asking for one night.
This isn't fair.

684
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,852
I'm not leaving.

685
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,988
Why don't you know when to be scared?

686
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,283
I'm not afraid of you.

687
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,536
Don't you know who I am?

688
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,956
You have no idea how much

689
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,959
I'm hiding from you.

690
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,086
I don't care.

691
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:09,837
Are you stupid?

692
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:11,965
Don't send me away.

693
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,592
If you send me away,

694
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,512
you'll cry for the rest of your life.

695
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,102
I...

696
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,940
may hurt you.

697
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,441
No.

698
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,113
You'd never hurt me. Ever.

699
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,098
Don't send me away.

700
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,145
Please don't.
