1
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,772
What the hell?

2
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,775
Hey, look up.

3
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,070
Were you that scared?

4
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,287
You...

5
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,688
MOST SEARCHED CARS
SECRET CLEAR

6
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,440
That's it!

7
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,319
What the...

8
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,655
Did you press something?

9
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,166
-You...
-I can't hear you! Speak louder!

10
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
You're a hopeless

11
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,134
piece of trash.

12
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,957
-Sir!
-Sir!

13
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,292
Sir!

14
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,591
Bong-su!

15
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,217
Yeong-sin?

16
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,469
Are you okay?

17
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,179
Please help me.

18
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,931
Wait, come here.

19
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,229
Hey!

20
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,065
Stop the car!

21
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,083
This way!

22
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,418
Stop it!

23
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,836
-Bong-su.
-Yes?

24
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,129
It's noisy out there, isn't it?

25
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,300
Yes, it is quite noisy.

26
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,178
My reporter's instincts are telling me
not to miss this chance.

27
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,221
So, get ready.

28
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,598
What? Get ready?

29
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,599
The car key.

30
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,603
Right, the car key. Here.

31
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,480
We will run to the car.

32
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,398
You will run at lightning speed
and start the car.

33
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,983
I will run to you and lock the door.

34
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,027
And we get out of here. Ready?

35
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,322
Can't we switch roles?

36
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:04,244
Maybe you should drive and
and I take care of anything else.

37
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,372
If I had a driver's license,
why would I have brought you here?

38
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,706
Right.

39
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,709
-Ready?
-Ready.

40
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,796
-Go!
-Go!

41
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,802
We're coming out.
I need you to clear the path.

42
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,685
Hey, stop! Stop that!

43
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,603
Don't you dare scratch up my car!

44
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,689
Put it down! I said, put it down!

45
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,819
Give my car back!

46
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,038
Hey! Wait!

47
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,418
Clear the path?
Can I run over a few of them?

48
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,752
Gosh, whatever!

49
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,966
Stop messing with my car!

50
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:00,967
Stop it no matter what.

51
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,510
Hey!

52
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,812
The car key!

53
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,333
What on earth?

54
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,792
Get them!

55
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,059
Wasn't that Bae Sang-su's car?

56
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,781
Did you see that?
That was Bae Sang-su, right?

57
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,407
What in the world...

58
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,095
Mister! Please take us to the police!

59
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,100
Those people, those gangsters
are trying to kill us.

60
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,561
Bong-su, what's wrong? Are you hurt?

61
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,272
There they are!

62
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,235
-Catch them!
-There they are.

63
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,737
-Come here.
-Come here.

64
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,531
Hold on.

65
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,161
Use of force in broad daylight
by a large group

66
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,996
and possession of weapons?

67
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,206
Who is this punk?

68
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,333
Violent language and intimidation.

69
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,502
Keep going.

70
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,170
Who the heck...

71
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,255
Hey.

72
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,468
Hello, Detective Yoon.

73
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,303
What brings you here?

74
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,680
What about you?

75
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,224
What are you doing here, kid?

76
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,853
Are these boys all yours?

77
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,814
You're a detective?

78
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,732
Yes.

79
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,402
I'm Yoon Dong-won
of the Cyber Security Division.

80
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,197
You seem to have something
to report to the police.

81
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,950
I have some questions too.

82
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,535
You see...

83
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,582
Bong-su!

84
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,418
What? Where did he go?

85
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,186
Where are you?

86
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
Dae-yong is headed to the overpass.

87
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,733
Turn around at the three-way intersection
and get to the container yard.

88
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,401
Dae-yong, did you hear that?

89
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,925
You are a dead man.

90
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,639
Hey! Stop the car!

91
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,432
Stop the car!

92
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,124
I'm by the containers. Where are you?

93
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,418
Where do I go now?
Do I stop the car, or should I just go?

94
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,004
Why aren't you answering?

95
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,729
Hey! You jerk!

96
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,273
Come over here!

97
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,861
Who are you?

98
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,739
-You're a girl?
-Hey!

99
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,118
-What?
-Where are you?

100
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,703
What are you babbling about?

101
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,647
Hey!

102
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,982
Let me go!

103
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,941
Hey!

104
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,778
-Keep it down.
-That hurts!

105
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,283
Seriously, let's not tire ourselves out.

106
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,368
I'll leave after we chat.

107
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,996
You're Healer, aren't you?

108
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,497
Bingo.

109
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,166
I knew it.

110
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,378
I heard you show up
near that Someday reporter brat.

111
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,296
You're right.

112
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,257
What is your relationship with that brat?

113
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,970
You're a company president,
for goodness sake.

114
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,764
Watch your language.

115
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,600
The reason I showed up near her is because

116
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,603
I have been using her as bait.

117
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,229
Bait?

118
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,523
I wanted to meet quietly
with you like this.

119
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,111
I followed your boys
and they seemed interested in her.

120
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,322
So I followed her for a few days.

121
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:57,990
And look.

122
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,201
You fell right into the trap.

123
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,163
If you wanted to meet me,
you could have come to my...

124
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,748
Hey! What are you doing?

125
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,210
You use this one all the time.

126
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,216
-Hey!
-Don't laugh.

127
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,594
I don't see a lot of fingerprints on this,

128
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,179
so this one is for the VIP's.

129
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,847
What is your password?

130
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,227
You think I'll tell you that easily?

131
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,187
Goodness.

132
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,356
Did you really think...

133
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,149
What?

134
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,321
Let's see. The handcuffs show up nicely.

135
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,199
I'll post this on your company website.

136
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,867
Your boys would love it.

137
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,620
I'll title it "Captured by Lord Healer."

138
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,957
Face front. I told you to face front.

139
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,208
-Will you face front?
-Yes, sir.

140
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,420
I can break the code with time,
but it's annoying.

141
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,672
And the picture I just took?

142
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,216
I'll post it on Double S Guard's
customer message board.

143
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,552
The password.

144
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,974
V1. V, then 1.

145
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,185
V1.

146
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,397
It worked.

147
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,984
There is one entry in your contacts.

148
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:15,901
"Boss"?

149
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,736
That's my girlfriend. So what?

150
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,363
Any voice recordings?

151
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,408
Yes, there they are.

152
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,827
This is how you run a business.

153
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,915
Record all conversations with your client.

154
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,709
As they say, better safe than sorry.

155
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,669
Let's see, the newest recording is...

156
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,423
About the first job you requested of me...

157
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:42,011
You said to find Healer
and get rid of him.

158
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,013
But I think he is somehow
related to this reporter.

159
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,514
Hey.

160
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,477
There is something called ethics
in this business.

161
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,813
Sure there is, but I don't have any.

162
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,565
You're a total bully.

163
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:58,194
Hey, Healer is well-known as a classy guy.

164
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,530
But what is this? Threats and blackmail...

165
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,200
Were you always a dirty coward like this?

166
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,911
So, did you find out
where Joo Yeon-hui is hiding?

167
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,622
I'm positive the Someday reporter knows.

168
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,248
We are keeping a close eye on her.

169
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,459
-What about Healer?
-We found a way to

170
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,419
draw him out,
so we'll get rid of him soon.

171
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,964
Do it and call me once it's done.

172
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,092
This man.

173
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,764
-Who is he?
-Why? So, you can threaten him?

174
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,393
He's one of them, isn't he?

175
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,856
Do you want to tell me,

176
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,943
or should I call your boss
and ask him directly?

177
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,196
I'll send him the picture
I just took and say,

178
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,532
"Hello, I am Healer.

179
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,826
I heard all about you from your lackey.

180
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,996
You asked him to get rid of me?"
Should I do that?

181
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,332
Gosh, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

182
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,668
What is wrong with me?

183
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,546
I threatened you again.

184
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,091
Sang-su.

185
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,221
Yes?

186
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,016
Yes.

187
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,747
She just arrived at the police station.

188
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,875
It is definitely Joo Yeon-hui.

189
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,501
I'm positive.

190
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,430
I had the reporters of every company
publish the story.

191
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,641
The articles will be posted online today.

192
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,854
This isn't their first time.
Everyone will do their job.

193
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,412
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

194
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:19,126
So, you went to Mr. Hwang's house
to follow up on the story?

195
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:20,961
That's right.

196
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:26,508
And then, I saw Hwang Je-guk
attack one of his actresses.

197
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,552
I was almost attacked too.

198
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,305
There were many guys there, correct?

199
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,514
Do you know who they are?

200
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:37,478
They tried to kidnap me last time.

201
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,520
Kidnap?

202
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,524
One of them carries a toy. Like this.

203
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,153
He is definitely the one
who attacked me last time.

204
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,658
I reported it last time too,
but I didn't know exactly who they were.

205
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,744
Now that we know, I'll appreciate it
if you take care of it quickly.

206
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,664
You know Hwang Je-guk's
minions' address, right?

207
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,541
Is there anyone
who can corroborate your story?

208
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,128
Yes. My subordinate saw everything.
He was with me.

209
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,048
He was beaten up last time too.

210
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,300
He was hit? Was he examined at a hospital?

211
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,386
Well, that is...

212
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,347
Is he the one who hit my car and ran away?

213
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,017
He gets scared easily.

214
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,603
He has a habit of running away
when he gets scared too.

215
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,898
But think about it.
How scared must he have been?

216
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,651
Would you happen to know

217
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,570
a man named Ko Seong-cheol?

218
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,781
Who?

219
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:44,795
You don't?

220
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,423
If you would give me a hint...

221
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,635
Okay, Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

222
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,805
You wrote this story recently, correct?

223
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,308
Yes, that's mine.

224
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,438
I went to see Hwang Je-guk
to follow up on that story.

225
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,776
Is victim "J" in this article
Joo Yeon-hui?

226
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,573
Wow. Your deductive skills
are totally awesome.

227
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,284
It's not that my deduction skill
is awesome, but...

228
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,662
someone pressed charges against her.

229
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,789
Hwang Je-guk, to be precise.

230
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,667
Hwang Je-guk, that piece of trash!

231
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,671
He pressed charges against her?
Why? For what?

232
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,174
Someday News was also included
in that charge.

233
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,802
You and the editor-in-chief
were lumped all in one.

234
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,389
Let me run a quick search, please.

235
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,770
HWANG JE-GUK, JOO YEON-HUI

236
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,188
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT DESK

237
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,118
Excuse me.

238
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,705
Excuse me.

239
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,583
How much longer do we have to wait?

240
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,503
For what?

241
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,048
I told you, we're here
to give the victim's statement.

242
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,800
Just wait.

243
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,028
WOMAN THREATENS POLITICIAN

244
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,655
A PLOT BY A TEMPTRESS?

245
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,658
THE CHARGES TURNED OUT TO BE FAKE...

246
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,538
WARRANT ISSUED FOR
25-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, "J"

247
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,335
Excuse me.

248
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,004
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin?

249
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,091
I haven't been arrested, have I?

250
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,261
No, but I have a few questions--

251
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,638
I'm a reporter at Somday News,
so if you have questions,

252
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,598
call me there at any time.
You can always reach me.

253
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,891
I need to go. Have a nice day.

254
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,602
Excuse me, miss. Hey...

255
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,313
Miss Joo Yeon-hui?

256
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,901
Yes, she is Joo Yeon-hui.

257
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,528
And you are?

258
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,031
I'm her lawyer and I will be
with her during the process.

259
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,616
Wait...

260
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,411
I'm Attorney Chae Chi-su.

261
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,454
I see.

262
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,541
So, you must know
there is a warrant out for her arrest.

263
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,753
A warrant out for her arrest? Who?

264
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,264
Hey, Yeong-sin.

265
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,558
I'm at the police station.
I have to go. Bye.

266
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,354
Come on, Dad. Pick up.

267
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,025
"Suspect, Joo Yeon-hui.

268
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,195
Defamation based on lies
and exaggerations."

269
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,531
Your whereabouts were unknown.

270
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,241
Hence the warrant was issued.

271
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,660
Mr. Chae.

272
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,043
Excuse me.

273
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,005
We came here to give a statement
as the victim.

274
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,341
She'll have to undergo questioning
as a suspect too.

275
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,097
DIALING: DAD

276
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,275
REPORTER KIM MUN-HO

277
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,154
Gosh...

278
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,505
REPORTER KIM MUN-HO

279
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,183
Hello?

280
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,061
Hello, I'm Chae Yeong-sin of Someday News.

281
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,773
Do you remember me?

282
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,569
Yes, I remember.

283
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,323
Do you also remember telling me to call
if there is something I can't handle?

284
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:29,496
I really hate to admit it,
but that is why I'm calling you.

285
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,707
If I give you...

286
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,004
everything that I have gathered so far,
and my source, would you write a story?

287
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,423
Not just any story, but a proper one.

288
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,094
Is that source Joo Yeon-hui herself?

289
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,429
Yes.

290
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,641
Is it just her word,
or do you have other proof?

291
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,645
I have the texts she exchanged
with Hwang Je-guk and Kim Ui-chan.

292
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,565
I have the medical exam record
from the assault.

293
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,567
-What about the video?
-I'm sorry?

294
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,738
You said she was blackmailed
using a video.

295
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,947
You said that in your article.

296
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,742
I don't have...

297
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,412
the video.

298
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,541
Why would I be calling you right now
if I had it?

299
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,168
I would just reveal it myself.

300
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,463
We have no video and no power.

301
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,964
We have no money to go to court.

302
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,010
Even if we post the story,
a B-rated Internet news site like us

303
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,970
is dead if the website shuts us down.

304
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,639
But you said you can do it,
that you have the power.

305
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,808
Yeong-sin, listen carefully.

306
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm listening.

307
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,857
Before, the higher-ups
just blocked stories they didn't like.

308
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,693
So, all you had to do
was put your life on the line,

309
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,445
then you could get the story out.

310
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,446
But not anymore.

311
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,158
Now, they'll bury it
with countless garbage stories.

312
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,285
How can they do that?

313
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,663
Because people are entertained
by garbage than the truth.

314
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,581
So?

315
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,874
The truth?

316
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,543
Who cares about that anymore?

317
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,004
Then what are you proposing?

318
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,256
No one wants to know the truth.

319
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,675
You still want it to be out?

320
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,719
Goodness me.

321
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,516
Look here.

322
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:17,521
I just asked if you could publish
the story if I give it to you.

323
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,273
All you have to do is answer yes or no.

324
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,691
Why are you trying to teach me--

325
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,861
Why do you care so much?
You can walk away now.

326
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,032
Joo Yeon-hui is about to be
wrongfully imprisoned.

327
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,659
You want me to just sit back and watch?

328
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,663
You can't just watch,
so you're dumping it on me?

329
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,748
Gosh.

330
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,084
You're the one who nagged
and begged for it.

331
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,210
What?

332
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,215
We can put my name down as the source.

333
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,092
If anyone must get arrested,
I'll take the fall.

334
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,594
So all you have to do is
publish the story!

335
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,805
-Really?
-Yes!

336
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,896
What are you doing here?

337
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,607
I'm waiting for the homeowner.

338
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,653
You know the password.
Why did you wait outside?

339
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,699
I'm was worried about
what the owner would think.

340
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,661
That's why.

341
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,580
Kang Min-jae is worried about
what I would think?

342
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,375
This is main-news worthy.

343
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:21,918
Don't you agree?

344
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,132
I know a lawyer
in the law firm they are using.

345
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:31,136
I'll find out how many lawyers
they put on this case.

346
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,389
Darn it. These guys have
all the money in the world.

347
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,713
-Let's go inside.
-Yeong-sin.

348
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,173
Yeong-sin, why are you here?

349
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,424
-Come on.
-Joo Yeon-hui!

350
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,884
Joo Yeon-hui!

351
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,971
-Joo Yeon-hui!
-Joo Yeon-hui!

352
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,642
Joo Yeon-hui's case has been
transferred to local news.

353
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,772
The premise is about a new type
of blackmailing con artist.

354
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,107
"A blackmailing con artist"?

355
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,947
Young women target famous men
and approach them intentionally.

356
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:36,826
They induce a date or sexual relations,
and then ask for money or goods.

357
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,164
And a good example of this is
Joo Yeon-hui?

358
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,292
She is the worst of them all.

359
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,836
She and an entertainment reporter
published an article

360
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,383
and threatened an assemblyman
who is a future Seoul mayoral candidate.

361
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,928
There's a rumor that she demanded
three billion Won.

362
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,930
How much did you ask for exactly?

363
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,598
Is it three or four billion Won?

364
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,600
You pointed out an assemblyman
from the ruling party.

365
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,436
He says he met you once at a dinner.

366
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,814
-Which side is telling the truth?
-We'll answer questions later.

367
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,566
Is someone behind this,
or did you scheme it alone?

368
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,111
Did you come to turn yourself in?
Aren't you under custody?

369
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,237
Please move.

370
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,613
Are you working alone?

371
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,991
Did you contact an assemblyman
of the opposition party?

372
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,117
Who is he?

373
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,035
Just one word, please!

374
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,913
-Excuse me.
-Say something!

375
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,375
The sexual bribe incident
that lit up the Internet was

376
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,087
revealed to be a self-fabricated plot
by an actress-in-training.

377
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,217
This appears to be one of the latest scams
that young woman use for blackmail.

378
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,848
Here you go.

379
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:44,185
You really are good.

380
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,107
You learned how to cook
by helping your sister?

381
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,403
I wish I could try her food.

382
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,407
What about your first love?

383
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,952
Has she tried your sister's food?

384
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,540
You still remember that?
You should forget it.

385
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,959
What woman would forget
something like that?

386
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,130
We were a couple since we started work.

387
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,843
But no matter how long I waited,
the guy said nothing

388
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,180
so finally, the girl proposed
to the guy instead.

389
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,268
Do you realize how much courage
I had to muster up?

390
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,397
But...

391
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,942
the guy's response was this.

392
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,279
"Min-jae.

393
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,824
My first love is still in my heart.

394
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:45,246
So no matter how hard you try,
you won't be more than my second.

395
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,916
Are you okay with that?"

396
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,545
You said no.

397
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,632
What woman would say yes?

398
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,061
Let's toast to that first love.

399
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,479
That's enough.

400
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,440
I feel bad about it already.

401
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,528
Then shall we toast to
Reporter Kim Mun-ho's resignation?

402
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,115
That, I'll drink to. Cheers.

403
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,873
You're not going into
your brother's company, are you?

404
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,335
Who knows? Maybe.

405
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,797
No way.

406
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,842
Then you couldn't have quit so proudly.

407
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,678
You would have crawled out
silently and humiliated.

408
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,056
You can write a thesis on me,
you know that?

409
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,726
What is it?

410
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,312
At least give me an explanation.

411
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,649
You owe me that much, don't you?

412
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,575
There is a kid I want to mentor.

413
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,118
So?

414
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,246
I'll teach her the basics first.
She has potential.

415
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,790
-And then?
-And then...

416
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:12,917
would you take her in?

417
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:15,879
Is it a girl?

418
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,925
I told you, she's a kid.

419
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,636
But why do you have to leave?

420
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,473
You can bring her into our station.

421
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,391
You said no.

422
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,603
What do you mean?

423
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,939
You said we can't cover
Joo Yeon-hui's story.

424
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,985
I can't teach her properly like that.

425
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,156
Her dream is to become a real reporter.

426
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,952
What you just said...

427
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,123
What did you mean
by asking me to take her in?

428
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,375
What do you plan to do, then?

429
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,634
And who is she?

430
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,306
Is she related to your...

431
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,433
first love?

432
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,726
Min-jae.

433
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,102
Why...

434
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,982
Why do you make me say this?

435
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,402
Why must you make me this way?

436
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,309
I owe her a big debt.

437
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,437
It's weighing down on my heart.

438
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,691
I want to repay that debt.

439
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,942
Once you do...

440
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,445
will that first spot
in your heart become vacant?

441
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,535
That is my wish.

442
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,832
Once you do...

443
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,626
what comes next?

444
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,545
I'm going to leave.

445
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,505
Where to?

446
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,383
Alaska? Africa?

447
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,095
Somewhere very cold or very hot.

448
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:35,101
I have always lived
a very lukewarm life until now.

449
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,707
Are you sure
this is the right address, sir?

450
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,751
I'm on the fourth floor,
but there is nothing here.

451
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,338
Just leave it? Where?

452
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,007
Oh, I see it.

453
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,938
INFIRMARY

454
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,826
INFIRMARY

455
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,361
CONTACT LIST

456
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,697
MS. JO

457
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,200
MS. JO

458
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:42,121
Honey, I'm not in right now.

459
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,457
Leave me a message and

460
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,419
you have to end your final words
like this.

461
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,339
"I love you."

462
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,256
Seriously.

463
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,425
What on earth?

464
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,389
Ms. Jo, why are you out all day?
What are you doing?

465
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,976
Did you hear Bae Sang-su's recording?

466
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,728
It is definitely

467
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,232
Kim Mun-sik, the owner of
Jeil News, right?

468
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,859
The one who hired me
to get a file from Ko Seong-cheol.

469
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,822
The one who killed
Ko Seong-cheol and framed me, too.

470
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,367
Why else would he order
Bae Sang-su to get rid of me?

471
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,287
So, I was thinking...

472
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,375
I would like to get rid of him
myself instead.

473
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,961
But I need your help.

474
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,755
Seriously, where have you been all day?

475
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,133
You don't pick up
just because you're not at your desk?

476
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,176
Why do you think
it's called a mobile phone?

477
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,387
It's because you can move around
and answer...

478
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,764
Gosh.

479
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:46,018
Anyway, let's talk, okay?

480
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,521
Did you hear that?

481
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:54,402
Even if I don't tell him,
Jeong-hu will find out soon

482
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,362
that Kim Mun-sik was his dad's friend.

483
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,322
Did you hack into the security cameras?

484
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,615
I did.

485
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,076
You can breathe now.

486
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,504
Kim Mun-sik, his dad.
Me, his master, and Myeong-hui.

487
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,966
And Gil-han. He'll find out
we were all friends, right?

488
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,887
If you taught him well,
it's just a matter of time.

489
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,931
He'll find out how his dad died too.

490
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,183
He probably will, right?

491
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:30,563
Jeong-hu's mom told him
that his dad died in an accident,

492
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,482
but he'll find out the truth
with a little digging.

493
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,527
He can easily find
an old newspaper article from then.

494
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,654
Seo Jun-seok, born in 1960.

495
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,658
While being investigated for killing
his friend for money,

496
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,493
he was overwhelmed by guilt
and killed himself.

497
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,371
Detective Jo, you haven't changed.

498
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:51,125
That venomous tongue
that has no consideration for others.

499
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,879
Geez.

500
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,130
That's right.

501
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,549
You don't like being called a detective.

502
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,928
But you have spent
these past few years with Jeong-hu.

503
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,804
What do you think of him?

504
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:08,017
How would he react if he found out
what his father had done?

505
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,563
He's already a little weird.

506
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:19,153
What? His dream is to leave everything
and live alone on a deserted island?

507
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,949
That timid boy.

508
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,326
-Hey, traitor.
-What?

509
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,829
You lived with him for years
and you didn't know?

510
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,331
Know what?

511
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,376
Jeong-hu has never left anyone.

512
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,170
All the people around him left him.

513
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,881
His dad, his mom, his grandmother.

514
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,841
Even you, his master.

515
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,976
-Let's take a picture.
-Get up.

516
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,561
Mun-sik! Get over here.

517
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,856
You guys are so cheesy. How immature.

518
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,733
Look at him.

519
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,820
-Hey, smile!
-Let's go!

520
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:05,700
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

521
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,198
Bong-suk, is this your number?
It's me, Yeong-sin.

522
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,712
Hey, you stupid coward.

523
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,797
You left me behind
and ran away during that mess

524
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,716
and you don't even call?

525
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,634
Do you want to die?

526
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,680
What the...

527
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,531
Are you okay?

528
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,659
This is my number.
Let me know if you're okay.

529
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,995
I was too busy today to check on you.

530
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,747
You are okay, right?

531
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,834
I wish I could die just about now.

532
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,922
What the...

533
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,217
What is she talking about?

534
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,442
"Do you want to die?"

535
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,030
You have such a foul mouth. Seriously.

536
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,496
"Are you okay?

537
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,706
You are okay, right?"

538
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,835
Whatever.

539
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,012
I wish I could...

540
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,556
Die?

541
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,646
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

542
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,944
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

543
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,698
Have some hot chocolate.

544
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,908
You barely touched your dinner.

545
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,831
Miss, a soldier must eat before a battle.

546
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,082
You need the energy to fight.

547
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,668
Here, drink.

548
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,884
The amount they quote bothers me.

549
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,719
Did you ever mention a price?

550
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,803
Like, three billion Won?

551
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,098
Did you ever say that price?

552
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,685
No, I never asked for money...

553
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,983
Wait, actually...

554
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,530
Back when I said I would report him
if he kept forcing me to do sexual favors,

555
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,452
he asked how much I wanted,
and if 30 million Won was enough.

556
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,247
I cried, saying it wasn't about money

557
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,919
and I said even three billion Won
wouldn't cut it.

558
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,088
That's what I think I said.

559
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,258
They recorded that.

560
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,427
What the...

561
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,391
And one more thing.

562
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,603
Violation of laws
on electronic communications

563
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,439
and the protection of information.

564
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,276
It means you exposed his identity online.

565
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:14,490
They will use
Yeong-sin's article for this.

566
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,576
Identity? I never wrote his name.

567
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,537
-My article merely--
-Shut it.

568
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:21,747
Okay.

569
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,169
Hey, Cheol-min.
Print out Yeong-sin's article for me.

570
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,546
I need to look at the details.

571
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,755
Yes, sir.

572
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,054
Hello?

573
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,515
Park Bong-su, why are you calling so late?

574
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,267
Keep it down!

575
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,435
Okay.

576
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,195
Don't you have any consideration
for your superior?

577
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,365
If you're going to run,
you should tell me first.

578
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,409
I'm sorry, ma'am.

579
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,537
Why do you sound like that?

580
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,960
I was so shocked, I kept throwing up
and I barely got home and fell asleep.

581
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:14,758
Do you always throw up when you're scared?

582
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:20,931
This is so humiliating.
Look, I have a favor to ask.

583
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,019
Please don't tell anyone about this.

584
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,230
Why is that humiliating?

585
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,441
Everyone has a weakness.

586
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,486
To be honest, I'm also like that.

587
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,449
When I get scared, I can't breathe.

588
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,911
But why is that humiliating?
It's just inconvenient.

589
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,583
Bong-su? Are you still there?

590
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,835
Yes, I'm here.

591
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,671
Anyway, now that I heard your voice,
I'm good.

592
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,506
Can you make it to work tomorrow?

593
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,134
Of course.

594
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,095
Then take your time. I'll tell the chief.

595
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,432
But...

596
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,268
I feel bad too.

597
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,563
I dragged a new guy
to such a dangerous place.

598
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,776
-Anyway, good night.
-Yes, you too.

599
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,194
-Hold up.
-What?

600
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,489
I'm right. You keep talking down to me.

601
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,037
But what was that text you sent me?

602
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,540
That you just wanted to die.

603
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,626
Oh, that?

604
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,838
It's a long story.

605
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,342
Don't you need to sleep?
Is your stomach okay?

606
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,930
I'm lying down in bed, so I'm fine now.

607
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,017
You know that article I wrote?

608
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,270
It totally backfired on me.

609
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:57,736
Joo Yeon-hui, the newspaper,
and I are being sued.

610
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,868
The media is mostly on their side,
so the public will be too.

611
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,789
It's something I can't handle
like someone said.

612
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,504
Who do you mean? Reporter Kim Mun-ho?

613
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,006
Don't even mention that name to me.

614
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:23,303
-Why not?
-I swallowed my pride and called him.

615
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,890
-Kim Mun-ho?
-I said not to say his name.

616
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,479
That jerk totally changed his attitude
now that the situation has changed.

617
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,442
He's a total jerk.

618
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,735
He doesn't even deserve to be anything.

619
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,281
Is he that famous?

620
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:48,454
You work in the media industry.
How can you not know him?

621
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,538
He's that big?

622
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,670
I used to like him a lot.

623
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,257
He was my idol, my first love, and...

624
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,385
my long-term crush.

625
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:09,349
I mean, I had his poster on my wall
instead of celebrities.

626
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,686
And since last year,

627
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,688
he's one of the two guys that I like.

628
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,191
What do you mean?

629
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,236
I have a new crush on someone.

630
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,450
You are really something else.

631
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,454
So, who is the other crush?

632
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,915
Somebody. You wouldn't know
even if I told you.

633
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,625
Is he a reporter, too?

634
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,754
He's a night messenger.

635
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,594
-What?
-You've never heard of that before, right?

636
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,056
No, I haven't.

637
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,391
Anyway, he's really good.

638
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,227
He's very famous in that industry.

639
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:59,233
All I know about him are the rumors,
but you know how rumors are.

640
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,235
They are exaggerated
and blown out of proportion.

641
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:02,903
But it made...

642
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,989
my heart race.

643
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,660
And it made me wonder.

644
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,624
That's how my second crush began.

645
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:21,380
He is so mysterious and hard to see,

646
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,883
so I wonder if I would
ever get to meet him.

647
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,302
But...

648
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,388
I think...

649
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,224
I have met him.

650
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,518
You have met him?

651
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,646
That night messenger?

652
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:39,940
Yes.

653
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,150
I didn't see his face,

654
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,194
but that feeling...

655
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,033
You know, that feeling...

656
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,538
That feeling...

657
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,298
What am I saying? I have lost my mind.

658
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,593
Anyway, Bong-su, you're strange.

659
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:12,180
-Why am I strange?
-You are...

660
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,225
strangely comfortable.

661
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,854
As if...

662
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,025
we were sisters.

663
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,866
Good night. I need to go
feel uncomfortable. Later.

664
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,082
What? It feels like what?

665
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,126
Like we're sisters?

666
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,845
Did you call for me, Boss?

667
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,555
Welcome.

668
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,018
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Kim.

669
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,229
I only did what you taught me.

670
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,731
Have a seat.

671
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,366
Your usual, Mr. Kim?

672
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,035
Cognac on the rocks?

673
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,620
Thank you.

674
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,415
You know...

675
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,127
cognac is best
when you don't add anything to it.

676
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,632
You're supposed to enjoy
the aroma of cognac.

677
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,931
But this is all theoretical.

678
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,270
Nothing is more correct than my taste buds

679
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,022
and preferences.

680
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,153
Because I am the center of the universe.

681
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,697
The universe evolves around me.

682
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,366
Don't you agree?

683
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,910
I have a long way to go

684
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,288
before reaching that state.

685
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,211
Assemblyman Kim.

686
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,756
Yes, sir.

687
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,466
You know...

688
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,052
we live together in this society.

689
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:02,684
There should be lines that
we must not cross, at least.

690
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,519
I have no excuse, sir.

691
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:09,316
Do you believe that heroes can
take advantage of their sexual desires?

692
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,067
No, sir.

693
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,029
It isn't like that.

694
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,490
Mr. Kim included,

695
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:21,536
many people worked very hard to make you

696
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,414
a mayoral candidate of Seoul.

697
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,876
You can't disappoint us

698
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,796
because of some girl now,

699
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,090
can you?

700
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,598
It will never happen again.

701
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,559
It was a momentary lapse in judgment.

702
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,646
There were such high expectations of me,

703
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,106
and I became extremely stressed.

704
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,278
I am not trying to make excuses.

705
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,281
Please, sir.

706
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,285
Give me another chance.

707
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,635
I'll do it.

708
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:22,639
You can go.

709
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,392
Thank you.

710
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,490
Why do you keep getting lighter?

711
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,367
You make me nervous.

712
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,870
How are you always the same?

713
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,162
You make me feel bad.

714
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,415
Even if I annoy you, you don't show it.

715
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,750
You are not annoying. Not at all.

716
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,211
How is that possible? You're only human.

717
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,963
Don't jump to conclusions.

718
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,216
Did you take your medicine?

719
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,260
I did.

720
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,604
-Is the lighting okay?
-Yes.

721
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:14,566
Go to sleep.
I'll leave after you fall asleep.

722
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,708
Do you want me to read to you?

723
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,294
What did you do today?

724
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,213
You can't sleep?

725
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,009
I can't.

726
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,640
Today...

727
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,311
I met with some morons again.

728
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,565
Seeing those morons,

729
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,818
I wondered if it's really okay to

730
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,113
trust these utterly stupid insects

731
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,117
and utterly vulgar beings full of greed.

732
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,121
Will our country be alright
in the hands of these beings?

733
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,832
That's what I thought.

734
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,794
Kim Mun-sik.

735
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,004
You have changed a lot.

736
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,924
You just said I'm always the same.

737
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:25,470
The Kim Mun-sik in college
was timid and quiet

738
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,390
and just laughed in the background.

739
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,601
Probably.

740
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,229
But the Kim Mun-sik of today is...

741
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,651
like the man behind King Arthur,

742
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,654
Merlin, the magician, may I say?

743
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,949
Wise and cunning.

744
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,493
Full of trickery.

745
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,664
Either compliment me or insult me.
Just stick to one.

746
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,084
Mr. Kim Mun-sik.

747
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,129
Yes, ma'am?

748
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,714
Do you want to...

749
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,510
stop being Merlin, and become King Arthur?

750
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,557
You don't like it?

751
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,392
For the past 20 years,

752
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:17,814
you have climbed higher and higher
and have grown more powerful.

753
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,276
Is it still not enough?

754
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,489
-Myeong-hui.
-Yes?

755
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,326
I haven't changed since college.

756
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,789
While you shouted
and sought democracy and justice,

757
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,167
all I did was drive for you.

758
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,753
But I tried...

759
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,881
saying what's wrong is wrong.

760
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,178
I still want to say what's wrong is wrong.

761
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,556
I merely realized that...

762
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,062
in order to do that, you need power.

763
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:03,818
Okay.

764
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,154
Fine.

765
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,328
I'm sorry for questioning you.

766
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,543
Go to sleep, okay?

767
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:27,967
Go on.

768
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:48,822
Goodness, why isn't he calling? Why?

769
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,448
-Reporter Yeo.
-Yes.

770
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,909
Are you sure the chairman hasn't called?

771
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,370
No, I haven't even left
for a bathroom break.

772
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,496
I'm sure he didn't call.

773
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,997
That is strange.

774
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,583
He said he would send
a lawyer this morning.

775
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,545
He said he would send
a lawyer that he knows

776
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,838
by this morning.

777
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,925
Shouldn't we wait until 11:59 A.M. then?

778
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,844
-Why you...
-Chief!

779
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,761
What?

780
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,805
-Someone...
-Is he here? The lawyer is here?

781
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,473
No. Someone outside is--

782
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,940
Wow. He looks just like
Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

783
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,162
Chief Jang Byeong-se, I presume?

784
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,917
Yes, I am Chief Jang Byeong-se, but...

785
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:44,919
I'm Kim Mun-ho.

786
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:51,301
What brings Reporter Kim Mun-ho here...

787
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,178
I see.

788
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,307
You came all the way here
to investigate that story?

789
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,892
I look forward to working with you.

790
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,437
What?

791
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,378
You scared me.

792
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,547
You're here early. How do you feel?

793
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,049
I feel fine, ma'am.

794
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,052
You're not talking down to me.

795
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,851
Is someone moving in?

796
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,525
Is what I see here
the entire newspaper company?

797
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,695
The marketing and business teams
are over that way.

798
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,031
We do the art, editing,
and everything else here.

799
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:59,494
I know I already asked earlier,

800
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,996
but what brings you--

801
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,541
-Hello! Good morning!
-Hold on.

802
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,129
We will create a video department
for Someday News.

803
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,756
And I will run it.

804
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,841
What?

805
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,678
He's the real Reporter Kim Mun-ho.
Aren't you shocked?

806
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,640
Then we'll need a camera crew,
an editing room,

807
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,016
and more space.

808
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,144
We'll have to use another floor
in this building.

809
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,479
Excuse me, Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

810
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,816
The owner of our Someday News

811
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,402
owns this building as well, so--

812
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,444
Excuse me.

813
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,197
Hello? I'm busy, so call back...

814
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,740
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

815
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,617
Yes.

816
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,414
Pardon? Yes.

817
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,419
-Yeong-sin.
-Yes, Chief.

818
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,799
Our chairman has sold the building.

819
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,303
He sold this company too.

820
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,138
To whom?

821
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,144
I think I can use this space.

822
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,314
But we need a place
to put the video equipment.

823
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,359
Video equipment, as in cameras and such?

824
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,116
Please tell them where to put these.

825
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,744
Yes. Please come this way.

826
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,164
-This way.
-Okay.

827
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,508
-Chae Yeong-sin.
-Yes?

828
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,469
Shouldn't you be very busy right now?

829
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,262
Me?

830
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:43,890
What time is it?

831
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,435
It's 8:00 A.M...

832
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,645
That hurt.

833
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,979
Call home.

834
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,106
Tell them you won't be home
for a few days.

835
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,479
Do you know Mun-ho's first love?

836
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,233
He said this is to repay
a debt to that girl.

837
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,902
Kim Ui-chan will announce
his candidacy for mayor of Seoul.

838
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,445
I'm thinking of sending you.

839
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:40,571
I'll do it.

840
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,949
You'll stop me from meeting Kim Mun-sik?

841
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,118
Then I must meet him right now.

842
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,121
Find out if Chae Yeong-sin was adopted.

843
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,041
This client made a new job request.

844
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,086
Protect Chae Yeong-sin.

845
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,672
You like hitting people, don't you?

846
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,882
You haven't been hit much, have you?

847
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:01,634
Who are you?

848
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,886
Who am I?
