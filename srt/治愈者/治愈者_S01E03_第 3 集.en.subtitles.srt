1
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,868
My dream is...

2
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,370
to not dream.

3
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,793
That dream has been recurring
ever since that day.

4
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,340
I thought I'd forgot about it
after a few months.

5
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,137
But it always returns to me like this.

6
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,561
I committed a sin.

7
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,905
It was very windy on that rooftop
on the 25th floor.

8
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:21,075
And she was standing
on the ledge and swaying like this.

9
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,869
Her eyes had this unfocused look.

10
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:26,247
She looked like
she was about to jump, and I said...

11
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,378
"Hold on. Let's talk.

12
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,256
You want to say something, right?
I'll listen."

13
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,343
At first, I didn't think
she heard me at all.

14
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,553
But I didn't give up and kept going.

15
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,723
I wondered what I should say
to have her listen to me.

16
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,228
My head was steaming
and I blurted out something,

17
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,481
but then she started listening to me.

18
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,692
-What did you say?
-What?

19
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,864
I don't remember.
I said anything that came to mind.

20
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,242
But one of them struck a chord.

21
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,202
You know me, right?

22
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,454
I'm the genius of speech
and queen of persuasion.

23
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,751
But how long is she going to stay here?

24
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,880
I can't just send her home.
She has no family and she lives alone.

25
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,299
-Are you worried?
-Yes, I am.

26
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,598
We should keep an eye on her
for a while, right?

27
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,892
-We should keep an eye on her.
-Who will?

28
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,728
I have to go to work. I have a job.

29
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,940
-Then I have to do it?
-Yes, probably.

30
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,236
If a person decides
to do something like that,

31
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,904
you never know when they'll try again.

32
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,032
Depression is an illness.
It is not easy to cure.

33
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,784
So, we should--

34
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,286
It's hot!

35
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,831
Is it salty or bland?

36
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,170
Come have breakfast.

37
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,881
Let's have breakfast.

38
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,849
Isn't there anyone you could stay with?

39
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,435
A friend or a relative?

40
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,104
No.

41
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,446
Don't you need to stop by your place?

42
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,365
You don't need your clothes,
makeup or anything?

43
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,243
Those people
are probably staking out my place.

44
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,996
What do you mean by "those people"?

45
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,714
If you're that concerned,
shouldn't you tell the police?

46
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,554
I have a favor to ask.

47
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,270
This is all I have.

48
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,148
Please let me stay here for a while.

49
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,945
Let you stay here...

50
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:50,368
Well, you can sleep in Yeong-sin's room.

51
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,831
I can cook, so it's not a big deal, but...

52
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,793
I don't have much left in the bank,
but I'll transfer it all to you.

53
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,963
-Look, Miss...
-You're a lawyer, right?

54
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,675
Please take on my case.

55
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,816
What is with this antique?

56
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,112
SERIAL NUMBER

57
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,333
Here we go again.

58
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,879
He can't stay out of people's business
and I can't say no.

59
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,132
What is wrong with us?

60
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,221
He knows that I never let anyone
in my room.

61
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,434
I can't sleep with other people,
so I don't even go on retreats.

62
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,477
Dad is so...

63
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,691
My room.

64
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,363
My bed.

65
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:31,260
I want to be your bed
in your room for just one day

66
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,554
Oh, baby

67
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:40,436
I want to hold you warmly in my arms

68
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,730
And put you to sleep

69
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,150
Even the slightest discomfort

70
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,446
Even the monsters in my dreams

71
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:56,619
Would be eliminated by your little whisper

72
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,828
Ouch!

73
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:04,418
I am so curious to know

74
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,923
How much you love me

75
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,927
In your small drawer

76
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,789
Where's my cell phone?

77
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,007
What?

78
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,101
Clean your room!
You'll be sharing it with a guest.

79
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,645
I'll take care of it, okay?

80
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,821
Do I have everything?

81
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,468
Geez.

82
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,026
-Mun-ho, why are you here so late?
-Why?

83
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,903
The chief has been looking for you.

84
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,031
It's not looking good. You should go in.

85
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:58,991
Please...

86
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,498
"The Korean economy will fail
without Suseong Industries."

87
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,958
This is what the minister of finance said

88
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,878
at the Ministry of Strategy
and Finance meeting.

89
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:16,717
But Suseong Industries has been
under suspicion of lobbying politicians...

90
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,302
What's wrong with your face?

91
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,054
Did some woman bother you all night?

92
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,932
You better stop.
People might think you're my wife.

93
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,767
Something seems missing...

94
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,437
A written apology
won't be enough this time.

95
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,106
Fine. Do whatever you need to do.

96
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,149
Whether it's a suspension
or pay cut, I'll accept it.

97
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,984
Your brother is here.

98
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,446
What?

99
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,240
He's in the president's office.

100
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,700
Why?

101
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,203
Why are you asking me
about your own brother?

102
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,000
There's a limit to everything.

103
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,461
What?

104
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,630
Even if you have good connections
and fear nothing,

105
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,298
there is a limit.

106
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,846
Among the suspicions
surrounding Suseong Industries,

107
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,515
the biggest issue right now
is illegal gifts.

108
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,852
Our news team investigated
the illegal gifts

109
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,229
given to the family members
of Suseong Industries too.

110
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,024
But we couldn't air it during the news.

111
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,194
"It was cut out because
the investigation was incomplete."

112
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,697
That was the reason, supposedly.

113
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,034
But I have a feeling
it was because our channel airs

114
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,915
dozens of Suseong Industries' commercials
on a daily basis, which we cannot ignore.

115
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,667
Hold on, Reporter Kim Mun-ho...

116
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,503
Many recently-retired
TV stations' executives

117
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,590
transferred into
Suseong's affiliated companies.

118
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,467
That may be worth looking into--

119
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,553
What is your problem?

120
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,556
Are you rebelling
like a pubescent teenager?

121
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,100
At this age? No way.

122
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,269
Do you hate me or something?

123
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,314
You want to kick me out that badly?

124
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,901
Do you hate me for becoming a chief first?

125
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,322
-Min-jae.
-I'm your chief.

126
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,950
Yes, Chief. So, why won't you let me
report something

127
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,702
I spent three months investigating?

128
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,955
You can't go out on this program anymore.

129
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,875
No, I like this program. It's live.

130
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,836
I'm going to supervise
every story you bring myself.

131
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,923
Before you edit what you film on scene,

132
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,299
pass it by me first.

133
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,761
If you favor me like that
so blatantly, the others--

134
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,555
I would like to fire you
right this instant, but--

135
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,893
That would be wrongful termination,
and I'll sue both you and the President.

136
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,647
Stop it.

137
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:41,695
I know we can't touch the only brother
of Jeil News's owner.

138
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,700
This may be your playground,
but I worked my whole life to get here.

139
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,995
Stop fooling around.

140
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,999
Fine. I'm sorry.

141
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,002
But you...

142
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:58,963
Me what?

143
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,631
You worked your whole life to get here?

144
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,136
Sitting there and listening to what
your bosses tell you?

145
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,475
Does it make you feel better
talking like that?

146
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,270
Am I wrong?

147
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,542
What is so weird?

148
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,420
It's weird. Why would the owner
of a giant media company personally

149
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,922
come to meet with a hired president?

150
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,886
There are bars with private rooms
and that mysterious VIP club, too.

151
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,972
I booked that mysterious VIP club.

152
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,017
Make time tomorrow evening.

153
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,561
All the media company owners
will be there.

154
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,187
Mun-sik.

155
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,066
We swim in different ponds.
What's gotten into you?

156
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,359
Swim over to mine.

157
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,570
It's time for you to swim over.

158
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,158
I told your president that I need...

159
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,744
Reporter Kim Mun-ho.

160
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,080
That I want to take you to my company.

161
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,042
You want me to join your clan
or something?

162
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,376
Is that it?

163
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,422
I'm not your child.
You won't tell me to take over

164
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,883
or anything cliche like that, are you?

165
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,553
You are my child.

166
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,264
Stop being so corny.

167
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,350
Myeong-hui and I don't have kids.

168
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,645
To us, you are our son.

169
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,819
Mun-sik.

170
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,363
Yes.

171
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,323
I am not your child.

172
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,368
I am not Myeong-hui's child either.

173
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,287
-Mun-ho.
-Leave me alone.

174
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,707
If you keep bugging me, I'll rebel.

175
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,002
Hey.

176
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,131
Don't make me rebel.

177
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,374
I think Oh Seon-jeong
and Lee Jun-bin are together.

178
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,584
Reporter Lee went to speak
with the security guard.

179
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,130
Should I wait for them to come out?
Or should I ask around?

180
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,424
CHIEF

181
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:54,888
Yes, sir?

182
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,267
Did you see? You saw, didn't you?

183
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,685
You saw. She saw.

184
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,687
So, why haven't you called?

185
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,816
What? You're staking out day and night?

186
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,360
So, you have no time
to write any other stories?

187
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,361
What on earth...

188
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,487
Hey.

189
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,699
Daily Patch published it an hour ago.

190
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,535
All the reporters in Korea
are all over it now.

191
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,748
What did you do when you were
supposedly staking out all night?

192
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,419
Why aren't you answering me,
Chae Yeong-sin!

193
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,591
I'm in the elevator,
so I can't hear very well.

194
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,594
I'll have to call you back.

195
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,221
-Excuse me.
-Watch out.

196
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,765
Yes, sir.

197
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,433
Okay.

198
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,852
-Reporter Kim.
-Where is he?

199
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,737
Miss Chae.

200
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,239
You're late.

201
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,284
How can you survive
in this field if you're so slow?

202
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,502
Goodness me.

203
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,279
MS. JO

204
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,365
Why did you turn your tracker off?

205
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,699
I'm thinking about something.

206
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,159
I said not to think.

207
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,494
Where are you?

208
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,497
In front of the house of a girl
who has my picture.

209
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,623
Have you lost your mind?

210
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,627
I told you to lay low.
Stay home and don't come out.

211
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,088
How does she have my picture?

212
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,339
That isn't a picture of you.

213
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,133
It's just your clothes and hat.

214
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:59,221
Some guy hired us to get
a sample for a DNA test.

215
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,764
And we got it for him.

216
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,224
We got him her clipped nail.

217
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,268
What was the request after that?

218
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,647
Gather information on her,
so I had to watch for 24 hours.

219
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,609
In other words, I had to be
wherever she was.

220
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,695
That's what it was.

221
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,822
But I'm being wanted for murder.

222
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,407
Hold on.

223
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,744
Is she bait in order to catch me?

224
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,039
Why is such a smart guy
hanging around there?

225
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,253
Someone is trying to frame you
for Ko Seong-cheol's murder.

226
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,462
So, I'm telling you, you punk...

227
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,342
-Are you still there?
-Yes. What?

228
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,137
After killing Ko Seong-cheol,

229
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,099
it wasn't just our email address
that he left at the scene.

230
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:50,397
That jerk knew the address
of the motel you two were hiding in.

231
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,733
Who paid the motel bill?

232
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,069
I did, with cash.
You said you would reimburse me.

233
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,237
And the receipt?

234
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,822
I got rid of it, of course.

235
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,241
I ripped it in pieces
and threw it out elsewhere.

236
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,910
But somehow,

237
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:07,414
the motel receipt was found
in Ko Seong-cheol's pocket.

238
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:12,085
Wow. Whoever he is, he's pretty good. And?

239
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,963
It looks like he checked
the security cameras around the motel.

240
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:20,010
I know of one detective who is that quick.

241
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:26,433
This man next to the victim is the man
who goes by the codename Healer.

242
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,897
Our cyber team has acquired
a few other photos of him,

243
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,857
but they all look like this.

244
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,902
The quality of the security video is poor,

245
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,572
and his face is always covered by a cap,
a hood, sunglasses and so on.

246
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,910
People who even met him
can't describe his face properly.

247
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,581
Some say he's in his 20s
and others say 40s.

248
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,586
So, is he some sort of fixer?

249
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,840
He would do anything for money,
no questions asked?

250
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,094
Up to now, he has only violated
communications laws

251
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,346
and been charged with breaking
and entering.

252
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,516
His targets were very diverse.

253
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,770
From private companies
to government infrastructures--

254
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,398
Excuse me for a minute.

255
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,944
Ko Seong-cheol's autopsy report is out.

256
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,616
SUFFOCATION DUE TO POISONING BY ACONITINE

257
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,411
The cause of death is
suffocation due to poison

258
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,663
which led to nerve-paralysis.

259
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,040
Then, it's not a suicide.

260
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,753
The brain hemorrhage and spinal fracture

261
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:42,884
caused from the fall from the train
are considered post-mortem.

262
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,059
In other words,

263
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:55,063
someone killed Ko Seong-chul
by poisoning him.

264
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,233
And then threw his body from the train.

265
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,609
That's how it seems.

266
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,988
The lab results show

267
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,824
it was aconitine poisoning.

268
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,453
Even a very small dosage would

269
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,622
paralyze the lung function instantly
and be fatal.

270
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,877
You mean that Healer...

271
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,421
is also a contract killer?

272
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,131
That's how crimes work.

273
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,426
If you don't get caught, you repeat it.

274
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,221
If you keep repeating it,
the crimes worsen.

275
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,517
That's why we need to catch him soon.

276
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,655
The autopsy report is out.

277
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,408
SUFFOCATION DUE TO POISONING BY ACONITINE

278
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,494
It says he was poisoned.

279
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,995
So, who did it?

280
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,040
Someone who knew Seong-cheol
and I were at that motel.

281
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,960
Someone who was able to forge
the receipt from that motel,

282
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,756
and able to put that receipt
in Ko Seong-cheol's pocket.

283
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,257
So, who would it be?

284
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,383
You.

285
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,510
What the...

286
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:10,055
Or the guy who hired us for the job.

287
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,933
Wait. Be quiet for a minute.

288
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,392
Let me think.

289
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,022
Please pass along this message too.

290
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,068
Jeil News should have no problem

291
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,488
sending me to the states.

292
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,033
I'm sure he said "Jeil News."

293
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,910
The question is, who?

294
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,915
He wants to leave the country today.

295
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,502
But he asserts
that he'll be caught at the airport

296
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,254
if he uses his real name.

297
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,048
So...

298
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,217
Yes.

299
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,010
Yes.

300
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,765
They will get you a new passport.

301
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,809
But leaving by air is still dangerous

302
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,270
so they'll prepare for you
to take a boat from Busan.

303
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,856
Which means you need
to get to Busan first.

304
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,023
Is that okay?

305
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,989
He agreed.

306
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,116
How can he get his passport?

307
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,885
DESTINATION: BUSAN

308
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,957
I had a bad feeling about it.

309
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,168
I thought for about a second

310
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,462
whether I should get
on that train with him.

311
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,297
That isn't right.

312
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,466
Ko Seong-cheol is B.

313
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,010
The person who paid us is A.

314
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,889
We must always stick to what A requests.

315
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,017
We take or give as instructed.

316
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,185
Then it's over.

317
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,605
But that A got me involved in this mess.

318
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,649
I'm framed for poisoning a man to death.

319
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,151
But why would you use poison
to kill someone?

320
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,486
That's just annoying.

321
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,447
I'm ordering you as your boss.
Get out of there now.

322
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,866
And what? Run for the rest of my life?

323
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,326
Take the blame for a murder?

324
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,036
If not, then what?

325
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,038
I need to catch the real killer.

326
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,749
I can't trust the police.

327
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,169
I'll catch him myself
and hand him over to the police, so...

328
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,972
-Is that him?
-Who? What?

329
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,558
Hey, Healer?

330
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,102
I wanted to know...

331
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,065
who was spending so much money
to find this girl.

332
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,610
Whether he is just a client,

333
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,238
or he's using bait to catch me.

334
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,168
01 A 6587

335
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,004
Track this car down for me.

336
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,433
Find out about this guy too.

337
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,019
But I think...

338
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,106
I've seen that face somewhere before.

339
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,288
TODAY'S MENU

340
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,795
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

341
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,722
What? That's Kim Mun-ho.

342
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,223
Don't you know Kim Mun-ho?

343
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:23,850
Kim Mun-ho?

344
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,393
Who is that?

345
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,146
He's a reporter. A big shot reporter.

346
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,481
Don't you watch...

347
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,441
Right, You don't watch the news.

348
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,984
But...

349
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,820
-what is this?
-What?

350
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,658
It says he is the brother
of the owner of Jeil News.

351
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,204
So, what is going on here?

352
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:46,915
Okay.

353
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,253
Enough thinking.
The next step is to take action.

354
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,880
Action? Where are you going?

355
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,757
Hey! Healer!

356
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,180
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

357
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,981
LAW OFFICE OF CHAE CHI-SU

358
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,747
She is Ji-an.

359
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,418
Ji-an, Uncle Mun-ho is here.

360
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,380
When will you grow up and call him Uncle?

361
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,397
Isn't she pretty?

362
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,734
Yes, she's pretty.

363
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,155
Your daughter grew up to be very pretty.

364
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,205
That looked suspicious, very suspicious.

365
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,290
What do you mean?

366
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,709
Mister.

367
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,545
The back of my head keeps tingling lately.

368
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,672
It feels like I'm being followed.

369
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,591
By who? A guy?

370
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,426
Is it a guy?

371
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,095
Really? Is it a guy?

372
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,184
Why doesn't he just come out
and say that he likes me?

373
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,812
It's not like he can fight back
his feelings.

374
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,064
How would you know?

375
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,274
How would you know that feeling?

376
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,984
It's not like you have experienced it.

377
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,654
Mister.

378
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,449
I'm a veteran entertainment reporter.
I do know.

379
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,538
That doesn't make you
an expert of relationships.

380
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,415
They are all in the same category and--

381
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,333
Yeong-sin.

382
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,379
Whatever.

383
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,955
There's a speed bump ahead.

384
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,403
He's at the intersection.

385
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,614
I think he's headed
toward the subway station.

386
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,240
Your ten o'clock.

387
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,250
Excuse me.

388
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,809
Where is he?

389
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,628
I'm at exit three. Where are you?

390
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,591
-I can give you a ride.
-One.

391
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,511
My Benny's throttle is a bit sensitive.

392
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,722
-Two.
-So, go easy on her...

393
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,306
when you ride--

394
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,558
I'm off.

395
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,775
From what I heard,
this is what's going on.

396
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,651
Here is...

397
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,571
President Hwang, a general contractor.

398
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,115
He is a broker who introduces

399
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,492
women to the men.

400
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,452
-And--
-Hold on.

401
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,496
I'm a reporter after all.

402
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,999
I lost my exclusive that I'd been
working my butt off for

403
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,375
while pretending to be nice.

404
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,463
So, if I hear something right now,
I may write it and sell the story.

405
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,506
Be careful.

406
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,466
Can you write the story?

407
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,136
-What?
-Can you write the story once you hear it?

408
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,558
Well...

409
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,562
I'm not familiar with social news,
since I'm an entertainment reporter.

410
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,107
I can't just write up anything.

411
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,860
Hey, this woman is a celebrity.

412
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,278
What?

413
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,115
I'm an actress.

414
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,119
I was in a few movies,
and a few dramas as well.

415
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,497
They were minor roles,
so you may not know me.

416
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,582
I see.

417
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,294
Listen.

418
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,257
You see here? That President Hwang guy

419
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,553
gathers up young,
helpless actresses like her, and...

420
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,224
makes them do sexual favors
for rich and powerful men.

421
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,394
Sexual exploitation is so common now...

422
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,233
At first,

423
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,652
they were drugged and forced to do it.

424
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,364
Then they continued to force them
by blackmailing them.

425
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,325
For example,
they'll release videos and such.

426
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,536
Can you write up such a story?

427
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,999
But wouldn't it be better
to go to the police?

428
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:08,916
I did.

429
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,587
I reported it to the police.

430
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,923
-But?
-They said I had no proof.

431
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,717
No proof...

432
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,095
that I was forced to do such things.

433
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,014
What?

434
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,433
You go to the police
so they can find the evidence.

435
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,268
They want the victim
to bring the evidence?

436
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,311
Exactly.

437
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,813
And President Hwang said

438
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,234
it would be a piece of cake
to make me disappear.

439
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,406
But he's letting me live because
that man is looking for me.

440
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,244
That I should be good to that man
and do as he says.

441
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,373
That I can't even die
until that man gets sick of me.

442
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,544
-"That man"?
-That's the problem.

443
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,546
Here.

444
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,343
This man.

445
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,721
One of the top assemblymen
of the ruling party.

446
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,265
Favored to be the next mayor of Seoul.

447
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,231
Assemblyman Kim Ui-chan? My goodness.

448
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,274
This is pretty tough, right?

449
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:20,363
Dad, we're low
on the totem pole even among

450
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,907
B-rated online entertainment news sites.
This is...

451
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,662
I'm going to resubmit
the complaint as her lawyer.

452
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,500
I'll charge this President Hwang guy

453
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,043
for accessory to rape.

454
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,588
If he forced sexual favors
for a specific benefit,

455
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,923
we'll add on bribery.

456
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,635
And the recipient of the sexual favors...

457
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,764
For him, it will be for receiving bribes.

458
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:51,143
I thought the police wouldn't investigate
because of a lack of evidence.

459
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,814
That's their way of trying
to bury this, so how--

460
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,774
That is why we need a story in the paper.

461
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,901
There needs to be buzz in the media.

462
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,153
That is the only way
they'll do their job properly.

463
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,240
The online community
is the scariest, you know.

464
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,917
The leader of the ruling party.

465
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,964
It's the ruling party, Dad.
This is really tough.

466
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,383
Hey, Yeong-sin.

467
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,137
You said your dream
was not to be a tabloid reporter.

468
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,724
You said you wanted to be a real reporter.

469
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,812
A real...

470
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,564
What brings you here at this hour?

471
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,817
Is something wrong?

472
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,154
It took an hour and 40 minutes.

473
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,781
What did?

474
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,202
It's only an hour
and 40 minutes between there

475
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,954
and here.

476
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,164
What are you talking about?
You're so random.

477
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,460
You didn't drive after drinking, did you?

478
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,550
You're acting strange. What is it?

479
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,474
Let's go in.
I think it's going to rain. It's dreary.

480
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,235
It won't be easy.

481
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:46,378
I know because I have watched my dad work
since I was little.

482
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,341
Cases like this are not easy.

483
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,220
Everything about you might be revealed.

484
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,766
You may have to give up
your acting career.

485
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,476
I know.

486
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,730
Everything from pressing charges
to going to trials...

487
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,649
It will get really dirty.

488
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,361
They may paint you as a temptress
in it for the money.

489
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,321
That's fine.

490
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,241
You're brave.

491
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,576
I was wrong...

492
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,540
when I wanted to kill myself on that roof.

493
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,626
Of course you were wrong. So--

494
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,254
I'll regret it if I die alone.

495
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,213
Yes...

496
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,090
What?

497
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,676
There are other people who deserve to die.

498
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,804
It's true.

499
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,431
There are people who need
to disappear from this world.

500
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:44,061
Only then, the world
will become a better place.

501
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,022
I will take...

502
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,359
some of those jerks with me.

503
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,321
I won't go alone.

504
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,242
So...

505
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,078
if you're scared, you can stop now.

506
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,163
Don't help me.

507
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,213
You sounded so cool right now.

508
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,756
My heart skipped a beat.

509
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,806
I believe in things like that.

510
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,518
Fate, destiny, stuff like that.

511
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:30,107
If they didn't exist, why would we have
words for them in the first place?

512
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,446
So, even if I want to run away,
it's too late.

513
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,700
We have met, so our lives are entwined now

514
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,037
and our destiny has begun.

515
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,676
-Ms. Jo.
-What?

516
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,304
What is it?

517
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,057
You know...

518
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,352
for as long as I could remember,

519
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,647
my life was just bland.

520
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,566
What are you talking about?

521
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,069
Nothing was fun or interesting.

522
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,447
I lived because I felt obliged to.

523
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,824
That's how I have lived.

524
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,870
Every day seemed like homework.

525
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,329
What's wrong with you?

526
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,415
What is it? Turn the camera on.

527
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:52,958
But...

528
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,670
I think...

529
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,423
it's about to...

530
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,342
get interesting.

531
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,871
My heart...

532
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,626
is tickling all over.

533
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,505
This is the first time I felt this way.

534
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,652
I'm the CEO of SS Guard, Bae Sang-su.

535
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,237
Mr. Bae.

536
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,115
Right. Okay.

537
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,910
My boss would like
to have an information team.

538
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,121
Isn't that why you called us?

539
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:58,333
Well, we are the best in Korea
beyond comparison.

540
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,793
We at SS...

541
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,920
By the way, those are my initials.

542
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:06,508
Sang-su. SS. Double S.

543
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,803
I heard you have taken on jobs
from many companies.

544
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,807
We have done unofficial jobs
for the country too.

545
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,977
Have you ever met the owners
of those companies?

546
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,776
We normally work with the teams
out in the field.

547
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,533
My boss is in this car.

548
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,494
The boss...

549
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:40,334
Would you like to get in
and meet him yourself?

550
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,879
Well, I would be honored.

551
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,798
But if you do, the person in that car...

552
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,093
will become your boss as well.

553
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:54,890
Goodness.

554
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,353
I don't like that term, "boss."

555
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,271
Then I'll rephrase the term.

556
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,650
He wishes to buy your company.

557
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:08,904
Well...

558
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:13,408
It's not just you that want my company.

559
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,452
There was one. Daewon Group.

560
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,954
They offered 2.2 billion won.

561
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,124
We will pay you double.

562
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:26,963
The money will be deposited
to your personal account tomorrow morning.

563
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,927
You can continue operating SS Guard
as you always have.

564
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,681
Nothing will change on the surface.

565
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:42,104
The only difference is that you,
the CEO, will belong to my boss.

566
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,527
"Belong"? What does that mean?

567
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,779
You would sell your soul.

568
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,572
My soul...

569
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,125
Would you like to meet the boss?

570
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,977
You said you would deposit
the money tomorrow?

571
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,528
It is nice to meet you.

572
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,621
Hello. Please excuse me.

573
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,195
Good morning, Chief.

574
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,824
I'm sorry about the Lee Jun-bin
and Oh Seon-jeong matter.

575
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,076
I have no excuse. I'm sorry, sir.

576
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,120
-Chae Yeong-sin.
-But...

577
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:27,375
how long must we tail celebrities
or rummage through the scenes of affairs?

578
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,544
We are Someday. So...

579
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,005
I have brought an exclusive.

580
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,133
It's a gigantic tsunami
that can sweep and shake

581
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,302
politics, economics
and entertainment in our country.

582
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,221
Stop talking for a minute.

583
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,889
I wasn't just bumming around.

584
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,557
I was working to snag something

585
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,726
-this big--
-Will you shut your mouth?

586
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,686
Yes, but please read this--

587
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,771
-Say hi.
-Once you do--

588
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:51,024
Say hi. Hey, you. Yes, you.

589
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,901
-Yes?
-What was your name again?

590
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,114
My name is Park Bong-su.

591
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,491
It's Park Bong-su.

592
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,743
Park Bong-su.

593
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,161
Who is he?

594
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,914
Your junior assistant,
whom you've been begging for. Happy?

595
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,417
What? I thought the company had no money?

596
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,711
You said no bonuses,
and even our salaries were iffy.

597
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,547
How can you hire a new...

598
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,632
Three million won.

599
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,637
He brought in a three million
won-a-month advertisement for a year.

600
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,851
He isn't like someone who just sits
and can't even write simple stories.

601
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,811
Yes.

602
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,355
Three million won a month
for a whole year?

603
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,367
Don't be scared.

604
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,370
Don't be nervous.
I'm your direct superior.

605
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:48,415
You can just call me "ma'am"
with lots of respect.

606
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,749
-Yes, ma'am.
-Just like that.

607
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,127
Okay, so anyway, Chief,
please take a look.

608
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,462
This is a diversion tactic, isn't it?

609
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,215
You're distracting me
after losing the exclusive.

610
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,136
Just read it, then you'll see what I mean.

611
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,513
I have a feeling once I read it,
I'll be fuming.

612
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,515
No, you won't, so just read it.

613
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,100
Your eyes will be opened and--

614
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,810
-Go!
-Wait, so--

615
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,521
This is the pantry.
You have never seen one, have you?

616
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,439
No.

617
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,733
Here, everyone from the chief
to the new guy

618
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,193
makes their own coffee. It's self-service.

619
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,863
So, don't overreact like
making coffee for others.

620
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:25,076
And here, inside the refrigerator
are many things to eat.

621
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,621
-But they have name tags on them.
-Yes.

622
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,665
This says, "Seon-jae's. Don't touch."

623
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,709
So, don't ever touch them.

624
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,711
"Don't ever touch..."

625
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,923
It's pretty good.

626
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,137
Here is our hopes and our dreams.
Reporter Yeo.

627
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,599
Although he looks like a girl,
he's a very manly reporter.

628
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:52,145
Not only does he write
the most articles here,

629
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:56,149
he does the art, marketing, advertising,
accounting, and everything.

630
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:59,736
Without him,
Someday would shut down immediately.

631
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,282
She is Reporter Noh Seon-jae.

632
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,076
Nice to meet you.

633
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,954
Yes, nice to meet you.

634
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:13,041
-Do you know something?
-Pardon? What?

635
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,542
That you're good-looking.

636
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,132
-I think so...
-Anyway.

637
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,385
Here, he is...

638
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,053
I'm Park Chan-yeong.

639
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,640
So, you're Reporter Park Chan-yeong.

640
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:29,557
I'm sorry?

641
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,727
You worthless piece of scrap.
Are you going to do that again?

642
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,145
What did I do?

643
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,316
I was busy and didn't come in
for a few days

644
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:42,195
and you print an article
without even proofreading it?

645
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:44,698
-Hey!
-I did proofread it.

646
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,741
You did? You call that proofreading?

647
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,327
Then, how were there three typos
in one story?

648
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,706
What? You proofread it? Tell me where.

649
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,083
You call yourself
an entertainment reporter?

650
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,504
-What is that?
-Pardon? What?

651
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,716
The thing in your ear. What is that?

652
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,554
This...

653
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,056
Well, this is...

654
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,643
It's sort of like a hearing aid.

655
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,521
A hearing aid?

656
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:22,068
Yes, it's for people
who can't hear very well.

657
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,446
So, in my situation,
I can hear well without it.

658
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:27,657
And sometimes when I put it in,
I can't hear...

659
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,743
So, what I mean is, this is...

660
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,869
Park Bong-su.

661
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,580
Yes? I hear you.

662
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,917
Hang in there, okay?

663
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,338
Thank you. I'll try my best.

664
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,976
The leader of the ruling party.

665
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:01,024
It's the ruling party, Dad.
This is really tough.

666
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,485
Hey, Yeong-sin.

667
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,363
You said your dream
was not to be a tabloid reporter.

668
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,700
You said you wanted to be a real reporter.

669
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:21,669
Mun-sik.

670
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,217
Mun-sik.

671
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,682
Aren't you going in?

672
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,229
CHOI MYEONG-HUI

673
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,277
You said you couldn't make it.

674
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,446
Mun-ho wouldn't stop winning.

675
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,990
Of course, Mun-ho should come.
He's her uncle.

676
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,583
Did you bring it?

677
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,504
You're the best.

678
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,553
You did great, Honey.

679
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,346
Thank you.

680
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,515
I love you.

681
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:20,061
Whatever. Mun-sik brought it
and you take the credit?

682
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,522
I had no time to go buy flowers.

683
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,066
I was going crazy outside
the delivery room.

684
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,610
You kept screaming so much,

685
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,947
I almost ran in and strangled the doctor.

686
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,581
Thanks.

687
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,429
She is Ji-an. Isn't she pretty?

688
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,036
What's your name again?

689
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,955
I'm Park Bong-su.

690
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,459
-Park Bong-su? Bong-su?
-Yes.

691
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,338
What a friendly name. But...

692
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,475
Have we met before?

693
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,396
I doubt it.

694
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,899
It's the first time.

695
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,363
-Right?
-Yes.

696
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,322
Right?

697
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:59,494
I was born with some natural
reporter's skills.

698
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,703
I was born to be a reporter.

699
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,873
The first is my verbal skills.

700
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,792
The second is my memory.

701
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,337
Once I see a face, I never forget it.

702
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,755
I see.

703
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,591
"I see"?

704
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,388
Yes, ma'am, Miss Chae.

705
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,056
Without the "Miss Chae."

706
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,975
You don't say that among reporters.

707
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,226
No. Just...

708
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,645
Ma'am.

709
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,522
Exactly.

710
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,650
Lunch is on me. Let's go.

711
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,168
I can tell just by looking at you.

712
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,670
You were a loner in school, weren't you?

713
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,088
And an adviser in the army.

714
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,717
You're so clumsy that I doubt
you were any good at interviews.

715
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,429
So that's why your parents
used all their money to

716
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,930
get you a job even in a place like this.

717
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,516
Come here. I'll take care of you
from now on.

718
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,560
My heart aches for your parents.

719
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,320
Parents can never control
how your child turns out.

720
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,670
My dream is...

721
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,340
to not dream.

722
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:39,719
That dream has been recurring
ever since that day.

723
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,846
That's when you have to capture...

724
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,682
I thought I'd forgot about it
after a few months.

725
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:49,187
But it always returns to me like this.

726
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,248
I committed a sin.

727
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,293
The name of that sin is...

728
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,338
silence.

729
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:19,759
It's very sunny today.

730
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,720
Although it feels like winter.

731
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,417
Mun-ho.

732
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,335
Ji-an must like you.

733
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,212
Give her a kiss.

734
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,427
Go on.

735
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,012
Today is Ji-an's very first day
in this world.

736
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,641
You remember the kiss
from your first day forever.

737
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,045
So? Do I look like
Reporter Park Bong-su now?

738
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,255
Bong-suk.

739
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,550
That woman, Chae Yeong-sin
is really a bait for me.

740
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,010
Let's go cause some trouble.

741
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,720
Something only human beings can do.

742
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,180
Reporter Chae Yeong-sin.

743
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:30,598
I'm your fan.

744
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,100
Can I talk to you about that?

745
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,393
About Ji-an?

746
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,521
It will be forgotten in a day.

747
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,272
Who is that reporter again?

748
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,900
I can't sleep when someone
is in the same room.

749
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,028
The fish is definitely nibbling.
