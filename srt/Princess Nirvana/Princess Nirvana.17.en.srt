Episode 17

5
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,680
I'm sorry for having not

6
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,480
welcomed you outside.

7
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,878
Please forgive me.

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,599
Uncle, greetings.

9
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,359
Leave us.

10
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,400
Yes.

11
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,280
Uncle.

12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,359
Please sit.

13
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,280
Check it out.

14
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,199
Prince Changning didn't die of illness.

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,680
Zhao Qing, the Seventh Prince,

16
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,680
tried to take the military power through the marriage

17
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,359
and was found out by the princess,

18
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,439
so he poisoned her with a nasty poison,

19
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,359
Top Red.

20
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,040
The proof

21
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,079
is right in his study.

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,480
I risked my life to write this letter to you.

23
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,519
Please

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,199
make your decision.

25
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,439
Ji Bohuai?

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,639
And this

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,360
was taken

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,840
from the Seventh Prince's mansion.

29
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,520
It's the testimony of Liang, the deceased physician.

30
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,960
How did you get this letter?

31
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,679
Uncle, you know

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,080
how loyal Ji Bohuai was to the Seventh Prince,

33
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,478
but he was hunted by Zhao Qing because he knew

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,639
the truth of Chu Ziqian's death

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,199
so he came to me

36
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,280
and begged me to take it here and tell you the truth.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,560
I thought Qian died of illness.

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,840
To think it was because of the poison.

39
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,719
Zhao Qing.

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,800
How dared you lie to me?

41
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,799
Zhao Qing

42
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,800
is a brutal

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
and treacherous man.

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm afraid that the physician Liang

45
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,198
was also killed by him.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,800
I have read the letter.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,240
Thank you for sending it.

48
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,039
Since the letter is delivered,

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,919
I am

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,280
taking my leave.

51
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,559
All right.

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,159
Uncle.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,719
Zhao Qing is a royal prince,

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,879
so don't take actions

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,400
recklessly.

56
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,159
Understood.

57
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,359
Thank you.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,759
My Lord.

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
Where's Zhao Qing?

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,599
Bring him here.

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,479
Lord.

62
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,520
His Highness is discussing the business with the Eldest Prince

63
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,439
and hasn't returned.

64
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,399
Then I'll wait for him here.

65
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,239
Linglong.

66
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,199
Lady.

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,319
You're awake.

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Why are you sweating?

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,920
I walked in a hurry

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,399
when I heard your summoning.

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Step aside.

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Hold on, my Lord.

73
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,800
How dare you stop me?

74
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,480
What's that noise outside?

75
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,120
Lord.

76
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,920
You can't enter.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
I can go anywhere as I want.

78
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,600
Don't stop me, or I will kill you.

79
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,560
What's going on outside?

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,759
Lord.

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,199
His Highness isn't here.

82
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,399
Lord.

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
Greetings, my Lord.

84
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,800
It's my father.

85
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,959
Why did he come here?

86
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,079
Why is he so angry?

87
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,560
Out of my way.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,439
I'm no longer Qian to father.

89
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
So I shall watch what he will do.

90
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,360
The study is His Highness's private space.

91
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,560
If you break in,

92
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,959
I can't explain it to him.

93
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,720
So please go easy on me.

94
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,639
I can even enter His Majesty's study freely,

95
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,839
how dare this small mansion stop me?

96
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,000
Please forgive me.

97
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,480
Why...

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,560
don't you wait for His Highness?

99
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,959
Wait?

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,800
Will I get what I want if he comes back?

101
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,439
- Lord. - Lord.

102
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,560
Welcome back, Your Highness.

103
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,639
Your Highness.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,759
Bastard.

105
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:38,719
You...

106
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
Laifeng, Laifu.

107
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know what I have done

108
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,199
to make you so mad, Uncle.

109
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,879
Zhao Qing.

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,839
They all think that you loved my daughter deeply,

111
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,720
to think

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,600
they are so wrong.

113
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,040
What are you talking about?

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,120
I don't understand.

115
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,399
Ji Bohuai told me all that you did.

116
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,639
Now I know

117
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,199
that you didn't refuse to marry Qian,

118
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,439
but also poisoned her.

119
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,560
How could you do that?

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,720
Uncle.

121
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,720
There must be some misunderstanding.

122
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,920
I haven't seen Ji for many days.

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,439
I can clear my name

124
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,000
when I find him.

125
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,680
It's the poison I found in your study.

126
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,199
The proof is solid.

127
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,600
What else can you say?

128
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,480
I swear I'm set up.

129
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,639
Don't trust those scheming people.

130
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,959
Still lying?

131
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,319
Die.

132
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,720
Take it easy.

133
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,040
Yan.

134
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,519
Do you know the consequence of killing a royal prince?

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,319
My clan will be wiped out,

136
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,680
what's the big deal?

137
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,079
I have no concerns

138
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,839
since Qian passed away.

139
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,439
I'll have no regrets if I can

140
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,680
avenge her.

141
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,439
Uncle.

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,759
I've told Ji

143
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,040
to look into Qian's death secretly

144
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,680
and I'm sure we'll know the truth

145
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,000
when he comes back.

146
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,759
Don't try to lie to me again.

147
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,319
Go to apologize to Qian in the underworld.

148
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Would Prince Changning risk her whole clan's life to take revenge?

149
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,160
Silence,

150
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
or I'll kill you, too.

151
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
Is this really what she wants?

152
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,199
Yan.

153
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,360
Uncle.

154
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm the same age of Prince Changning.

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,000
If I were dead one day,

156
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,879
I wouldn't want my family

157
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,600
to live in agony and grief.

158
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,240
Nor would I let my whole clan

159
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,120
be executed for it.

160
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,159
I will not have peace in the underworld.

161
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,200
Qian?

162
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,919
Father.

163
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,919
It will be my largest comfort to see you live well.

164
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,519
There are many doubts about the case.

165
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,199
Besides,

166
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,079
if Qing really did it,

167
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,960
why didn't he ruin the poison

168
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,159
instead of keeping it to be found?

169
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,200
Please give me more time.

170
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,759
I will find the truth.

171
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,039
If Qing was really part of it,

172
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,840
I won't stop you again.

173
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,879
Qian.

174
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
My Qian.

175
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,840
Father.

176
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
Qian.

177
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,679
I miss my Qian.
