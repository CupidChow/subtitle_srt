Episode 9

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,480
Take them to the front.

6
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,870
And that case.

7
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,680
Take that case away.

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,870
The case should be placed here.

9
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,760
Here.

10
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,560
What are you doing early in the morning?

11
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,280
Lady.

12
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,480
I'm so sorry.

13
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,510
Be quiet when you work.

14
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,870
Lady.

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,040
Did we

16
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,640
disturb you?

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,640
I am disturbed.

18
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,560
What are you doing so early?

19
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,560
A disaster befell Linzhou,

20
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,070
so His Majesty ordered His Highness

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,040
to go there

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,510
for disaster relief.

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,680
We are packing up

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,350
for his journey.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
Please forgive us

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,150
for disturbing your rest.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,510
He's leaving for Linzhou?

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,480
When?

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,040
In four hours.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,790
In such a hurry?

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,950
Thank Heaven.

32
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,039
Zhao Qing.

33
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,000
You are so dead this time.

34
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,870
Where is His Highness now?

35
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,280
Now?

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,840
He should be in his study.

37
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,400
You are going to Linzhou?

38
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,910
Yan?

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,430
Father ordered me

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,840
to check the disaster there,

41
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,190
since you were sleeping,

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,240
I was going to tell you later.

43
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,430
When do you depart?

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,960
I'll go pack up.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,870
Darling,

46
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,800
are you going with me?

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,240
You don't want me to do so?

48
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
Don't mistake it.

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm doing this

50
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,310
by the edict,

51
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,840
so it's not site seeing.

52
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,470
I'm afraid

53
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,079
you may not endure it.

54
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,400
But how could I let you go alone

55
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,840
without worrying about you?

56
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,470
Very well.

57
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,750
Then

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
we go together.

59
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,250
You...

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,510
Darling?

61
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,599
Darling?

62
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,360
What's wrong?

63
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,240
Darling,

64
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,800
are you feeling unwell?

65
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
Let me take care of you on the way.

66
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,310
No.

67
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,830
You just wait here for my return.

68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,190
His Highness can look after me.

69
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,120
Darling.

70
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,000
Shall we?

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,040
Yes.

72
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,719
Your Highness.

73
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,510
It rained last night,

74
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
so the road is muddy

75
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,680
and bumpy.

76
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,950
So take care of yourselves.

77
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:20,870
Darling.

78
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,070
You don't feel well?

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
I'm fine.

80
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,920
Laifeng.

81
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,800
Can't you drive well?

82
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,870
Your Highness.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm terribly sorry.

84
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,070
There are too many gravels on the way.

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,120
Why don't you

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,310
hold each other tightly?

87
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Can you drive or not?

88
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,870
Why are you carrying a dagger?

89
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,599
This dagger

90
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,270
is used

91
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,120
to peel apple for you.

92
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,000
Are you going

93
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,360
to use that

94
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,719
to kill me?

95
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,510
How's that possible?

96
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,160
You are thinking wildly.

97
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,390
Take it easy.

98
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,120
I'm kidding.

99
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,160
I know you are kidding of course.

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,950
So funny.
