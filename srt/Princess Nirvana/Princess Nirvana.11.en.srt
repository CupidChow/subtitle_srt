Episode 11

5
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,000
The Seventh Prince has arrived.

6
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,639
Your Highness.

7
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,040
It must be a hard journey for you.

8
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:19,719
Please.

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
Come on in and take a seat.

10
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,040
So this must be

11
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,079
your wife.

12
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,480
You have exceptional beauty.

13
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,439
Magistrate.

14
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,439
So far as I know,

15
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,000
the money and grains for disaster relief

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,959
were sent here already,

17
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,518
then why the number of the disaster victims

18
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,480
are

19
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,000
still increasing here?

20
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,159
Your Highness.

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,799
You have no idea about it.

22
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,959
The money and the grains

23
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,280
were snatched by the bandits.

24
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,640
It took us enormous effort

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,840
to get back a small part of it merely.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,039
So it's not enough for the people.

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,120
Indeed?

28
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,799
Your Highness.

29
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,400
My belly

30
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,560
is a bit hurt.

31
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,280
I'd like

32
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,559
to...

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,840
Magistrate.

34
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,879
Why didn't we

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
see any bandits on the way?

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,919
Well...

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,479
When we were robbed,

38
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,359
His Lordship

39
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,680
assembled the soldiers of Linzhou

40
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,560
and

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,919
destroyed their lair,

42
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,918
so you could

43
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,039
arrive here safe.

44
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,799
It's a shame

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,919
there was not much left

46
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
of the money and the grains.

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,560
Yes.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
The bandits

49
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,960
sent those things to another place,

50
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,079
so we got few left.

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,120
Guards.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,599
Assassin.

53
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,599
He took that direction.

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,080
Go.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,319
Go catch the assassin.

56
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,920
The bandits

57
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,199
sent them to another place,

58
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,639
so we got few left.

59
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,360
Right.

60
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,560
Where

61
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,040
are the bandits now?

62
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
They all died.

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,240
Died?

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,000
You killed them all

65
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,720
before finding the things they snatched?

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,279
We didn't have a choice

67
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,000
because they refused to surrender

68
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,439
and slandered the officials instead.

69
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,720
Your Highness.

70
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm a bit tired.

71
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,480
All right.

72
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,279
So much for today.

73
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,160
Linzhou is in disaster

74
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,199
and is in chaos.

75
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,439
It may be dangerous for you

76
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,639
to live outside.

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,759
I have prepared a good chamber

78
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,319
for you here.

79
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,839
So if you don't mind,

80
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,199
you may go to rest now.

81
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,439
All right.

82
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you for the arrangement.

83
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,360
Servants.

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,439
Take His Highness to rest.

85
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,800
It's hard

86
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,959
to deal with this prince.

87
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,800
Keep a close eye on him.

88
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,720
Yes.

89
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,199
Hey.

90
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,439
Hey.

91
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
Hey.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
They were all the people here

93
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,360
who borrowed grains and money

94
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
from the magistrate because of the disaster.

95
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,000
Then the magistrate

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
took advantage of that

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,160
to ask them for a high interest

98
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,079
and locked them up

99
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,319
when they couldn't repay him.

100
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,120
They will either be sold out

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
as prostitutes or servants.

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,319
The magistrate of Linzhou

103
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,920
is such a an animal.

104
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,040
So we need to find out

105
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,399
where the silver is

106
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,319
before

107
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,319
more people suffer from it.

108
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,360
I didn't take actions

109
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,439
in case the magistrate

110
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,879
would be alarmed.

111
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,720
They should still

112
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
be hiding in that deserted house.

113
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,000
Your Highness.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,639
According to the well-informed sources,

115
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,360
no silver was snatched by the bandits.
