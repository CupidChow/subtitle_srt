Episode 10

5
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:27,719
Halt.

6
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,599
Halt.

7
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,560
Easy. Your Highness.

8
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,200
Your Highness.

9
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,400
Be careful.

10
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,239
Easy, lady.

11
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,920
Master.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,959
Please.

13
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,599
The kids haven't eaten for three days.

14
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,640
They are starving.

15
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,559
Could you give me something to eat?

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,879
Master.

17
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,200
Laifeng, Laifu.

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,759
Take the food from the carriage.

19
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:09,919
Yes.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,800
Let's go.

21
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,879
Calm down.

22
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,680
Just calm down.

23
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,679
Pretty lady.

24
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,359
Please save my mother.

25
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,599
She's dying.

26
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,478
What's your name?

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,199
I am Xiu'er.

28
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,280
Thank you, pretty lady.

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Take your turns.

30
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,759
You'll all have it.

31
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,840
Where is your mother?

32
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,198
Take me to her.

33
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,080
Maybe

34
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,560
we can cure her.

35
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:41,759
Laifeng.

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,560
Go to Xiu's home with my wife.

37
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,679
Yes.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,719
Let's go.

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,400
Laifu.

40
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,759
Look for a hotel

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,199
to place our stuff.

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,080
All right.

43
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,120
Let's go.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
Qian?

45
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,679
Your Highness.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,520
Be patient.

47
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,399
Drink some water.

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,960
Her Ladyship will be back soon.

49
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,039
Laifeng is with her, after all.

50
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,599
Your Highness.

51
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,759
We are back.

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,759
Your Highness.

53
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,080
We are back.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,360
Darling.

55
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,719
Xiu'er?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
We were late.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,560
Mother.

58
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,680
Mother.

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,520
Xiu'er.

60
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,919
Let her go.

61
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,360
Mother.

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm going with you.

63
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,439
Aunt Mei.

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,479
Let me go with my mother.

65
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
Your mother has to be buried.

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,639
Stand up.

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
Xiu'er.

68
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,160
Don't worry.

69
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,560
I will take care of you.

70
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,040
Go.

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,759
Let your mother leave in peace.

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,319
Xiu'er.

73
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,519
Is there anyone else

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,839
who can take care of you?

75
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,920
My father went

76
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,439
to beg the magistrate to help the people,

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
then

78
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,079
he didn't come back.

79
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,519
Damn.

80
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,480
Xiu'er is such a pitiful girl.

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,519
We need to find her a good place to settle down.

82
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,040
If we don't eradicate the cause of it,

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,879
there will be more and more pitiful people

84
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,199
like Xiu'er.

85
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:27,959
Your Highness.

86
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,079
The magistrate knew

87
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,160
your arrival

88
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,160
and sent the invitation.

89
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,399
To think he knew it so soon.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,639
Someone must have let out the message.

91
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,680
So this Yue Anyang

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
is up to something.

93
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,160
I will go to see him alone.

94
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,120
Darling,

95
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,360
you don't have to go with me.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Yes,

97
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,079
I have to.

98
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,759
You may be in danger tomorrow.

99
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,519
So I must go.

100
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:00,759
Think about it,

101
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,639
since Yue Anyang took the initiative to send the invitation,

102
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
he must be well-prepared.

103
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,399
Besides,

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,959
you will be obstructed

105
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,480
if you want to check something,

106
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,360
so I think...

107
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,160
Tomorrow...

108
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,279
No.

109
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,040
I can't let you take the risk.

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,720
Do you have a better idea?

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
Your Highness.

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,279
I also want to do something for the people of Linzhou.

113
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,000
Please.

114
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,759
Come on.

115
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,399
All right?

116
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,000
Then you shall

117
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,319
keep your eyes sharp tomorrow.

118
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,480
Okay.

119
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,879
Darling.

120
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,079
How will you

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
handle Xiu'er?

122
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't worry about her.

123
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,160
I know what to do.

124
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,959
Darling.

125
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,240
It's late.

126
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,439
Shall we rest?

127
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,120
I'll sleep with Xiu'er.

128
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,480
Please leave.

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,199
Come on.

130
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,399
Darling.

131
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:11,879
Go out.

132
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,480
Go.

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,439
Darling.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,879
Darling.

135
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,879
Your Highness.

136
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,279
Why are you out?

137
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,439
Laifeng, Laifu.

138
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,519
Make sure

139
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,759
everything is prepared tomorrow.

140
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:26,959
Yes.

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,360
Go prepare for it.

142
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,480
Understood.
