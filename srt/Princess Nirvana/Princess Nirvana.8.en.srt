Episode 8

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,879
Darling.

6
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,239
Huh?

7
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,520
Is His Highness

8
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,519
fighting his wife?

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Don't talk nonsense, fool.

10
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,559
It seems

11
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,439
they will be occupied for a while.

12
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,159
I'm sleepy.

13
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,199
I need to sleep.

14
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,080
Aren't you leaving?

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,879
No.

16
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,800
If they fight fiercely,

17
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,240
I need to stop.

18
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,439
Can you stop them?

19
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,638
Just leave with me.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Come on.

21
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,519
Darling.

22
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,478
You...

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,400
I...

24
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,520
I'd better leave the mansion.

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,919
I'm going to write the divorce agreement.

26
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,918
Since you've married me,

27
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,680
you are my consort now

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,280
and you will go nowhere

29
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,439
without my permission.

30
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,319
I'm the spy sent by the Eldest Prince and Lady Shu,

31
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,759
yet you still keep me here?

32
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,478
You stay here,

33
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,159
I'll leave.

34
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,000
Wait, daring.

35
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,439
Darling.

36
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,240
You don't want to see me?

37
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,879
No...

38
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
I just

39
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,279
caught cold

40
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,399
and don't feel well.

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,879
So I'm going back to rest.

42
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,600
What are those things?

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,959
Since you ditched many clothes

44
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,279
and ornaments given by my eldest brother,

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
I bought the new things for you.

46
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

47
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,240
But

48
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,079
I still have some left,

49
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,800
so you needn't worry about it.

50
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,480
Just accept them

51
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
as I told you.

52
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,040
Stop.

53
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

54
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,959
Why did you leave once you saw me?

55
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,199
Am I

56
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,240
such a nasty man

57
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,120
to you?

58
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
You are not.

59
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,240
I just

60
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,600
caught cold

61
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,839
and don't feel well.

62
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,639
Laifu.

63
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,879
Go fetch a heater for my wife.

64
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,759
Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,519
Darling,

66
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,199
do you need me to walk you back?

67
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,600
No.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,160
Since I'm ill,

69
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
I'd better go back alone.

70
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,319
What does Zhao Qing want to do?

71
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,839
It was just an accident that day,

72
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
does he

73
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,360
take it seriously?

74
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,519
What's wrong with me?

75
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,439
What?

76
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,959
Are you hesitating?

77
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,959
Don't forget

78
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,399
how ruthless he was

79
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,800
when he refused the marriage

80
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,000
and let you drink the toxic tea.

81
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,399
You are right.

82
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,480
I can't give up taking revenge

83
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,800
because of his kindness.

84
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,279
If you really wanted to take revenge,

85
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,079
why did you ride hundreds of kilometers to take the herb for him?

86
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,040
Stop lying to yourself.

87
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,399
Wake up.

88
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,800
Don't be bewitched by that murderer's tenderness.

89
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,800
You want to make the same mistake?

90
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,879
It's good

91
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,160
to correct one's wrong.

92
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,399
He treats you kindly

93
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,040
because he knows his mistake.

94
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,360
Can't you give him a chance to make it right?

95
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,600
Don't be naive.

96
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,160
He is kind to Lin Yan,

97
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
not you, Chu Ziqian.

98
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,600
So what?

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,560
Lin Yan is Chu Ziqian now.

100
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,160
Shouldn't he

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
make up

102
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,279
for what he owed you?

103
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,000
Chu Ziqian.

104
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
Don be soft.

105
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,240
That man is so scheming

106
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,199
that you must be vigilant.

107
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,680
Don't be so arbitrary.

108
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,920
We managed to have revived,

109
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,879
we shall trust him once.

110
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,399
We need to take revenge.

111
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:20,959
He is Qing after all.

112
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,680
Enough.

113
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,560
Qing.

114
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,080
No matter what happened between us,

115
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,200
I won't forget who I am.

116
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,039
I am Chu Ziqian.

117
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,558
I gave you my heart

118
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
and what I got in return

119
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,670
is the toxic tea.
