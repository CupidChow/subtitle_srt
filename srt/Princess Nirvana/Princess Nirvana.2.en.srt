Princess Nirvana

Episode 2

5
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,319
Lin Yin

6
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,319
isn't as dumb as the rumor has it.

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,159
So I need a new plan.

8
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,598
Lady.

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,359
We've arrived.

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,760
To think

11
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,959
I'm marrying him

12
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,798
in this way.

13
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:04,959
Your Highness.

14
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,158
It is almost the time.

15
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,238
Shall I

16
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,560
take off your mourning apparel?

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,680
No.

18
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,719
I still need it.

19
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,918
<i>Lady Shu</i>

20
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,719
Qing.
<i>Lady Shu</i>

21
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,799
<i>Lady Shu</i>

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,250
Your father is busy on the national affairs,
<i>Lady Shu</i>

23
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,360
Your father is busy on the national affairs,

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
so

25
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,918
I came to

26
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,879
attend your wedding on behalf of him.

27
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,520
Thank you, Lady Shu.

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
I appreciate it, Lady Shu.

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,719
It's a merry day,

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
so take

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,879
off the mourning apparel.

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,960
If you insist on wearing it,

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,360
I can only report to your father

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,240
that you don't respect the royal house

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,560
and behave capriciously.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,599
You have no idea.

37
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,239
Princess Changning

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,560
was my old friend.

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,879
Since it's her funral today,

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm mourning for her

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,520
according to the etiquette,

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,919
so how could I not respect the royal house?

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,960
You...

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,400
Rites Official.

45
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,239
Yes.

46
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,280
Does His Highness's behavior

47
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,840
meet our etiquette?

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,319
It is

49
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,478
my first time

50
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,879
to see a groom in mourning apparel.

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,639
That's absurd.

52
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,280
But he is a prince after all.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,319
I can't offend a prince,

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,639
but I shall not make Lady Shu angry, either.

55
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,199
So...

56
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,000
What to do?

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,439
Don't be hard on him.

58
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,759
Lady Lin Yan is ordered to marry me,

59
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,159
but we found

60
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,000
many things in common on the way back

61
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,599
and reached some agreement.

62
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,360
She also agreed to let me

63
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,159
marry her in this apparel.

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,759
Besides,

65
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,439
I wore it

66
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,840
on the way.

67
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,759
If I take it off once I came back,

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,319
people will think that I'm wearing it

69
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,560
just to put on a show.

70
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,198
That will a humiliation to the royal house.

71
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,800
Zhao Qing.

72
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,400
You poisoned me,

73
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,439
now you are pretending to be grieved.

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,639
You are such a hypocrite.

75
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,560
Yan.

76
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you think?

77
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,119
I...

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,319
If you are embarrassed by this thing,

79
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,960
why don't we

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,000
cancel this wedding?

81
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,199
My Lady.

82
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,519
What His Highness said

83
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,639
was true

84
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,759
and reasonable.

85
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,799
We may neglect the rules.

86
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,879
But the royal house's dignity matters.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
I don't mind that His Highness

88
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
wears the mourning apparel.

89
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,879
To think she agrees to let him do that.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,879
All right then.

91
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,319
I shall not interfere in it.

92
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,720
It is the auspicious time.

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,399
The new couple

94
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,040
will...

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,759
Wait a moment.

96
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,959
I know how humble I am,

97
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,000
so I have been keeping these words to me.

98
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:26,879
Today,

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
darling, if you pity me,

100
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,680
please don't be angry at what I say.

101
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,879
Then I will

102
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
be frank in the future.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
Show me your trick.

104
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,399
Thank you for your pity.

105
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:38,720
Darling.

106
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,879
I grew up beside my father.

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,879
As a man of manners,

108
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,560
he always talked about them.

109
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,160
As the Saint said,

110
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
a gentleman shall abide

111
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,639
by all kinds of rituals.

112
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,000
Since you are a royal prince,

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,600
you must be an outstanding gentleman.

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,079
Now you are wearing the mourning apparel

115
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,839
to marry me on His Majesty's land

116
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,879
as well as your home.

117
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Think about it carefully,

118
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,560
it is not proper enough.

119
00:04:59,399 --> 00:04:59,920
But

120
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,480
His Majesty is in the prime of life

121
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
and the people here

122
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,120
are all your elders, 

123
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm sure

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,399
they won't blame you.

125
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,759
You...

126
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,040
I..

127
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,759
I'm already satisfied to marry you,

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,959
so I will not be upset for your mourning apparel.

129
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,560
Leaving the mourning apparel aside,

130
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,240
even if you don't wear...

131
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:18,879
Enough.

132
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,480
My eldest brother usualy talked

133
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,680
about your informality

134
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,439
and persistence,

135
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,399
but our chats today

136
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,759
did please me.

137
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,600
Lecher.

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
This is your weakness.

139
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,399
Hey.

140
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,199
Yes?

141
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,399
Take off my mourning apparel

142
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,879
and let the ceremony begin.

143
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,279
Yes.

144
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,839
It is the auspicious time.

145
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,560
The new couple

146
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,680
will begin to salute.

147
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,800
Salute Heaven and Earth.

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,160
Salute the elder.

149
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,399
Salute each other.

150
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,040
The ceremony is done.

151
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,639
Nice kids.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,680
From now on,

153
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,680
you will support each other

154
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,160
and have children earlier.

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,040
Since the ceremony

156
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,040
is done,

157
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
to have more children

158
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
to the royal house as His Majesty wishes,

159
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,279
other procedures

160
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,839
are all canceled.

161
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,639
I can't wait

162
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,199
to consummate.

163
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
If you will excuse me.

164
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,439
What do you want?

165
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,439
Take it easy, darling.

166
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,360
We will just do what a couple should do.

167
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,600
Darling.

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,480
Darling.

169
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,399
Darling.

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,959
Where can you go?

171
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,480
Your Highness.

172
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,800
We haven't had the wedding drink yet.

173
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,000
Why don't you

174
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,600
drink it for me?

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,600
Shouldn't

176
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,560
we

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,600
have the drink

178
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,759
together?

179
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,160
Why?

180
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,319
You don't want to?

181
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,160
I do.

182
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,079
It's my luck

183
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,759
to serve you with the drink.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,519
See how long you can endure.

185
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,000
I really want to add poison into it.

186
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,319
Since I have drunk it already,

187
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,040
darling,

188
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,720
shouldn't we continue?

189
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,559
Darling.

190
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,039
The night is long,

191
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,799
so there is no need to rush.

192
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,840
Why don't we

193
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,759
just

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
chat for a while?

195
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,639
What's the point?

196
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,759
Chat tomorrow.

197
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,399
Since you

198
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,679
don't want to do it with me,

199
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,720
you may go back

200
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,799
to where

201
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,679
you are from.

202
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,840
Please.

203
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,480
No.

204
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,360
Get out.

205
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,960
I mean

206
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,279
this thing

207
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,639
shall be done naturally.

208
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,519
Huh?

209
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,279
How to do it naturally?

210
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Your Highness, come.

211
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,080
Since you

212
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,159
attended a funeral

213
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,440
and a wedding,

214
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,879
you must be exhausted.

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,240
Come.

216
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,679
Sit.

217
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,919
Let me help you

218
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,039
to relax.

219
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,679
Show me your trick.

220
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,559
Your Highness.

221
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,000
I have learned

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,919
a foreign song.

223
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,440
Let me sing it for you.

224
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,200
On a broken bridge is remained snow.

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,320
There is no you.

226
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,759
The sounds of the music instruments.

227
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,000
Enter my ears.

228
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,519
The clear rhythms

229
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,080
swells and subsides.

230
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,080
A qin win with a broken string

231
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,759
talks about the brilliant thing.

232
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,759
I play pipa in the rain.

233
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,519
The catkin dances in the wind.

234
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,959
The shy voice of qin

235
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,279
lifts up the jade screen.

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,480
Your Highness?

237
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,240
Your Highness?

238
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,399
Your Highness?

239
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,360
To think

240
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,120
the trick I learned

241
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,399
did work.

242
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
I'll use this.

243
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,519
Is she going to kill His Highness?

244
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,360
Why don't we go inside?

245
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:00,919
What are you talking about?

246
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,159
Just watch first.

247
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
His Highness

248
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,200
told us to rush in

249
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,159
if Lin Yan does something fishy.

250
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,559
Or we can't stop her.

251
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,039
Laifu.

252
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,679
Look at her.

253
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,759
She's holding a pair of scissors.

254
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:32,800
