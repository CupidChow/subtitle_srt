Episode 6

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Hurry up.

6
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,920
Come on.

7
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,599
Mister Qin.

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,400
Tell me how he is.

9
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,599
The wound isn't deep.

10
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,878
I have applied the medicine.

11
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,239
He will be fine

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
after resting a few days.

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,359
It wasn't my fault.

14
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,920
I was going to bear it for you,

15
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,200
but you chose to stand in front of me.

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,760
Qian.

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,840
Come down.

18
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,000
Qing.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,560
Don't worry.

20
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,599
I can do it.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,000
Qing.

22
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,000
Impressive?

23
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,559
Does it hurt?

24
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,079
I have got you hurt.

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,680
It's fine.

27
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,878
It doesn't hurt.

28
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,040
Qing.

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,319
Will you always protect me?

30
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,319
Trust me.

31
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,478
I will

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
always keep you safe.

33
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,000
Mister Qin.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,240
Take a look at His Highness.

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,919
Huh?

36
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,280
Why did he spit blood?

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,280
That stroke

38
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,638
didn't hurt his internal organs,

39
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,439
why is the wound so severe?

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,680
Was it

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,159
a toxic blade?

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,639
It wasn't,

43
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,120
but

44
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,879
His Highness was badly wounded

45
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,119
in the last war

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,319
which became an uncured illness.

47
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,120
Recently,

48
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,799
it keeps coming back frequently,

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm afraid he may be at stake.

50
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,240
An uncured illness?

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,639
Why haven't I heard about it?

52
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,399
His Highness has kept it

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
a secret.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,240
I think he doesn't want

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
others to worry about him.

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,039
That illness

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,719
can't be cured?

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,319
I

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,319
can only

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,240
use all the rare medicines

61
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,879
to try to prolong his life.

62
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,520
His Highness

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,199
is supposed

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,719
to stand a chance,

65
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,520
but...

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,360
But what?

67
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,479
But

68
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,759
the person who could save him is dead.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,599
Forget it.

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,080
Impossible.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
There must be another way.

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,680
No.

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,719
Why is there

74
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,638
a crucial herb missing at this critical moment?

75
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,759
What is it?

76
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,719
I'll go buy it now.

77
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,039
It's a rare one,

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,560
so I only have a few at my old house in Lingjiang.

79
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,399
But

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,599
His Highness must take it within six hours,

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
otherwise...

82
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,919
Lady.

83
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,759
Huh?

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,639
I haven't told her the specific location.

85
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,839
Go to tell her

86
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,799
that the herb

87
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,120
is in the third drawer of the right cabinet

88
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,039
in the second house of the west yard.

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,280
Okay.

90
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,560
May His Highness

91
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,319
survive it.

92
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,759
Ya.

93
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,360
Zhang Qing.

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,519
Hang in there.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,839
Don't you die

96
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,719
before I take my revenge.

97
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,480
Ya.

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,120
Mister Qin.

99
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:38,920
Lady.

100
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,800
Is this Revival Herb?

101
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,279
Yes.

102
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,519
This is the Revival Herb.

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,279
I'll decoct if for His Highness now.

104
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,519
Great.

105
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,279
Mister Qin.

106
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,120
Her Ladyship passed out.

107
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,600
Look.

108
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,759
Easy.

109
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,839
Mister Qin.

110
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,719
How is she?

111
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,720
Don't worry.

112
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,920
She is just too fatigue

113
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,399
and she will recover after resting.

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,279
It must be too hard for her

115
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,560
to ride 150 km in a day.

116
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,839
His Highness

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,759
has married a nice consort.

118
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,879
Fantastic.

119
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,920
I'll go decoct it.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,680
Your Highness.

121
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,959
You are awake.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,920
What happened?

123
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,720
Last night,

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,839
your old disease came back.

125
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,240
Her Ladyship rode 150 km

126
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,959
to take the herb to save you.

127
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,759
Then

128
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,759
she fainted due to tiredness,

129
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,319
yet she still called your name.

130
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,879
Mister Qin and I thought

131
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,920
since you were married,

132
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,199
we made the decision to...

133
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,120
Nonsense.

134
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,600
Don't you

135
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,959
know her identity?

136
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,199
Please punish me.

138
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,439
Leave.

139
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,160
Yes.

140
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,439
Zhao Qing.

141
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,399
You can't die.

142
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,560
Zhao Qing.

143
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,480
Look,

144
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,800
I didn't...

145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,879
Don't mistake it.

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,000
I know

147
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,199
Thank you

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,319
for last night.

149
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,279
Well,

150
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,319
if there is no business else,

151
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,040
I'm taking my leave.

152
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,000
It's good you made it.

153
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,000
He saved me,

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
so I had to take the herb

155
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,120
for him.

156
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,439
Besides,

157
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,360
he won't suspect me

158
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,519
for going to Chunxiang Pavilion

159
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,800
because of that.

160
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,040
What's more,

161
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,519
since he is still alive,

162
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,800
I can still ...

163
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,630
Yan.
