Episode 4

5
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,839
You mistook it.

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,840
I missed you so much

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,959
that my heart hurts bitterly

8
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,480
if I couldn't see you.

9
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,879
As for them,

10
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,679
they came with me because they worried

11
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,400
about my health.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,680
Right?

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,400
His Highness is ill,

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,200
so we worried about him

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,079
and insisted on coming.

16
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,318
Please punish us.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,239
It was barely a mistake,

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,359
so no need to punish you.

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,680
Besides,

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,680
you cared about my husband's health

21
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,958
and...

22
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,760
This lecher knows

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,640
how to take advantage of me.

24
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,640
Since you

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,959
didn't wrong me,

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,719
I

27
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,120
am relieved.

28
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,200
There are many houses for me to see,

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,840
so

30
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm taking my leave.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,479
All right.

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,240
Laifeng, Laifu.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,479
Yes.

34
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,280
Check the study

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,639
to see if there is something missing.

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,719
Also see if the decoy secret letter

37
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,239
is touched.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,520
Your Highness.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,000
Your Highness.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,319
Nothing in this room

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,280
is missing

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,599
and the secret letter isn't touched, either.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
Did she find that place?

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,719
It should be a coincidence.

46
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,519
How could she be interested in that?

47
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,319
It was so close.

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,879
Catch her.

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
There must be something confidential

50
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,239
in that secret room.

51
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,319
No.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
I have to go there again.

53
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,039
Let's go.

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,319
Everything here is related to Zhao Qing and me.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,480
Why does he

56
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,639
keep them so well?

57
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,519
This umbrella is so tattered,

58
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,879
to think he still keeps it.

59
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,839
It was my fault.

60
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,040
If I listened to you before,

61
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,480
I wouldn't have sprained my ankle

62
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,639
and you wouldn't need to carry me laboriously.

63
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,519
Don't speak like a fool.

64
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,199
I'm so glad

65
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,439
to carry you.

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,439
Thank you for holding the umbrella for me.

67
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,959
You are comforting me again.

68
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,519
Is must be so hard to carry me.

69
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,319
Look, you are sweating.

70
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,959
It's not hard

71
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,439
to carry you.

72
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,079
Then

73
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,439
I will hold the umbrella for you always.

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,000
All right.

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,800
It settled.

76
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,399
Crying like a pear blossom in the rain.

77
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,240
I wait for your return.

78
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,079
On a broken bridge is remained snow.

79
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,159
There is no you.

80
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,759
The sounds of the music instruments.

81
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,839
Enter my ears.

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
The clear rhythms

83
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,199
swells and subsides.

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,560
A qin win with a broken string

85
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,079
talks about the brilliant thing.

86
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,879
I play pipa in the rain.
The catkin dances in the wind.

87
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,719
The shy voice of qin
lifts up the jade screen.

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,199
A silk dance.

89
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
Crying like a pear blossom in the rain.

90
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,439
I wait for your return.

91
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,920
It's for you.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Do you like it?

93
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,319
Yes.

94
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,560
I wait for your return?

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,800
It's just a fool's dream.

96
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,360
Qian.

97
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,519
What are you doing?

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,399
I heard

99
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,720
that if two love birds

100
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,519
bind their hair together,

101
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,480
they may be together for many lifetimes.

102
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
This is mine.

103
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,279
Fool.

104
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,120
Only a couple

105
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,879
could bind their hair together.

106
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,839
I don't care.

107
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,839
I want to be with you always.

108
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,319
Qian.

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,279
Stop it.

110
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,199
The promise of binding hair

111
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,120
is no joke.

112
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,759
Whatever.

113
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,480
Qian.

114
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,120
Who the hell are you?

115
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,519
Why did you come here?

116
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
How did you know this secret room?

117
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,639
Your Highness.

118
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,480
Did my wife go out?

119
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,920
She didn't feel well,

120
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,759
so she slept after having supper.

121
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,160
There is an assassin here.

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
Keep my wife safe.

123
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,560
Yes.

124
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,480
Qing.

125
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
It hurts me each time

126
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,679
I see the falling flowers.

127
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,799
I don't want you to be hurt.

128
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,000
What did you say?

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,639
Nothing.
