00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,879
Yan.

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

7
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,560
Did you come

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,040
to see your seventh brother?

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
He's resting in the bedroom.

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,120
Let me invite him here.

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,359
Stop.

12
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,439
Yan, are you still angry because I sent you

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,519
to marry him?

14
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,119
I'm just going to inform him.

15
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,640
Why don't you

16
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,878
come with me?

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,239
It's his honor

18
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,840
since I have come here in person,

19
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,239
how could I go to see him?

20
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,640
Then let me invite him here.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,760
Yan.

22
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,039
I know

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,039
what you have been through

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,719
and I won't forget it.

25
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,198
In the future,

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,759
I will let you serve me

27
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,599
and

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,919
enjoy a luxury life.

29
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,280
Brother, why did you

30
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,879
enter my mansion?

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,120
Brother.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,000
There you are.

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,919
I heard

34
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,400
that you fell ill again.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,919
So I came to pay a visit.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,319
Thank you for your concern.

37
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,399
No problem.

38
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,599
As

39
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,478
the emperor-to-be,

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,080
I shall pay attention

41
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,199
to my vassal.

42
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,400
Anyway, Yan,

43
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,439
since you've married my brother,

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,759
sometimes you shall take care of your husband

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,680
instead of missing me always.

46
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,359
I...

47
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,599
My mother told me

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,759
that you brought my gifts

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,360
and your dowry all to this mansion.

50
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,039
I know you use them

51
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,319
to miss me.

52
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,439
Brother, you are still here?

53
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,638
I have national affairs to handle,

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,919
so I shall go.

55
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,599
Yan,

56
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,159
look after my brother.

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,759
Goodbye, brother.

58
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,239
Don't listen to his nonsense.

59
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,319
I didn't want to bring those things here.

60
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,879
It's your right

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,240
to decide what to bring here.

62
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,478
I won't judge it.

63
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Don't be angry.

64
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,159
Though

65
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,638
those things were brought here by me,

66
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,478
I didn't do that to miss him,

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
but...

68
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,319
but...

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,400
But what?

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,759
It's not what you think anyway.

71
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,519
Why don't I ditch those things?

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,480
Check it out.

73
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,680
I haven't seen it before.

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,920
This is nice, too.

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,759
Your Highness.

76
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,639
That painting.

77
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,519
There're trees in mountains, oh! And trees will grow.

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,920
We're happy to see our prince, oh! But he does not know.

79
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
Lin Yan hasn't seen the Eldest Prince for 100 days.

80
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,759
Look, Your Highness.

81
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,800
This.

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,600
May I be the star and you the moon.

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,120
For every night we can together glint.

84
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,560
I have been missing you, my prince...

85
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,639
Your Highness. Don't mind.

86
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,120
They will be all ditched soon.

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,480
Like I said,

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,199
it's your right

89
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,399
to ditch them

90
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
or not.

91
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,839
I won't judge it.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,959
That will be awesome.

93
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,079
My waist is sour.

94
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,000
In that case,

95
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,000
tomorrow.

96
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,439
Let me ditch the rest tomorrow.

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,439
Never put off today's business

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,839
till tomorrow.

99
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,519
Disgusting.

100
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,319
Extremely disgusting.

101
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,079
You even needed my brother

102
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
to give you such a private thing?

103
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,240
Well,

104
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,360
if I tell you

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
I didn't know it before,

106
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
do you believe it?

107
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,560
You tell me.

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,360
It's such a mess inside,

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,199
darling,

110
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,879
why don't you wait outside?

111
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:02,920
I

112
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,120
will clean it up soon.

113
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,839
Since you are no longer interested in those old things,

114
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,519
let me help you to deal with them.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
All right.

116
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,959
If you helped me earlier,

117
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,519
I wouldn't have been so exhausted.

118
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,720
Darling.

119
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,600
Darling.

120
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,519
Darling.

121
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,040
No.

122
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,319
It's the Joy Powder.

123
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,759
Darling.
