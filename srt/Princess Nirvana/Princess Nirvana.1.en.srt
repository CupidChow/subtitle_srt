Episode 1

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,439
By the grace of Heaven, 

6
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,120
the Emperor hereby decrees.

7
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,759
Zhao Qing, my seventh son,

8
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,239
has made outstanding military exploits

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,599
and reached marriageable age,

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,840
So I will marry Chu Ziqian, Princess Changning,

11
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,719
to him.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,920
The wedding will be held on an auspicious day.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,550
Issued by His Majesty.

14
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>Chu Ziqian
Princess Changning
Zhao Qing
the Seventh Prince
Issued by His Majesty.</i>

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,040
<i>Zhao Qing
the Seventh Prince
Chu Ziqian
Princess Changning</i>

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,200
I don't feel tired
<i>Zhao Qing
the Seventh Prince
Chu Ziqian
Princess Changning</i>

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,840
<i>Zhao Qing

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,410
to carry you.
<i>Zhao Qing
the Seventh Prince
Chu Ziqian
Princess Changning</i>

19
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:35,719
to carry you.

20
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,040
Then

21
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,559
I will always hold the umbrella for you.

22
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,719
Send my oral order.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,359
I'm grieved

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,760
for Princess Changning's death.

25
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:52,079
But a prince needs heir.

26
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,680
So I will marry Lin Yan, the daughter of Minister Lin,

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,359
to my seventh son, Zhao Qing.

28
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,760
I hope they can

29
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,439
take care of each other

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,560
so I won't be failed.

31
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,079
Father.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,879
I won't marry her.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,879
I won't.

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Father.

35
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,918
<i>Lord of Yan
Chu Ziqian's father</i>

36
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,039
Lord of Yan has spent all his life fighting for our country.
<i>Lord of Yan
Chu Ziqian's father</i>

37
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,280
<i>Lord of Yan
Chu Ziqian's father</i>

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,617
To think he has to bury his daughter.
<i>Lord of Yan
Chu Ziqian's father</i>

39
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:29,079
To think he has to bury his daughter.

40
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,719
Not long ago,

41
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,679
I heard that Princess Changning, Chu Ziqian,

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,719
was going to marry the Seventh Prince.

43
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,759
Then she passed away abruptly.

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,000
Right.

45
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,039
The Seventh Prince is so miserable.

46
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
His childhood sweetheart

47
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,719
just passed away suddenly.

48
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,879
He must be so grieved.

49
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,680
He has no time for grief.

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,439
Look,

51
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,239
who is the groom among the procession?

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,919
He has no choice since it's His Majesty's order.

53
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,280
Look at him.

54
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,599
The mourning apparel.

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,520
He wears mourning apparel on his wedding day.

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,759
That is interesting.

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,360
Lord.

58
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,560
The Seventh Prince is behind.

59
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,399
Go.

60
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,399
Yes.

61
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,119
Your Highness, you don't have to do this.

62
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,560
This is your wedding day,

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
so it is

64
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,400
not proper.

65
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,039
Leave.

66
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,840
If you insist on doing this,

67
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,840
could you take off 

68
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,639
the mourning apparel?

69
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,080
Can't you hear me?

70
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:35,759
Lord.

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,800
His Highness

72
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,360
didn't listen to me.

73
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,759
The Seventh Prince is so loyal.

74
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,319
Yes.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,680
But what does the bride think?

76
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:57,850
<i>Lin Yan</i>

77
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,400
Why am I

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,800
in a sedan?

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,719
That's my father.

80
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,399
Did

81
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
someone die at my home?

82
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,959
Lady Lin.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,317
I know you are upset

84
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,199
<i>Linglong
I know you are upset</i>

85
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,439
and can't forget the First Prince,
<i>Linglong</i>

86
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:26,720
<i>Linglong</i>

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,079
but please think about the overall situation
<i>Linglong</i>

88
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,360
<i>Linglong</i>

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,683
and don't do stupid things.
<i>Linglong</i>

90
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:29,519
and don't do stupid things.

91
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,120
The First Prince?

92
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,120
Wait.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,959
What did you just call me?

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,120
Lin Yan.

95
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,639
Don't play dumb.

96
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,839
When it's done,

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,519
the First Prince will reward you.

98
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,199
Yong.

99
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:51,683
Yong.

100
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:52,599
<i>Zhao Yong
the First Prince
Yong.</i>

101
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,040
<i>Zhao Yong
the First Prince</i>

102
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,120
I told you
<i>Zhao Yong
the First Prince</i>

103
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,250
<i>Zhao Yong
the First Prince</i>

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
to leave me alone.

105
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,360
Yong is so charming even when he's angry.

106
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,839
I love him so much.

107
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,680
How did I become

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,079
her?

109
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,279
Remember,

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
since you agreed to marry the Seventh Prince,

111
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,399
you have to put up with it

112
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,600
and look at the big picture.

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Who will I marry?

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
The Seventh Prince, Zhao Qing?

115
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,439
He is the largest obstacle to the First Prince to become the crown prince.

116
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,279
So the First Prince has no choice

117
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,480
but to marry you to him.

118
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,439
So you could be his informer.

119
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,439
But the Seventh Prince is so calculating

120
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,800
that he tries to irriate you by wearing the mourn apparel.

121
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,879
You shall not...

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,800
What are you doing?

123
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,439
Lady Lin.

124
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,079
Don't go there.

125
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,519
Lady Lin.

126
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,959
Didn't they tell you

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,040
that a bride shall not get off the sedan?

128
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
I know that.

129
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,279
Since you know that,

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,519
why are you doing this?

131
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,639
Annul the marriage

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
if you don't want to marry me.

133
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,439
I won't stop you.

134
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,240
You misunderstood it.

135
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,959
I know Ziqian 

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,680
was a girl

137
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,759
who's gorgeous

138
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,639
that she deserved to be your wife.

139
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,720
Therefore,

140
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,560
I'd like

141
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,040
to mourn

142
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,759
for Lady Chu

143
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,759
along

144
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,680
with you.

145
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,079
Not necessary.

146
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,399
I just want to do it alone.

147
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,000
Halt.

148
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,120
Help Lady Lin back to her sedan.

149
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,360
Yes.

150
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,680
Your Highness.

151
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,399
I can walk with you.

152
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,120
Your Highness.

153
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,839
I can walk with you.

154
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,360
Get on.

155
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,319
Carry the coffin.

156
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,000
Did you see Zhao Qing's face?

157
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,079
I guess

158
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
he is furious.

159
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,720
I was almost scared to death.

160
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,680
Behave yourself

161
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,399
and think for the greater good.

162
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,240
You want me to annul the marriage?

163
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,079
You wish.

164
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,000
We are heading for his mansion.

165
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,160
Nice job.

166
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,518
<i>Three days before</i>

167
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,120
Qian.
<i>Three days before</i>

168
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,480
<i>Three days before</i>

169
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,750
I know I was wrong to refuse the marriage,
<i>Three days before</i>

170
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,199
I know I was wrong to refuse the marriage,

171
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,199
but...

172
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,560
It wasn't because I don't want to marry you.

173
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,480
It's just

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,040
I have my own reason.

175
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,240
Qian.

176
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Don't be angry.

177
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,480
Have some water

178
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,360
and let me explain it to you.

179
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,319
Fine.

180
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,160
Zhao Qing.

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,079
Others just know we are childhood sweethearts

182
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,159
and you are a loyal man,

183
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,519
but they didn't know

184
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,879
that you didn't just refuse the marriage

185
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,320
but poisoned me.

186
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,559
Since Heaven gave me a chance to take revenge,

187
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,600
I will make you pay for it.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
You will wish you were dead.

189
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,559
I'm not the mindless Lin Yan.

190
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,559
