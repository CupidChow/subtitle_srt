Episode 3

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
You were right.

6
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:18,920
Come on.

7
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,760
What

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,920
is your business?

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,640
She needs...

10
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,359
Such a large one to trim nails?

11
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,439
Anything else?

12
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:37,840
No.

13
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,519
No.

14
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,680
My Lady, please rest well

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,439
with His Highness.

16
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,560
We're taking our leave.

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,280
Good night.

18
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,079
Good night.

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,879
Darling.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,879
What happened to me?

21
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,399
Why did I fall asleep?

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,680
You are fine, darling.

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,319
Let me continue to sing for you.

24
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,039
On a broken bridge is remained snow.

25
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,319
There is no you.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,719
The sounds of the music instruments.

27
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,280
Enter my ears.

28
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,478
The clear rhythms

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
swells and subsides.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,039
Darling.

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,319
Darling?

32
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you sleeping?

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,439
Don't you want to hurt me.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,639
I will

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,120
keep watching you.

36
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,918
Zhao Qing.

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,000
How dare you call my name directly?

38
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,159
You know your crime?

39
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,959
Since you want a game,

40
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,879
I'll play it with you to the end.

41
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,359
Minister.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,800
That is a wrong move.

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,800
Checkmake.

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,000
You lose.

45
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,839
Darling.

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,919
I heard

47
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,080
that you and Prince Changning

48
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,479
were childhood sweethearts.

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
Am I prettier

50
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,360
or her?

51
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,199
Father.

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,199
The fish bit the hook.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,400
It will run away if you don't

54
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,560
pull it.

55
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,280
Laifu.

56
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,439
Your Highness.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,759
What...

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,159
What happened to your throat?

59
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,239
Nothing.

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,039
Fetch me some medicine.

61
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,719
Yes.

62
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,239
Just a moment.

63
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,560
That woman

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,159
is so patient.

65
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,080
I waited all the night

66
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,960
and she did nothing,

67
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,519
but I became hoarse because of chatting.

68
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,599
It seems

69
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,360
I need another way.

70
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,759
Your Highness.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,120
I'll tell the guards to be vigilant

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,919
and keep an eye on Her Ladyship all the time.

73
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,959
If something fishy happens,

74
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,119
we will report it to you at once.

75
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,280
Wait.

76
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,559
Don't do it.

77
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,120
Tell my wife to wait for me in the rear garden.

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,800
Could you tell me the reason

79
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
you called me here so early?

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
Since you have married into this family,

81
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,199
you are the hostess of the mansion.

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,439
Today,

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,519
let me give you a tour of this place.

84
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,319
Thank you for your trust.

85
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,439
I will

86
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,800
do my best.

87
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
However,

88
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,319
what happened to your throat?

89
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,759
Let me send for the physician to prescribe for you.

90
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,160
That's not necessary.

91
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,360
I...

92
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,759
I have taken the medicine already.

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
You deserve it.

94
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
All right then.

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
I will pray for you everyday

96
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,399
so you may recover soon.

97
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,639
This is the west yard.

98
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,399
My brothers live here

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
when they come.

100
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,519
That is the place I used to live.

101
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,839
This is the key to it.

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,319
This is the middle yard,

103
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,800
namely our residence.

104
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,920
Keep it safe.

105
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,600
You will take care

106
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,319
of those places.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,920
All right.

108
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,920
You want me to work to death?

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,079
This is my study,

110
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
the most important place in the mansion.

111
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,360
Nobody enters it

112
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,959
without my permission.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,600
Let's go then.

114
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,120
Hold on.

115
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,959
Come with me, darling.

116
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,240
It's the keys

117
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,399
to dozens of houses in the mansion.

118
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm entrusting you

119
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,439
with them as well

120
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,480
as the account books.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,160
Please

122
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,360
take care of them.

123
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,199
I don't deserve them.

124
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,800
As a newcomer,

125
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm not familiar with the business

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,639
of the mansion,

127
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,519
nor do I dare to consider myself as the hostess.

128
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,079
I just need

129
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,399
to live at the guest room

130
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,319
in the east corner.

131
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,800
You are a brilliant woman

132
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,800
and loyal to me,

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,680
So you will do the accounts

134
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,000
and keep

135
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,519
living with me.

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,839
Your Highness, I...

137
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,680
It seems

138
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,240
you are going to divorce me.

139
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:17,839
You.

140
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,519
Bring me the divorce agreement.

141
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

142
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,279
Please don't misunderstand me.

143
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,040
Since you trust me,

144
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,120
I shall not

145
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,600
refuse it.

146
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,240
Good then.

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,160
Wretched man.

148
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
You may

149
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,959
try to acquaint yourself

150
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,480
with the yards here.

151
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,639
I have businesses to handle.

152
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,439
So if you will excuse me.

153
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,000
Since you give me this opportunity,

154
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,600
I will seize it.

155
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,558
Your Highness.

156
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,240
Your Highness.

157
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,039
Just like you expected.

158
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,559
Her Ladyship didn't leave

159
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,960
since she entered the room.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,558
I'm sure

161
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,360
she couldn't help to take actions.

162
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,960
Don't touch me.

163
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,279
I thought that woman

164
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,639
was so thorny,

165
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,679
so I

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,120
was wrong.

167
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,319
I overestimated her.

168
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,720
Come.

169
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,399
We have a thief

170
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,519
to catch.

171
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,840
Yes.

172
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,879
Let's go.

173
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,240
Catch her.

174
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,519
Give me a hand.

175
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,279
Your Highness.

176
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,799
You told me to handle the businesses of the mansion.

177
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,559
Since this room

178
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
was a mess,

179
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,399
I made the decision to clean it up.

180
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
Are you angry because of that?

181
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,159
Darling,

182
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,399
what are you talking about?

183
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,039
I couldn't be happier

184
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,879
since you are so thoughtful.

185
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,360
Your Highness.

186
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,039
Don't you have businesses to do?

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,080
Why did you

188
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,039
break into the study

189
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,080
with those guards?

190
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,320
Did you suspect

191
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,879
that I was stealing something?

192
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,519
I...

193
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,440
I didn't...
