Episode 12

5
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,159
So the case of the snatched silver

6
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,200
was fabricated by them.

7
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,719
Yue Anyang

8
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,798
is suspicious.

9
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,359
Let out this message.

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,280
Tell the people

11
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,400
that the silver for the disaster relief was found.

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,760
Yes.

13
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,679
Won't it alarm Yue Anyang?

14
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,079
You fool.

15
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,479
It will draw him out.

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,159
Let's go.

17
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,959
Come on.

18
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,640
How will you deal

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,480
with the magistrate?

20
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,159
I don't think he has the courage

21
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,799
to hide the silver.

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,280
There must be someone

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
behind him.

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,079
In fact,

25
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,319
I can guess

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,640
who that man is.

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,959
Who?

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,959
Come closer.

29
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,280
Let me tell you.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,359
You will know.

31
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,519
You are joking with me again.

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,519
Darling.

33
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,919
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,759
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,719
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,080
Lord,

38
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,240
will the Seventh Prince believe it?

39
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,840
My right eyelid keeps twisting

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,319
since I knew he'd come to look into this case.

41
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:34,759
It...

42
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,959
It can't stop.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,599
Did that person in the capital

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,960
abandon us

45
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,360
in case he would be implicated?

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,199
Silence.

47
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,439
We are on the same boat

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
and none can escape.

49
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,039
The silver and the grains

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,280
will be sent away

51
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,719
in a few days.

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,199
Without

53
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,799
the proof,

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
what can Zhao Qing do?

55
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,599
Lord.

56
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,399
Lord.

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
We have a problem.

58
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,319
The rumor has it

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,599
that someone found the silver snatched by the bandits,

60
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,039
so all the people are coming to Linzhou.

61
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,840
How's that possible?

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,759
Didn't I tell you to send away the money and the grains?

63
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,800
How did they find them?

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,719
I hid them at a secret place

65
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,319
as you ordered.

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,120
Maybe...

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,120
Maybe

68
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,080
someone spilled the beans carelessly.

69
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,039
Lord.

70
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,638
I have nothing to do with it.

71
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,359
Lord.

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,080
I didn't do it either.

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,879
Lord.

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,639
It has nothing

75
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,919
to do with me.

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,439
Tell our men

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,240
to transfer those things at once.

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,439
Anyone who knows where they are hidden

79
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,879
shall be eliminated.

80
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,679
Yes.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Hurry.

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,920
Keep up.

83
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,600
Look.

84
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,439
Let's go.

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,480
Follow them.

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,199
You will

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,720
block here

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,439
and I will block there.

89
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,240
Let nobody get away.

90
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,920
Drop the stuff.

91
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,800
We're investigating the snatched things by His Majesty's order.

92
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,160
Anyone hinders us

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,560
shall be executed.

94
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,560
Since you refuse

95
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,199
to sleep with me,

96
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,639
I have to ask Magistrate Yue

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,560
to prepare another room for me.

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,079
Come back.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,319
You'll spend the night here.

100
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,279
But

101
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,680
you will sleep on the floor.

102
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,399
You want me to stay?

103
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,279
Yes.

104
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,240
If I don't let you sleep here,

105
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,920
we will be suspected.

106
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,959
It's been a whole day,

107
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,879
I'm tired.

108
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,600
I have to rest now.

109
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,800
Your Highness.

110
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:23,920
It's done.

111
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,879
We may put an end to it.

112
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,360
Don't leak it.

113
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,079
Don't let anyone know about it before Yue Anyang tells me

114
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,279
who are part of it.

115
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,199
Yes.

116
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,120
If Zhao Qing dies here,

117
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,120
Yue Anyang will be responsible for it.

118
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,120
When they look into it,

119
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,199
the embezzlement of the disaster relief

120
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,680
will be found out.

121
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,519
Then it could be used as the motive that Yue Anyang kills the prince.

122
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,040
Okay.

123
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,240
So be it.

124
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,360
Your Highness.

125
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,160
As you ordered,

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
Xiu'er will be sent

127
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,519
to the Ministry of Internal Order.

128
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,439
Good job.

129
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,639
Xiu'er?

130
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,680
I thought he was just saying.

131
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,439
To think

132
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,310
he really arranged it well.
