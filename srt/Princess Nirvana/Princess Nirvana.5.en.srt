Episode 5

5
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:19,839
Lady.

6
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,159
Lady Shu's servant just sent a message.

7
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,640
Since you married into this family,

8
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,480
you haven't sent her

9
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,799
any information about the Seventh Prince.

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,159
So she warns you

11
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,400
to keep in mind

12
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,159
the purpose you married him.

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,879
I haven't avenged myself

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,480
and I have to be Lady Shu's pawn.

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,920
So miserable.

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Lady Shu also said

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,400
that according to the intelligence,

18
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,479
the Seventh Prince will go to Chunxiang Pavilion today

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,519
to meet Ji Bohuai, the vice chief of the Grand Court of Justice.

20
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,760
Her Ladyship orders you

21
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,079
to find out their goal

22
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,959
and tell her about it.

23
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,518
Chunxiang Pavilion?

24
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,199
Yes.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,439
Okay.

26
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,359
I see.

27
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,158
Okay.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,319
Greetings, Your Highness.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,479
Rendezvous.

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,919
Your Highness.

31
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,280
Please sit.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,159
Bohuai.

33
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,879
Have you made any progress

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,639
on that business?

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,719
Don't worry.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,879
About Princess Changning...

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,039
It's fine.

38
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:09,839
Carry on.

39
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:10,879
Your Highness.

40
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,000
About Princess Changning,

41
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,000
I have sent my men...

42
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,279
Your Highness.

43
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,119
Your Highness.

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,280
Your Highness.

45
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,479
Bohuai.

46
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,360
Just now...

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,000
You!

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,919
Who let you in?

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
Weren't you told

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,439
that nobody could enter without permission?

51
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,560
I...

52
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,679
I am a new dancer here.

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Since you

54
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,638
are a fine-looking

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,639
and stately man,

56
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,879
I'd like

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
to dance for you.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,159
Why are you nervous?

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,879
Raise your head.

60
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,159
So much for today.

61
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,840
Bohuai, you may go back to rest.

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,680
What are you waiting for?

63
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,439
Didn't you come to dance?

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,560
It was a nice dance.

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,519
I wonder if...

66
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,560
if you

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,160
can drink.

68
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,159
I...

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,199
I was just careless

70
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,600
just now.

71
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,719
Let me

72
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,639
give you another dance.

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,879
Zhao Qing.

74
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
Go to hell.

75
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,639
Why did you show up here

76
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,839
as a dancer?

77
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,199
So,

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,319
you were not satisfied with the life in my mansion

79
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,360
and came to find another way to live?

80
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,279
How did you recognize me?

81
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,399
Since the moment you entered.

82
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Then why

83
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,759
didn't you expose me

84
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,480
and acted with me intead?

85
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,800
Since you were in such a good mood,

86
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,639
how could I ruin it?

87
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,519
It's just

88
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,199
I told nobody

89
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
that I would come here,

90
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,560
how did you know it?

91
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,199
No.

92
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,360
He will see me through.

93
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,879
I have married you for several days,

94
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,159
yet

95
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,079
you have not

96
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,560
touched me yet.

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,680
I heard

98
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,040
that you would come to this Chunxiang Pavilion,

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,399
I was wondering

100
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,439
what kind of girl

101
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,519
could attract you.

102
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,920
Then I could

103
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,240
learn from her

104
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,120
and serve you.

105
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,439
Look at your expression,

106
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,839
you don't believe me?

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,600
Hold on.

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,480
In fact...

109
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,600
Who are you?

110
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,560
Go.

111
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,199
He may not believe

112
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,480
what I said just now,

113
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,439
but if I protect him now,

114
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,800
he will let

115
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,319
what happened today go

116
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,680
and

117
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,160
trust me more.

118
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,319
Look out!

119
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
Catch them all.

120
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,439
Yes.

121
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,920
Who the hell are you?

122
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,639
Why did you try to kill me?

123
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,800
Your Highness.

124
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,560
They

125
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,920
took the poison and died.

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,600
Darling.

127
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,160
Though they kept silent,

128
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
I know who sent them.

129
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,039
Don't...

130
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,519
Your Highness.

131
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,639
Your wound.

132
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,759
Your Highness.

133
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,240
Your Highness.

134
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:42,150
Your Highness.
