Episode 15

5
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,920
Look, darling.

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,359
That's the life the people deserve.

7
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,799
The people are the backbone of the state.

8
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,840
If all the people can enjoy a good life,

9
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
our Zhao will be a wealthy and strong state.

10
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,400
I'm just curious.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,439
Darling,

12
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,079
since you knew

13
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,439
the Eldest Prince was behind it,

14
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,599
why

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,599
did you mention nothing about him

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,560
in the report to His Majesty?

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,599
If I reported the truth,

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,519
my brother and his henchmen

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
would deny it.

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,599
Then the Royal Court

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,239
would be in disorder

22
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,519
and the people

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,319
would suffer in the end.

24
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,839
So I

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
warned Yue Anyang

26
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,719
and made him change.

27
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,760
You care about the state

28
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,959
and the people.

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,840
I

30
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,719
admire that.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,359
You helped me a lot

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,000
in solving the embezzlement.

33
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,239
I am

34
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,439
the one

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,599
impressed.

36
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,599
No.

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,318
It

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
was your credit.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,719
Yan.

40
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,159
I'd like

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,039
to tell you...

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,879
Your Highness.

43
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,280
You're the savior of the people of Linzhou.

44
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,198
It's our homemade osmanthus liquor.

45
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,000
Please accept it.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,159
Thank you for your kindness,

47
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,319
but we can't accept them.

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Just keep them to yourselves.

49
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,599
Thank you.

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,478
Thank you.

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,560
We appreciate it.

52
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,039
My child and I would have

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,840
been starved if you didn't help us.

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
So please accept them.

55
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,159
Thank you for your kindness.

56
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,280
We can't accept them.

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,919
We really can't.

58
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,198
We shall not accept them for free,

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,240
but we can buy them.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,199
If you agree,

61
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,080
we will accept them.

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,000
How could we do that?

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,919
Just accept them.

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,280
Take the money.

65
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,359
Here.

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,800
Thank you.

68
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

69
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,000
Here you are.

70
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,000
Here.

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,120
Pretty lady.

72
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,199
It's for you.

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Is that me?

74
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,039
Yes.

75
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,560
And that?

76
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,879
It's your husband.

77
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,319
Thank you.

78
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,120
Lady.

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,400
You're back at last.

80
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,120
Your Highness.

81
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,159
I'm a bit tired.

82
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,360
So I need a rest.

83
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,239
All right.

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Go ahead.

85
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,599
Have you noticed

86
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,039
that His Highness

87
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,000
is a bit weird?

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,080
Just work

89
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,280
instead of asking.

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,080
You...

91
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,198
Your Highness.

92
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,039
We have a situation.

93
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,840
Your Highness.

94
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
How many times did I tell you?

95
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,680
Don't be panic when you are in trouble.

96
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,759
Your Highness.

97
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,959
The assassins we sent all disappeared.

98
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,720
Magistrate Yue is imprisoned

99
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,360
and will be executed later.

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,399
What?

101
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,240
What happened?

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
Send our men to keep him

103
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,759
from talking wildly.

104
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,759
Yong.

105
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,319
Calm down.

106
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,800
I have read the report of Linzhou's case

107
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,560
which didn't mention anything about us.

108
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,240
So Yue Anyang wasn't foolish enough

109
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,639
to talk nonsense.

110
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,560
Those people

111
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,240
didn't fail my trust.

112
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,240
Because you know how to discipline them.

113
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm sure Zhao Qing didn't get any proof against us.

114
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,279
As for those bums,

115
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,560
just forget them.

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,120
Zhao Qing will

117
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,600
get the trust of father and the ministers,

118
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,680
what shall we do then?

119
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,800
You shall...

120
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,000
Prince of Yan...

121
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,399
Let me.

122
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,319
Don't move

123
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,319
if you want to recover soon.

124
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,639
I'll stay to look after you

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,560
until you recover.

126
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,480
That's not necessary.

127
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
I can take care of myself.

128
00:05:59,319 --> 00:05:59,839
Come on.

129
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Just listen to me.

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm going to prepare the things for daily life.

131
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,759
You just recuperate

132
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,920
and go nowhere

133
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,079
in these days.

134
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,360
Okay.

135
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,920
It's hot.

136
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,920
Better now?

137
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,720
Yes.

138
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,600
Rest then.

139
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,199
Sleep.

140
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,480
Let me do it.

141
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,240
My ankle is hurt,

142
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,800
not my hands.

143
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,399
The physician told you

144
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,480
to take more rest.

145
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm just doing it as he said.

146
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,160
Come on.

147
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,920
Why are you restless

148
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,480
while sleeping?

149
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,279
Easy.

150
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,360
What's wrong?

151
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,120
My ankle

152
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,920
is sprained again.

153
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,519
Let me see it.

154
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Go away.

155
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,679
Darling.

156
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,639
Why are you doing this?

157
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,320
My ankle is recovered,

158
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,320
so go back to your room.

159
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,200
Darling.
