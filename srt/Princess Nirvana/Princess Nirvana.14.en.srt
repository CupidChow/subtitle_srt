Episode 14

5
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,959
We have

6
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,798
underestimated Yue Anyang.

7
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,000
Luckily, we found...

8
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,400
Darling?

9
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,079
Darling?

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,040
Are you worrying

11
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,799
about the women who are locked up?

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,519
I wonder

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,599
where they are taken to.

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,560
I

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,719
was careless this time.

16
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,120
Fortunately, the silver for the disaster relief

17
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,239
is in our hands now.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,640
Your Highness.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,199
Something is going on.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,599
The scout reported

21
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,878
that assassins were sent

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,040
to kill Yue Anyang

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,319
from the capital.

24
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,040
The capital?

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,319
Yue Anyang is so loyal

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,159
that he'd rather die

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
than tell me who is behind it,

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,319
but he didn't expect

29
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,199
that he would be deserted

30
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,359
one day.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Your Highness.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm going with you.

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,960
No.

34
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,599
Laifeng, Laifu.

35
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,519
Yes.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,360
Protect the magistrate of Linzhou.

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,479
I'll be right there.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,719
Yes.

39
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,519
Don't worry.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
Everything will be fine.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,319
Impossible.

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
Absolutely impossible.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,479
They are my trusted men who've followed me for years

44
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,759
and their families are still here,

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,439
how could they just leave?

46
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,479
But the people who transfered the silver are not back yet.

47
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,519
Did they

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,919
get away

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,000
with the silver?

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Did they

51
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,119
encounter the bandits on the way?

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,759
We are doomed

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,759
if we lose the silver.

54
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,879
Yes.

55
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,478
The silver and the grains are disappeared

56
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,319
and the Seventh Prince

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,479
is pushing us.

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,000
This time,

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,439
we are dead.

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,639
Don't worry.

61
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,079
I've reported the situation

62
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,519
to the Eldest Prince secretly.

63
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,759
He promised

64
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,879
to help us to deal with the Seventh Prince.

65
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,120
This time,

66
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,759
if he supports us,

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
there will be nothing

68
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,759
to worry about.

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,599
Look.

70
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,359
It's the Eldest Prince's reinforcement.

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,759
He sent them to help us.

72
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,319
Greetings.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,120
I am Yue Anyang.

74
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,199
That's why I'll kill you.

75
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,719
Help.

76
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,560
Don't kill me.

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
You know too much,

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,959
so he must kill you

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,199
to

80
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,319
keep you silent.

81
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,800
From now on,

82
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,600
I will

83
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,279
follow you

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,199
to death, Your Highness.

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,800
Your Highness.

86
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,439
It's the name list of all the people in it.

87
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,240
I just followed

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,040
the order of the man above.

89
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,959
Please

90
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,519
spare my life.

91
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,560
Tell me,

92
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
who is this man above?

93
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
The Eldest Prince.

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,399
The Eldest Prince?

95
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,439
Yue Anyang,

96
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,199
you know the guilty

97
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,199
of slandering a royal prince?

98
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,959
I'm telling you

99
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,399
all the truth.

100
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,560
I can also

101
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,759
tell you a secret.

102
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,120
Let's see if your information

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,519
is worth of your life.

104
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,319
The Eldest Prince

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,439
ordered me

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,480
to hide the silver

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,680
in a cave out of the city.

108
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,959
I can

109
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,199
tell you

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,279
where it is.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,199
Please spare my life.

112
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,839
What's more,

113
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,920
it's a large amount

114
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,480
of silver.

115
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,680
So if you find it,

116
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,199
I'm sure

117
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,519
you will

118
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,360
become the crown prince.

119
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,800
Yue Anyang.

120
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,079
You still won't regret your deeds

121
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,600
and even try to bribe me.

122
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,839
The money

123
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,839
was the people's money embezzled by you,

124
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,000
so it shall be returned to the people.

125
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,240
How could I use it?

126
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,759
Laifeng, Laifu.

127
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,399
Yes.

128
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,120
Send the men to take the silver

129
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,199
and then distribute it to the people

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,399
to relieve the disaster.

131
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,279
Anyone pockets the silver

132
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,120
will be beheaded.

133
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,079
What's more,

134
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,079
make proper arrangement

135
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,240
for the women

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,399
who were sold out.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,639
Yes.

138
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,439
Then,

139
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,120
Your Highness,

140
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,600
what about me?

141
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,399
It depends on your performance.

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,199
Thank you.

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,480
Let's go.

144
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,839
On your feet.

145
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,680
Move.

146
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,040
He's still the one I love.

147
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
He's not changed at all.

148
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,560
But

149
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
why did he...

150
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,600
It's so annoying.

151
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,120
Forget it.
