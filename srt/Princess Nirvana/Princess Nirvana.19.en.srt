Episode 19

5
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,079
Thank you for risking your life

6
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,359
to save me in Chunxiang Paviliion that day.

7
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
So I have made a present for you.

8
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm wondering

9
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,719
if you'd like this wood carving.

10
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,239
Qian.

11
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,640
Father.

12
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,359
Qian.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Father, I missed you so much.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,959
I missed you, too.

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,640
Let me see if you've grown taller.

16
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,800
Your Highness, thank you for taking care of my Qian.

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,520
Lord.

18
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,280
My Lord.

19
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
It's an urgent report.

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,919
The enemy is invading our north border.

21
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,159
The minister sent His Majesty's edict,

22
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,719
you will march there

23
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,680
without delay.

24
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,039
I understand.

25
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,039
Tell the minister

26
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,319
that I'll depart now.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,919
Father.

28
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,239
You're leaving when you just came back?

29
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,039
I don't want you to go.

30
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,800
Qian.

31
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,840
I will end the war quickly

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,080
and come back to accompany you.

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,319
Okay.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,800
See what I've brought you.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,919
You like it?

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,439
Yes.

37
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,159
Your Highness.

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,680
Trust me, Uncle.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
I'll take care of Qian.

40
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,439
I hope this wood carving

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,360
belongs only to you and me.

42
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,319
Zhao Qing and Lin Yan.

43
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,039
Darling.

44
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,439
Will people become the stars in the sky after they die?

45
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,519
Yes.

46
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,519
Will they protect us?

47
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,159
I will always protect you.

48
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,439
If I leave you first,

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,839
will you watch the stars and miss me?

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,920
I won't miss you.

51
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,079
I knew you were so indifferent.

52
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,480
Because I will follow you

53
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,000
instead of living alone.

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,480
Don't say that.

55
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
If I leave you

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
one day,

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
you should keep living

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,680
with our memories.

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,839
Do you agree?

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,480
Okay.

61
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
I agree.

62
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,083
In memory of my daughter, Chu Ziqian

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,079
Father.
