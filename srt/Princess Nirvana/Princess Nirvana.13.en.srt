Episode 13

5
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,199
What...

6
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,200
What do you want?

7
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,159
Darling.

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,079
It's me.

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,680
How...

10
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,719
How did I...

11
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,079
Wait.

12
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,400
Why...

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,280
Why are you lying beside me?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,799
That

15
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,560
is my question.

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Didn't you let me get on the bed?

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,120
I must have sleepwalked.

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,879
I must have sleepwalked.

19
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,798
Your Highness.

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,040
The magistrate sent his man

21
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,039
to invite you and Her Ladyship

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,239
for a feast.

23
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,959
It's a trap.

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,000
I see.

25
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,680
Go inform the disaster victims,

26
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,439
then we stick to the plan.

27
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,640
Go ahead.

28
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,359
Your Highness.

29
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,639
Please enjoy.

30
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,439
Your Highness.

31
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,840
You have no idea.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,120
Look,

33
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,918
now

34
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,599
Linzhou is in serious disaster,

35
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,239
so this is the best meal we can prepare.

36
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,680
The people here

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
can't even fill their bellies.

38
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,759
I'm sorry for them.

39
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,080
You

40
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,000
are right.

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,199
Then I shall not

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
eat them.

43
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,280
Laifeng.

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,560
Yes.

45
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,159
Open the gate.

46
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,319
Time to eat.

47
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,560
How dare you do this?

48
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,759
Yue Anyang.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,080
Your Highness.

50
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,199
Please.

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,599
I haven't eaten so well for too long.

52
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,560
Could I have one more bowl of it?

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
All right.

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,879
Sure.

55
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,759
Thank you, Your Highness.

56
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,599
Enjoy the meal.

57
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,240
Take your time.

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,199
You may come tomorrow.

59
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,639
Thank you, My Lady.

60
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,759
Thank you, Your Highness.

61
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,439
Now we are talking.

62
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,600
Thank you for your treatment, Magistrate.

63
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,720
I am much honored

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,839
to be able

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,079
to eat with you.

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
By the way,

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,600
my wife

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,639
isn't satisfied with the room you prepared yesterday.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,000
Change one.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
No problem.

71
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,399
I'll tell them

72
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,959
to prepare another one.

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,399
That's not necessary.

74
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,879
We've chosen one,

75
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,959
so we can go there directly.

76
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
It's the shabbiest one.

77
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,199
Hold on.

78
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,959
You are so nervous.

79
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,839
Is there some secret

80
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,800
you don't want us to know?

81
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,600
You must be joking.

82
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,480
How's that possible?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,839
Yue Anyang.

84
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,319
Your Highness.

85
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,040
I have found out what you did.

86
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,079
Given your contributions to Linzhou before,

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,759
if you tell me where the silver is

88
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,040
and all the people involved in the case,

89
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,480
I may grant you a chance to live.

90
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,319
Your Highness.

91
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
I don't follow.

92
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,560
I don't understand

93
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,680
what you mean.

94
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,360
Could you enlighten me?

95
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,560
Still refuse to confess.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,560
Laifeng, Laifu.

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,120
Yes.

98
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,439
Take him to the rear yard.

99
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,399
Yes.

100
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,399
Move.

101
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,920
Get up.

102
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,319
Get up.

103
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,959
Move.

104
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Your Highness.

105
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:53,839
In you go.

106
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,199
Where are they?

107
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,759
Where are they?

108
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,079
They are gone.

109
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,279
Your Highness.

110
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,680
There are no spare grains in Linzhou.

111
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,759
The people would riot

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,199
once they knew it,

113
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,360
that was why

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,600
I used

115
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,439
the sands

116
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,360
to pretend

117
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,519
to have enough grains.

118
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,360
The people and the officials

119
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,160
of Linzhou

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,399
all waited for you anxiously.

121
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,040
Yue Anyang.

122
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,839
I'm impressed.

123
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,879
I will find a way

124
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,439
to solve the problem of Linzhou.

125
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,120
He knows, so what?

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,759
They are locked here because they couldn't

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,399
repay the debts.

128
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,319
Even the Seventh Prince

129
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,079
shall abide by the law.

130
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,000
You are right, Lord.
