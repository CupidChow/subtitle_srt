1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,030
We often say that

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,300
when you reminisce about a game,

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,100
you're actually reminiscing about a period of your youth.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,340
I didn't tell everyone

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,690
because it's been a year since we broke up,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,600
and it was ancient history to me.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,240
Of course,

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
these are just memories now.

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,920
After all,

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,740
who still clings to Contra these days?

[Episode 4]

13
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,500
FNATIC.

14
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,270
I doubt they need much introduction.

15
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,820
Our old rivals.

16
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,509
They officially entered the Chinese market last season.

17
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,840
We faced them six times,

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,270
winning four games.

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,490
As for why we lost twice,

20
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,140
Cheng,

21
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,620
do I need to repeat it?

22
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,270
No need.

23
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,039
This year, I need you to take them seriously

24
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,070
because they bought

25
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,140
a Korean import from

26
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,750
last year's world champion,

27
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,680
which is Cheng's former team, TAT.

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,860
He's called Kun.

29
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,490
I've watched

30
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,450
nine games since Kun joined FNC.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,550
Six wins and three losses,

32
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,410
with a winning rate as high as 70%.

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,229
Kun's dominance in the jungle

34
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,509
is slightly better than K.

35
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,110
He's also good at spotting the enemy's weakness

36
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,390
and creating advantages for his teammates.

37
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,860
FNATIC's strategy this season

38
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,820
is very clear:

39
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,120
it's centered around the jungler

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
carrying the whole team.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,650
So when you're facing them,

42
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,070
I hope everyone will be

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,220
consciously aware

44
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,870
of your jungle's resources.

45
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,510
With Cheng and Pang in the bottom lane,

46
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,790
we don't need to worry too much.

47
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,590
Kun won't gank his own weak lane either.

48
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,050
The top and mid lanes are Kun's main targets.

49
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,590
So those jungles must be well-coordinated.

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,390
K.

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,280
Sis.

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,070
The match is about to start.

53
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,930
What's the point of taking notes?

54
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,870
Tong Yao.

55
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,140
Besides Tamamo-no-Mae,

56
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,670
what other shikigami are you good at?

57
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,150
Besides Tamamo-no-Mae?

58
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,840
Can you play anything else?

59
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,500
We're doomed.

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,630
They'll eliminate

61
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,850
our mid laner in one ban.

62
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,850
Who said that?

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,690
I'm good at many shikigamis.

64
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,040
Menreiki, Susabi, Enenra—

65
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,950
you name it.

66
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,550
Okay.

67
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,930
During the practice match,

68
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,920
they'll ban your Tamamo-no-Mae first.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,320
So be mentally prepared.

70
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,820
We can target their junglers first,

71
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,150
banning Yamakaze, Yoto-Hime, and Yasha.

72
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,340
They'll likely use their

73
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,690
other two bans on ADCs.

74
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,050
Our first pick is Mannendake.

75
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,250
Don't let Kun have it.

76
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,680
If Hakuro isn't banned,

77
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,150
they'll likely choose the bot lane

78
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,210
with a Hakuro and Ichimokuren combo.

79
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,950
Cheng can continue with Youko.

80
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,390
Pang can choose Kuro or Umibozu.

81
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,100
They won't have many jungler options left.

82
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,579
Based on Kun's stats,

83
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,020
they might choose Ubume.

84
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,000
For the top laner, they'll likely choose

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,570
Ryomen or Shuten-Doji.

86
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,560
To make up for the junglers' damage,

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,160
it's more likely they'll choose Shuten-Doji.

88
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,390
Tong Yao.

89
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,850
Which shikigami will you choose?

90
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,880
Ootengu.

91
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
Alright, Ootengu.

92
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,610
Ootengu is here.

93
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,760
You're amazing, Pro Ming.

94
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,840
Are you psychic?

95
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,640
Tong Yao.

96
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,240
This is your first practice match

97
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,190
since joining ZGDX.

98
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,340
It can't be taken lightly.

99
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,150
Okay, okay.

100
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,670
I won't let the team down.

101
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,350
You're quite confident, huh?

102
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,910
We must win this match.

103
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,890
Let's go, guys!

104
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,459

105
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,500
Good luck.

106
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:19,990
Good luck.

107
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,589
I'll go prepare some snacks.

108
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,100
The script is written.

109
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,510
The rest is up to you.

110
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,360
Line up along the river in order.

111
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,290
Cat, pay attention.

112
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,620
Enemy junglers might be eyeing our Kirin.

113
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,800
The enemy jungler's in our jungle.

114
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,790
I'll attack their bot lane Kirin.

115
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,500
Don't.

116
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,070
Go right to your top lane Kirin.

117
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,920
I doubt they're here.

118
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,830
Cat, stay close to the jungle just in case.

119
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,350
Okay.

120
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,550
Cheng.

121
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,210
How do you know they aren't here?

122
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,700
Ubume's relatively weak early on.

123
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,230
Besides,

124
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,200
Cat clearly saw him

125
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,400
walk to his position,

126
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,990
yet he kept on walking.

127
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,070
If I'm not wrong,

128
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,250
Kun should be waiting for K at their bot lane Kirin.

Why haven't they come yet?

Tong Yao.

132
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,220
The jungler's here.

133
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,190
Nice!

134
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,990
Not even farming the ranged minions.

135
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,140
Clearly the jungler wasn't here.

136
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,340
Next time, don't risk it in blind spots.

137
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,590
What if it's a trap?

138
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,460
I checked his gaze.

139
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,510
The enemy jungler isn't very smart.

140
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,130
Sis, you're fierce, I'm scared.

141
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,010
Don't be scared.

It's not too late to kneel and beg for mercy...

Why don't you go check Weibo too?

145
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,170
Okay, time for the bot lane Kirin

146
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,890
to respawn.

147
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,710
Ignore it.

148
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,970
K, go to the top lane.

149
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,440
Ambush the enemy top laner with Cat.

150
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,850
Okay.

151
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,160
Pang, let's return to base.

152
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,390
Let Kun think there's no one in the enemy bot jungle.

153
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,310
The enemy support and bot laner have gone back.

154
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,950
Got it.

155

Kun's here.

156
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,560
Hide in the bushes near them.

157
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,670
Wait for Cat to use his divine move.

158
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,310
Then we'll catch them off guard.

159
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,670
The enemy mid laner is missing.

160
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,480
Be careful.

161
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,960
Mid and bot laners, come to me.

162
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,470
Okay.

163
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,630
They took the bait.

164
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,070
Cat, K, take out the top laner.

165
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,740
K, catch up.

166
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,060
Coming.

167
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,740
Cat, use your divine move.

168
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,400
Here I come.

169
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,850
Cat used his divine move.

173
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,190
Cheng.

174
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,940
Why don't you be a director?

175
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,570
The script was good.

176
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,270
K, Pang,

177
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,550
join me to steal the Orochi.

178
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,010
-Roger that.
-Roger that.

179
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,310
I'm down. Be careful, Cheng.

180
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,190
K, be careful.

181
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,000
Retreat, retreat!

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,590
I'm retreating.

183
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,230
I'll wait for you to respawn.

184
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,910
K, don't go.

185
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,800
I can fight.

186
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,680
Sis is at it again.

187
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,960
K, careful. I'm here.

188
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
-Nice!
-Nice!

189
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,880
We won!

190
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,590
What's wrong?

191
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,160
Brilliant! That was amazing!

192
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,030
Sis' Ootengu is impressive!

193
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,440
Talk about the fearlessness of a newbie!

194
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,500
Diving straight into the Orochi pit.

195
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,690
But I wasn't bad either.

196
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,090
You can't play like that.

197
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,990
Sis.

198
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,710
I must say,

199
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,210
your shikigami pool is quite deep.

200
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,460
-Impressive.
-Rash.

201
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,060
I thought it made sense.

202
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,260
They used up most of their skills

203
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,630
trying to kill you guys,

204
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,190
so they'd have let their guards down.

205
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,210
If we didn't strike then,

206
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,300
should I've used my skills in my grave?

207
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,940
Too risky.

208
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,380
You taught me well.

209
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,530
Even talking back?

210
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,030
Confidence is good.

211
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,820
Being overly cautious is what's troublesome.

212
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,180
Wasn't Tong Yao's approach good?

213
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,780
Exactly.

214
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,350
She's ready to fight at the drop of a hat.

215
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,730
Just keep spoiling her.

216
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,050
I ordered milk tea

217
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,670
as a reward.

218
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,710
Milk tea!

219
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,940
Let's take a break.

220
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,070
Let's go.

221
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,210
-Let's go.
-Come on, Tong Yao.

222
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,200
Let's go, let's go.

223
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,730
Let's go.

224
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,770
Cheng.

225
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,210
Aren't you coming?

226
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:28,790
No.

227
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,400
Our FNATIC is also very strong.

228
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,920
It was just one match.

229
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,720
We'll win it back soon.

230
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,060
But...

231
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,320
ZGDX's mid laner was really impressive.

232
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,910
That play was mind-blowing.

233
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,590
I look forward to meeting her on the battlefield.

234
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,859
ZGDX's trick really made me...

235
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,900
Stop watching or it'll really go to your head.

236
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,329
After elementary school,

237
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,810
I've never heard any praises.

238
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,750
A little more won't hurt.

239
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,540
I bet she looks good.

240
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,250
-Don’t listen to him.
-Right?

241
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,829
If you want praises, I'll praise you.

242
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,359
Pretty girls

243
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,160
-are all dangerous.
-Go on.

244
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,099
I think my mom told me something like that before.

245
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,190
-I know that team is amazing.
-Go ahead.

246
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,030
But next time, I won't fall for it.

247
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,770
What does that mean?

248
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,100
My dear captain.

249
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,900
I performed extremely well today.

250
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,960
Where's my praise?

251
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,750
You played well.

252
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,260
Do you have any reward for me?

253
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,670
Is there really nothing

254
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,330
about me worth praising from start to finish...

255
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,150
Here's a little red flower as a reward.

256
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,870
Keep it up.

257
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,420
Next time, you'll get one on your forehead.

258
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,870
Lu Sicheng, how childish can you be?

259
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,470
Stupid pig Lu Sicheng, this ugly flower won't come off.

260
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,130
You kept fussing for a reward,

261
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,380
yet now you want to wipe it off.

262
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,980
Why are you so hard to please?

263
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,730
Also, young ladies shouldn't use foul language.

264
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,460
Don't like the little red flower?

265
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,200
Next time I'll draw a turtle for you.

266
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,800
Screw you!

267
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,230
On your forehead.

268
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,230
Guys, listen.

269
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,430
Today's practice match was truly groundbreaking.

270
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,350
Sis' gameplay was so dope.

271
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,160
She's truly the Esports Mulan.

272
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,950
Pang, tell us about Smiling.

273
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,900
My wifey's so dope!

274
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,930
I've become a fan of Smiling too!

275
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,910
Suddenly I think I can accept

276
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,270
letting her have Cheng.

277
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,650
The mid-bot coordination was great.

278
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,750
What's going on with the mid laner, Cheng, and Pro Yang?

279
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,150
My Smiling's so awesome!

280
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,870
Can you explain...

281
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,270
-Listen.
-this esports relationship drama?

282
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,310
I second that!

283
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,520
Jian Yang was my ex when I was in school.

284
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
We broke up later.

285
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,610
It's Sis!

286
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,020
Can you see our comments?

287
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,910
She's really at the base.

288
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,950
Why did you break up?

289
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,230
Young people break up over minor disagreements.

290
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,350
Isn't that normal?

291
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,530
What reason do you need?

292
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,790
Where's Jian Yang now?

293
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,890
In Shenzhen, China

294
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,470
at CK's training base

295
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,360
-and on my blacklist.
-Childish.

296
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,950
Did you really carry the team

297
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,960
to victory today?

298
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,180
For today's practice match with FNATIC,

299
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
we originally had a huge advantage.

300
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,350
I was right under the enemy mid laner's nose,

301
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,810
returning to heal up a bit.

302
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,760
Pang, Cheng, and K were grouped up

303
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,670
pushing towers in the top lane.

304
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,610
After pushing the tower, Cheng had a sudden idea and said,

305
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,470
"Why don't we go steal an Orochi?"

306
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,910
So they

307
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,590
attempted that sneaky thing.

308
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,890
But we now know that

309
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,770
it isn't wise to do sneaky things.

310
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,600
After all, in broad daylight, everything is exposed.

311
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,780
Five enemies suddenly came

312
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,600
to encircle them.

313
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
And there was an Orochi spewing at them.

314
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,570
It was a literal dead end.

315
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,550
I didn't carry the team. Really.

316
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,950
Maybe our enemies were too fixated on killing them

317
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,750
and used up too many skills.

318
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,860
I just tied up the loose ends.

319
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,290
Who stole the Orochi?

320
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,950
I dare you to say that again.

321
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,850
-Oh boy!
-The team captain's in rage!

322
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,360
Assertive Cheng, please love me!

323
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,910
What's going on between you two?

324
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,070
Just focus on streaming.

325
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,200
What's with the sudden lover's spat?

326
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,930
Why aren't they clarifying it?

327
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,950
Clarify what?

328
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,070
There's nothing between us, okay?

329
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,470
What hand-holding and shopping together?

330
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,320
The only time Cheng and I

331
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,930
were on the street together

332
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,150
was the day I just joined the team.

333
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,440
I didn't know the way,

334
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,590
so Cheng took me to the supermarket to buy necessities.

335
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,820
None of that hand-holding and shopping.

336
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,240
Besides, it's not like I have no taste.

337
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,720
Right, and he's not...

338
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,430
What did you say?

339
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,730
It's not what you think.

340
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,340
I've just joined the team.

341
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,690
If we were a thing, we'd tell you.

342
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,470
Like giving out wedding candies?

343
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,930
Yes, yes. Wedding candies.

344
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,140
Shameless.

345
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,230
Dear user ID "Base Explosion,"

346
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,410
what do you mean by "shameless?"

347
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,550
Moderators, do your job!

348
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,420
What are you waiting for? Ban this person!

349
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,350
Waiting for your wedding candies.

350
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,150
Didn't you have your headphones on?

351
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,010
They aren't on.

352
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,540
Then who were you acting for?

353
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,270
I'm just covering my cold ears.

354
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,870
Woah. Go get it, Sis!

355
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,140
The national league will be so exciting.

356
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,680
Let's go eat together.

357
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,740
Let's celebrate our big win tonight.

358
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,320
Sure, sure!

359
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,230
What should we eat?

360
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,030
I'm starving.

361
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,830
AZ Hotpot.

362
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,100
Is that okay, Cheng?

363
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,320
Yeah, let's go.

364
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,160
Then... It's my treat!

365
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,180
Sure, your treat.

366
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,800
K, do you want to join us?

367
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,360
Let's go.

368
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,010
No.

369
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,250
I've been feeling inflamed.

370
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,750
Don't mind him.

371
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,710
That's just how he is.

372
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,170
Just let him keep playing.

373
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,070
My goodness, this beef is amazing!

374
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,760
Rui, get me two more plates.

375
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,420
Here, here.

376
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,610
This beef is incredible, gosh!

377
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,540
This beef tongue...

378
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,740
Have mine.

379
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,360
Why are you guys eating so fast?

380
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,280
-So tender.
-Let's order two more plates.

381
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,880
Slow down.

382
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,410
Eat slowly and you'll have nothing to eat.

383
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,500
Scallops, 568?

384
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,980
Were they fished from outer space?

385
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,230
Alright, alright. Leave some for me.

386
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,190
Tong Yao, you're screwed.

387
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,340
Winter melon.

388
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,310
Winter melon should be cheaper.

389
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,800
Winter melon, 78?

390
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,140
Are you kidding me?

391
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,310
Is this restaurant scamming us?

392
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,170
Why did I volunteer to pay the bill?

393
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:17,450
Nice!

394
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:21,760
Tong Yao.

395
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,880
Why are you in a daze?

396
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,650
Eat up.

397
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm... not hungry.

398
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,330
Too expensive that you can't bear to eat?

399
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,940
I just saw Cheng

400
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,480
giving his credit card to the manager.

401
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,680
He's paying the bill.

402
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,000
Waiter.

403
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,350
Bring me two bowls of shark fin soup,

404
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,010
one for drinking and the other to rinse my mouth.

405
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,420
Shorty.

406
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,350
Eat more meat

407
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,320
and grow taller.

408
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,440
Why is no one here?

409
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,850
Let's look around.

410
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,110
Look.

411
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,800
It should be here.

412
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,940
Let's go.

413
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,340
Sis.

414
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,020
There's something I've been wanting to ask you.

415
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,220
When I first invited you,

416
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,280
you didn't want to come, right?

417
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,130
You hadn't even agreed at the hotel.

418
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,660
Why did you end up agreeing?

419
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,960
I was quite surprised.

420
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,560
To be honest,

421
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,400
I thought you were a scammer at first.

422
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,580
You thought?

423
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,000
He is a scammer.

424
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,870
Me?

425
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,120
Have you ever seen such an honest scammer?

426
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,220
Sis, we need to clear this up.

427
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,670
When I invited you,

428
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,410
how was I unprofessional and like a scammer?

429
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,210
You first sent texts in English,

430
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,740
then in Chinese romanization.

431
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,070
That alone was strange.

432
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
And I thought

433
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,520
ZGDX always had

434
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,020
a substitute for Pro Ming.

435
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
Where did he go?

436
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,150
Why did you need me?

437
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,390
So I became even more suspicious of you.

438
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,760
And at first, my parents didn't agree either.

439
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,330
My parents didn't agree at first either.

440
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,330
My parents weren't on board either.

441
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,560
That's normal.

442
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,830
Among us,

443
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,610
except for K,

444
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,610
who's never mentioned his parents,

445
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,180
everyone else's parents had clear stances.

446
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,380
They were against it.

447
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,310
So I was hesitant at first.

448
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,910
Well,

449
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,130
what made you change your mind?

450
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,690
Because when I went to watch your match against CK,

451
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,630
what Pro Ming said on stage

452
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,290
convinced me

453
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,560
to become a professional gamer

454
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,160
and stand with you on the world stage

455
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,180
to win that world championship title.

456
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,380
Then I'll pat my chest

457
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,500
and tell everyone who ever doubted me

458
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,070
that I, Tong Yao, made it!

459
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,510
Too cocky?

460
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,810
Nice, nice.

461
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,600
Let's salute to our sis' dream.

462
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,060
Come on,

463
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,370
let's have a drink together.

464
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:08,980
Sure!

465
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:11,650
Here.

466
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,190
To our dreams.

467
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,790
-To our dreams!
-To our dreams!

468
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,310
Cheers!

469
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,750
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

470
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,790
Hello?

471
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,480
Is anyone here?

472
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,700
Could they be out?

473
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,780
Is anyone in?

474
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,710
How can we enter without permission?

475
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,040
But the door is open.

476
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,100
Change your shoes.

477
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,350
For what? Just come in.

478
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,070
Anyone in?

479
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,260
Hello? Is anybody in?

480
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,220
Is anyone in?

481
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Anyone in?

482
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,760
Ma'am! Who are you?

483
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,580
Hello?

484
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,380
Son.

485
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,910
Your mom's at it again!

486
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,830
To placate her again, I'll have to get on my knees...

487
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,100
Henpecked. Sorry.

488
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,750
No, not at all.

489
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,150
It's a traditional Chinese virtue.

490
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,280
A beautiful virtue.

491
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,510
Right, right.

492
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,530
Pang is right.

493
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,420
Virtue, indeed.

494
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,670
High society gentlemen who are like that

495
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,730
aren't henpecked.

496
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
It's cherishing your wife and kids.

497
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,030
When you all have spouses in the future,

498
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,690
remember what you said today.

499
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,820
If you forget,

500
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,780
I can remind you.

501
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,020
Do you have to go home?

502
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,880
Forget it.

503
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,260
They'll be fine in a few days. Let's go.

504
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,530
Let's go.

505
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,840
How is Cheng's family background like?

506
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
You don't know?

507
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,710
I only know he's quite rich.

508
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,220
Not just quite rich.

509
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,210
Have you heard of Lu Group?

510
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,710
That's their eldest son.

511
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,020
All they have is money.

512
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,470
Well, in that case,

513
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,020
shouldn't he be inheriting the company?

514
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,250
Why does it seem like his parents

515
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,010
are quite supportive of his esports career?

516
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,410
I heard that at first,

517
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,390
they weren't.

518
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,710
I don't know what happened after.

519
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,200
Anyway, by the time I joined,

520
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,160
his family had become our team's shareholders.

521
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,610
He bought it?

522
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,400
What are you gossiping about?

523
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,460
Nothing, nothing.

524
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,740
Boss, I'll be heading off.

525
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,200
Pang.

526
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,660
It was nothing.

527
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,140
We were just discussing

528
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,070
how supportive your parents are of your esports career.

529
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,030
What's there to talk about?

530
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,890
Your family doesn't support you?

531
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,470
My dad is okay with it.

532
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,160
But my mom...

533
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,190
If only my dad had the say in our family.

534
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,870
But my dad is henpecked just like yours.

535
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,250
Being henpecked is good.

536
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,080
It's good.

537
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,840
Don't expect your man to be henpecked.

538
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,690
Why not?

539
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,090
One world, one dream.

540
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,220
You're too gullible.

541
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
Let's go, Shorty.

542
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,200
Wait for me.

543
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,660
So what if you have long legs?

544
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,500
Lu Sicheng!

545
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,970
Why are you all standing here?

546
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,430
Dad.

547
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,750
Mom.

548
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,220
You...

549
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,640
You've even been drinking?

550
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,170
I haven't!

551
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,410
Mom.

552
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,080
Chrysanthemum tea.

553
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,430
It reduces inflammation, detoxifies, and protects the liver.

554
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,430
Please have a sip.

555
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,970
Don't try that with me.

556
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,760
Are we here to drink tea?

557
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,290
Yes, yes, yes.

558
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,790
You...

559
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,980
No, no.

560
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,260
What's going on with you?

561
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,510
You're a young lady.

562
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,870
Why were you drinking?

563
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,980
Didn't you say

564
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,230
you came to take on a role in some job?

565
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,080
When you left, you promised me

566
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,570
that this was a proper job.

567
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,750
Look at the state you're in.

568
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,460
You're even hiccuping from alcohol.

569
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,550
Your proper job

570
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
is going out drinking late at night?

571
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,850
Were you led astray by them?

572
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,090
Do you know their backgrounds?

573
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,460
How can you hang out with them every day?

574
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:33,930
That Chessman...

575
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,770
Who is he?

576
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,830
Mom.

577
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,740
It's not trendy anymore

578
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
to ask about someone's background.

579
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,780
Don't change the subject.

580
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,840
I'm being serious.

581
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,860
You've only been here for a few days,

582
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,920
and you've already

583
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,320
caused such a commotion.

584
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,410
They're saying online

585
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,730
that you and Chessman

586
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,600
are involved in something...

587
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,330
They even said it's relationship drama!

588
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,600
Every time I call you,

589
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,230
you hang up after a few words.

590
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,960
How can your dad and I not worry?

591
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,210
Is there any difference in the computers?

592
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,940
The difference is really huge.

593
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,780
For example, this monitor

594
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,140
is customized based on

595
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,100
personal habits and preferences.

596
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,970
Don't you agree, Hubby?

597
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,440
And this case too.

598
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,550
What's the difference?

599
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,110
It's water-cooled inside.

600
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,150
Hubby!

601
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,420
Your mom is right!

602
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,110
What does water-cooled mean?

603
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,370
Water-cooling is for heat dissipation.

604
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,130
Mom.

605
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,590
I'm doing well here.

606
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,590
What could possibly go wrong?

607
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,920
Did you not read any of those news articles

608
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,800
I sent you?

609
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,090
Dad!

610
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,690
Your mom makes a lot of sense.

611
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,410
Listen to your mom!

612
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,420
Uncle, Auntie, look.

613
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,990
These are the online comments about us.

614
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,250
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,700
I've caused trouble.

616
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,220
It's okay, Sis.

617
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,590
You see, everyone

618
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,590
is taking good care of your parents.

619
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,250
That one...

620
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,780
-Don’t look here.
-Don't bother about that.

621
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,380
-Just look at this one, yeah?
-Look at this.

622
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,230
Not bad.

623
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,540
Accident.

624
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,490
It really was an accident.

625
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,290
I promise to send these two away as soon as possible.

626
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,830
Don't panic.

627
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,740
-Sis.
-Auntie, look.

628
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,210
You didn't drink much tonight.

629
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,870
Why can't you stop hiccuping?

630
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,310
Here.

631
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,320
Have some dried mango to fix it.

632
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,960
These aren't alcohol hiccups.

633
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,040
-They're fear...
-It's about me.

634
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,920
-Fear hiccups.
-They're talking about me.

635
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,880
I understand.

636
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,840
It's normal for parents to visit.

637
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,830
We'll just

638
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,140
cooperate with Sis.

639
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,010
Let's all smile.

640
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,760
Greet Uncle and Auntie. Leave a good impression.

641
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,710
Uncle, over here.

642
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,340
These are all our trophies.

643
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,040
Never mind.

644
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,550
Cheng, just stand further away from us.

645
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,520
Thanks.

646
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,880
-So many.
-What do you think, Sis?

647
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,790
Look at this.

648
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,070
-Thank you.
-It's about me.

649
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,500
If we can get these two out quickly,

650
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,980
I'll buy everyone a month's worth of snacks!

651
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,060
This is ZGDX's training base,

652
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,370
not an acting training class.

653
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,570
I can't cooperate with your show.

654
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,850
It's such a hassle.

655
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,889
Why don't you let your parents take you home?

656
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:21,580
K!

657
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,639
Yao.

658
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,280
What are you talking about?

659
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,429
Take back what?

660
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,110
Nothing, Auntie.

661
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:34,940
Mom.

662
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,830
It's getting late.

663
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,550
You can wait

664
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,310
till the morning to scold me, can't you?

665
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:39,909
Come on.

666
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:40,730
Time to go to bed.

667
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,679
I'm not sleepy.

668
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,179
-You're leaving?
-You are sleepy.

669
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,830
Dad, Dad, come on.

670
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,590
I'm leaving too?

671
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,190
Hurry, hurry.

672
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,710
See you tomorrow, Uncle.

673
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,270
Alright.

674
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:46,909
-We're leaving.
-Okay.

675
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,540
Uncle, have some dried mango.

676
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,360
-For me?
-Yes, yes.

677
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,219
Yes, it's for you.

678
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:50,909
Then I'll take it.

679
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,540
-Sorry about that.
-Bye bye!

680
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,310
Okay, bye bye.

681
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,710
-Bye bye!
-See you, see you.

682
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,909
Okay, bye bye.

683
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,870
Tong Yao, take good care of your parents.

684
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,950
Leave it to me!

685
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,460
Yao.

686
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,410
If you're unhappy staying here,

687
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,630
come home with us tomorrow.

688
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,710
Mom.

689
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,120
What makes you think I'm unhappy here?

690
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,670
You...

691
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,850
Hubby!

692
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,830
I don't want to leave.

693
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,190
Yao.

694
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,150
Mom.

695
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,230
Dad.

696
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,910
I know you're worried about me,

697
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,020
but I'm doing quite well here.

698
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,270
I'm serious.

699
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,590
It was a bit hard to adapt at first,

700
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,910
but I truly

701
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,340
want to become a professional esports player.

702
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,600
So these are challenges I must overcome.

703
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,540
I know you're concerned about me

704
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,890
and want to arrange a stable job for me,

705
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,230
but I'm very sure

706
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,010
that's not the kind of job I want.

707
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,890
If you don't like working at a bank,

708
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,230
we can find something else.

709
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,050
Mom.

710
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,880
I know you both want what's best for me.

711
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,020
But

712
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,400
having me intern at a place you've arranged,

713
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,960
doing a job I don't like,

714
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,170
marrying someone I neither like

715
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,530
nor dislike,

716
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,090
then having children,

717
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,630
living a stable life until retirement,

718
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,020
and ending up with an epitaph that reads,

719
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,670
"Here lies an ordinary person who lived a stable life

720
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,550
but was never truly happy—"

721
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,220
that kind of life is meaningless!

722
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,830
Dad, Mom,

723
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,030
I'm an adult now,

724
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,190
so I'm not joking around

725
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,160
or just trying this out on a whim.

726
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,510
I seriously want to learn

727
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,470
how to become

728
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,850
an excellent professional esports player.

729
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,690
Who knows, maybe one day

730
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:54,970
your daughter

731
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,570
will stand on the world stage

732
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,320
and win a world championship.

733
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,700
Dream on. What champion?

734
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,800
You never know!

735
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,510
Dad.

736
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,750
What do you think?

737
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:10,820
Well...

738
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,550
your mom has a point,

739
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,400
and you...

740
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,650
You also have a point.

741
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,410
I meant everything I just said.

742
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,190
The National League is in three months.

743
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,380
I hope

744
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,130
you'll let me stay until then.

745
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,540
If I really can't adapt by then

746
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,910
or if I'm really not suited for this,

747
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,940
I'll go back home.

748
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,220
Dad.

749
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,110
Let's do what we've always done:

750
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,030
between father and daughter,

751
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,130
it's a gentleman's agreement, an equal treaty.

752
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,990
What do you say?

753
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,860
Sure.

754
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,870
A gentleman's agreement,

755
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,420
an equal treaty.

756
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,470
I knew my dad's the most open-minded and understanding.

757
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,200
Thanks, Dad!

758
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:55,890
Of course,

759
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,990
my mom's even more open-minded and understanding.

760
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,070
Okay, enough with the sweet talk.

761
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,720
Let's talk business.

762
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,270
You haven't told me who that Chessman

763
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,440
they're talking about online is.

764
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,560
Does he have feelings for you?

765
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,430
This nickname "Chessman"

766
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,460
sounds quite shady.

767
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,400
You'd better be careful.

768
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,390
Mom.

769
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,020
How many times must I tell you?

770
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,480
It's a misunderstanding.

771
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,530
You'd better just stop surfing the internet.

772
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,900
Misunderstanding?

773
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,580
What misunderstanding?

774
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,500
You...

775
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,380
just think I don't know anything,

776
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:35,980
don't you?

777
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,510
Let me tell you,

778
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,660
I'm a teacher

779
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,090
who's around young people all the time.

780
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,960
Dad.

781
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,650
Your mom has a point.

782
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Cheng?

783
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,710
Rui just cleaned up a room.

784
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,800
I'll take Uncle and Auntie downstairs to sleep.

785
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,070
Thank you, Cheng.

786
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,740
Oh, Mom and Dad,

787
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,530
let me introduce you.

788
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,520
This is our team captain,

789
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,210
Lu Sicheng, Cheng.

790
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,410
He's quite nice.

791
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,960
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

792
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,110
The room was hastily prepared.

793
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,970
Please bear with it for one night.

794
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,260
No, no.

795
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,580
We came uninvited.

796
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,380
Sorry for the trouble.

797
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,390
That's right.

798
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,370
Oh, Uncle, Auntie,

799
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,610
I forgot to mention earlier

800
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,790
that I have another name.

801
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,650
It's Chessman.

802
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,500
Okay.

803
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,810
Okay, okay,

804
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,880
Chessman.

805
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,240
Uncle, I'll carry that.

806
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,510
Thank you.

807
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,480
No problem.

808
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,240
Thank you.

809
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,990
Uncle, Auntie, this way please.

810
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,520
Let's go.

811
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,990
Sleep early.

812
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,820
Lock the door.

813
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,790
Okay.

814
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,250
See you in the morning.

815
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,990
See you in the morning.

816
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:29,610
[You can do it, Tong Yao!]

817
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,730
You can do it, Tong Yao!
