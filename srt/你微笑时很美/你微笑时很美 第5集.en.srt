1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,360
Look.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,240
It should be here.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,240
In the esports training base...

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,600
Let's go then.

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,480
Everything unbelievable

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,720
-could happen.
-Captain, any reward for me?

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,330
Here's a little red flower as a reward from your captain.

8
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,790
Stupid Lu Sicheng! The ugly flower won't come off.

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,110
You don't like the little red flower?

10
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,170
Next time, I'll draw you a turtle.

11
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,020
So they went to do

12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,680
this kind of sneaky business.

13
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,040
I dare you to say that again.

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,110
Let's go eat together.

15
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,170
My treat. My treat.

16
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,510
Alright, your treat.

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,000
However,

18
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,759
peaceful days

19
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,450
certainly don't belong here.

20
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,530
Dad.

21
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,770
Mom.

22
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,850
Who is that Chessman?

23
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,880
That Chessman you often talk about,

24
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
who is he exactly?

25
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,540
Does he have feelings for you?

26
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,080
Oh, by the way, Uncle and Auntie.

27
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,170
I forgot to mention earlier.

28
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,050
I also go by the name Chessman.

29
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,640
Good. Good.

30
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,170
[Falling into your smile]

31
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,940
[Episode 5]

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,920
I slept quite comfortably last night.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,520
Yes, indeed.

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,610
You should go to bed earlier from now on.

35
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,050
Okay.

36
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,690
That's our esports area.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,950
The environment is quite nice.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,210
-Pretty decent.
-Here's the dining area.

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,670
Come on.

40
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,540
Good morning, Uncle and Auntie.

41
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,890
-Good morning.
-We prepared a hearty breakfast.

42
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,680
We're not sure about your tastes, Uncle and Auntie,

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
so we bought a little of everything.

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
Here we have congee, youtiao, soy milk,

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,400
coffee and panini.

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,150
Please help yourselves to whatever you like.

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,810
This is really a lot.

48
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,020
Let's all eat together.

49
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,470
We've already eaten earlier.

50
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,900
Please enjoy your breakfast, Uncle and Auntie.

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,260
Alright, thank you.

52
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,230
Good morning, Uncle and Auntie.

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,480
Hello.

54
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,400
My name is Han Meimei.

55
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,370
Good morning.

56
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,260
Good morning.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,330
How do you do?

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,720
Good morning, Uncle and Auntie.

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,610
Good morning.

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,810
We need to review yesterday's match.

61
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,840
You set the time.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,600
-Morning, Uncle and Auntie.
-Morning, Uncle and Auntie.

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
Good morning.

64
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,940
Alright, let's find a time in the afternoon

65
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,100
to review it together with everyone.

66
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,700
Okay.

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,320
Dad, Mom.

68
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,750
Wait here for a moment.

69
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,010
I've called a car on DiDi Premier for you.

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,900
It should be here soon.

71
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,660
Why order premier service?

72
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,250
We can just hail a cab

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,090
on the street.

74
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:52,730
That's right.

75
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,460
You just got here.

76
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,000
You'll need money for a lot of things.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,860
Be more frugal.

78
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,490
It's okay, Mom.

79
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,970
It's not convenient to hail a cab here.

80
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,280
Using DiDi is very convenient.

81
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,680
Just a few taps on your phone, and it's done.

82
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,730
Yao.

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,450
Let me tell you something.

84
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,810
This place is quite remote.

85
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,230
When we arrived last night,

86
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,830
we hardly saw anyone around.

87
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,600
If you go out at night,

88
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,040
make sure someone goes with you.

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,100
Don't go out alone.

90
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,850
Mom.

91
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,370
I'm not a child anymore.

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,959
I can take care of myself.

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,839
Besides, we're all teammates.

94
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,790
We're about the same age.

95
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,450
It's hard to say who's looking after whom, okay?

96
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,260
If you really need to go out,

97
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,030
you can ask that Lu Sicheng to accompany you.

98
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
Cheng?

99
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,280
Forget it.

100
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
His name is...

101
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,200
Lu Sicheng?

102
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,960
What does his family do?

103
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,780
I think they're in business.

104
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
From what I've seen of him,

105
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,010
his family must be well-off.

106
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,270
He's quite polite too.

107
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,590
Has he studied abroad?

108
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,790
-Is it this one?
-Yes.

109
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,720
Yes, it is.

110
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,920
Hello.

111
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,100
This is DiDi Premier driver Li at your service.

112
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,560
Are you the passenger with phone number ending in 0305?

113
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,160
Yes. To the high-speed rail station.

114
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,690
Alright, let me help you with the luggage.

115
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,920
No need, I can manage.

116
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,540
Let me, let me.

117
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,200
-Okay.
-Please don't bother.

118
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,730
Thank you.

119
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,560
Where did he study abroad?

120
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,880
I don't know.

121
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,250
Mom.

122
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,960
Why are you asking about this?

123
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,150
Should I bring his household registration book here

124
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,800
for you to take a look?

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,530
You already have his household registration book?

126
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,800
Let's get in the car, come on.

127
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,170
Alright. Time to go.

128
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,480
Please, get in the car.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,960
Be careful.

130
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Please fasten your seatbelts.

131
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,440
Dad, Mom, have a safe trip.

132
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,850
Send me a WeChat message when you get home, okay?

133
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,650
-Okay.
-Got it.

134
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,440
Don't worry.

135
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,370
Yao,

136
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,580
good job.

137
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,230
Keep it up.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,330
Remember to eat on time.

139
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,780
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

140
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,040
Bye-bye.

141
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,150
Let's go. It's time for the regular meeting.

142
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,930
Today, we'll talk about the "Protect the Carry" strategy.

143
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,860
According to the traditional definition, the "Protect the Carry" lineup...

144
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,520
Excuse me.

145
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,490
Give me a moment, I need to pick up a package.

146
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:12,930
Okay.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,740
Let's wait for him for a bit then.

148
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,300
Pro Ming.

149
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,140
Take a look at this.

150
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,870
Is there a problem here?

151
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,780
Tong Yao.

152
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,470
These are all from your fans.

153
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,650
Your fans are so good to you.

154
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,380
It's all your favorite snacks.

155
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,430
This Bestore gift box is impressive.

156
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,850
The packaging is really exquisite.

157
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,480
Sis.

158
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,070
Your fans have good taste.

159
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,010
What's this?

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,800
Sis, you even have male fans now.

161
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,120
Dear Yao.

162
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,480
I wonder how you've been

163
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,480
-these days.
-Give it to me.

164
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,090
-Are you happy?
-You...

165
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
In the 24 hours of a day,

166
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,180
-would you spend one minute
-Cat!

167
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,890
to think of...

168
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,250
Who does "Land where

169
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,960
the Sun Blooms" here represent?

170
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
Sunflower, Jian Yang.

171
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,440
From now on, reject all packages with this name.

172
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't do that.

173
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,500
It's so delicious.

174
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,320
Everyone, attention please.

175
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,930
I think

176
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,130
the atmosphere this morning is very good.

177
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,050
Coincidentally, the club has just officially approved

178
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,330
the new team member schedule I submitted.

179
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,060
Let's begin.

180
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,300
That is to say, starting from tomorrow,

181
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,440
no one can sleep in.

182
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
What time does training start then?

183
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,640
Nine o'clock.

184
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,040
Nine o'clock?

185
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,180
Set your alarms for eight o'clock.

186
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,970
Even Shorty can go to bed early and get up early.

187
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,970
What are you two making a fuss about?

188
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,159
Exactly.

189
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
I need my beauty sleep.

190
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,600
Let's continue.

191
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Comparing their tactics with ours,

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,370
if their top laner

193
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,400
chooses a lane-dominant shikigami,

194
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,540
then our ADC and mid lane shikigami

195
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,470
will be crucial.

196
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,010
They will determine the outcome of the match.

197
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,440
Everyone, adjust your schedules.

198
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,640
Go to bed early today.

199
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,740
Time to get up!

200
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,430
Time to get up!

201
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,450
Hurry up and get up for training!

202
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,720
Let me sleep for five more minutes!

203
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,170
If you don't get up now, I'll dock your pay!

204
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,000
Rui, you're heartless!

205
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,130
Time to get up!

206
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,320
Time to get up!

207
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,290
The sun is shining, and the scenery is beautiful.

208
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,610
A new day has begun!

209
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,630
Let's cut the small talk and get down to business.

210
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,530
Since it's our first day of training, everyone take it easy.

211
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,370
Cat has more experience in physical training.

212
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,230
So he'll lead the training today.

213
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,250
Alright.

214
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,480
Since it's the first day,

215
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,040
we must make sure to warm up our joints properly.

216
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,430
Just work up a little sweat later.

217
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:08,890
Come on,

218
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,610
let's loosen up those joints.

219
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,840
Wrists.

220
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,820
Ankles.

221
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,120
That's about it.

222
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Are you all ready?

223
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,590
-Yes.
-Let's go jogging first.

224
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,410
Are you ready?

225
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,610
Yes.

226
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,550
Let's go then.

227
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,770
Come on!

228
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,340
No, that's not right.

229
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,480
Run!

230
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,240
Didn't he say jogging?

231
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,760
Don't just stand there. Go. Go.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,080
Keep up. Keep up.

233
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm so hungry. Where did Cat run to?

234
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,890
It's too much sun.

235
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,850
You're so short that the sunshine can't even reach you.

236
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,760
Lu Sicheng!

237
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm so tired.

238
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,440
So weak.

239
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,840
Captain.

240
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,000
Can you talk to Rui?

241
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,300
This is not physical training.

242
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,960
It's clearly physical abuse.

243
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,790
"Who's begging Cheng not to abuse her physically?"

244
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,620
"It's a girl's voice."

245
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,660
"Is it Smiling?"

246
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Cheng?

247
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,640
Captain?

248
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,480
I'm live streaming.

249
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,260
-The whole world can see you.
-"I saw it."

250
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,170
"Screenshot taken, screenshot taken!"

251
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,430
What are you two doing?

252
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,450
Playing hide and seek?

253
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,900
I'm live streaming.

254
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,330
Let me see.

255
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,840
"Is that Rui?"

256
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,070
"Please, guru Smiling, start a live stream."

257
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,860
"The kind with your camera turned on."

258
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,290
"You'll be seen sooner or later, so what's the point of hiding?"

259
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,290
That makes sense.

260
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,300
Tong Yao?

261
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:51,670
No.

262
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,010
Didn't you already sign a live stream contract?

263
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,250
Besides, you'll be seen sooner or later.

264
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,450
So why bother hiding?

265
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,600
I don't quite like this camera.

266
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,910
Didn't you buy a beauty filter camera?

267
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,560
Go away.

268
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,720
Keep in mind your live stream KPI.

269
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,770
45 hours isn't something you can make up in a day or two

270
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,030
at the end of the month.

271
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,770
Unless you have someone kidnap Rui by then.

272
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,310
Otherwise, he'll mercilessly

273
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,570
deduct your monthly performance bonus.

274
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,560
"She's bought a beauty filter camera."

275
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,760
"Which kind ghost

276
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,980
possessed our Cheng just now?"

277
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,990
"Why is Cheng so considerate?"

278
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,160
"Smiling, start live streaming already."

279
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,130
If you keep making a fuss, I'll end the live stream.

280
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,990
Listen to the voice of the masses.

281
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,630
Tong Yao.

282
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Looks like you have to go live today.

283
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:35,740
Alright.

284
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,680
But you need to give me some time.

285
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
I need to prepare.

286
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,560
What do you need to prepare for?

287
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,810
It's just a live stream.

288
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,910
Are you planning to dress up

289
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,830
like you're attending the Queen's dinner?

290
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,790
Rui, just leave it to me.

291
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,630
Alright, alright.

292
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,250
No.1 Fan.

293
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,280
Time to work.

294
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,560
Hello, I'm here for...

295
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,770
Hello, I'm here for Tong Yao.

296
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,830
Hello, beautiful.

297
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,200
It's an emergency.

298
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,080
Buddy, make way, please.

299
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,630
Please close the door.

300
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,070
Okay.

301
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,130
Why are you dodging?

302
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,570
Why do I feel like you're poking my eyes?

303
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,030
Girl, look at yourself.

304
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,840
Your dark circles are showing.

305
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,600
If you don't conceal them,

306
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,200
how can you face the challenge of the HD camera?

307
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,280
Girl,

308
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,750
all this late-night training

309
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,080
has dried out your skin.

310
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,570
I can't come over

311
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
to do your makeup every time.

312
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,050
Next time, do some quick fixes yourself before you go live.

313
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,650
Remember,

314
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,590
use a MIHOO mask every day

315
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,640
and hydrate more.

316
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,320
Alright, alright. I'll follow your advice, girl.

317
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,450
That's more like it.

318
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,300
I just saw Cheng downstairs.

319
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,470
He's indeed devastatingly handsome.

320
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,360
I didn't expect you two to become a ship so quickly.

321
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
What are you talking about, us becoming a ship?

322
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't talk nonsense.

323
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,720
How is that nonsense?

324
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,080
Ever since I came back from abroad,

325
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,840
I've been following this esports version of "The Legend of the White Snake."

326
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,770
Let's not bring up the old stories.

327
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,850
What? Is Jian Yang still pestering you?

328
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,860
Looks like "Land where the Sun Blooms" is back in the game, huh?

329
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,630
Stop laughing.

330
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,480
Have you made up with Ai Jia?

331
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,500
Why should I make up with him?

332
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,830
If it weren't for doing your makeup, I wouldn't even be here.

333
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,460
If you want to settle abroad with Ai Jia,

334
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,740
just tell him directly.

335
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,420
How do you know he's not willing?

336
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,950
Does he have the time to listen to me?

337
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,830
All he knows is esports.

338
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,030
Just thinking about it,

339
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,270
I know he definitely won't give up his club.

340
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,330
Even if the salary is pretty high now,

341
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,460
can he play forever?

342
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,170
Besides, he stays inside the room all day.

343
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,700
He's like a vampire.

344
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,770
Who are you calling a vampire?

345
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,550
Even if you are a vampire,

346
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,220
you're a cute one.

347
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:27,980
Is that okay?

348
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,680
Yeah.

349
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,560
So, what do you plan to do now?

350
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,270
Since I've already turned down the offer to work abroad,

351
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,510
I'll try to find a job here first.

352
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,120
I remember

353
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,550
when you were in college,

354
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,730
you worked part-time as an esports host, right?

355
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,300
I did that for Ai Jia's sake, okay?

356
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,830
I don't want to get mixed up in that circus now.

357
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,930
However,

358
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,500
someone did recently ask me to fill in

359
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,580
to host some

360
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,400
National League draw ceremony.

361
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,840
National League?

362
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,040
Isn't that the competition I'm about to participate in?

363
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,840
Did you agree?

364
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm still considering it.

365
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,570
Close your eye. I'll do your eyes.

366
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,190
Come on. Close your eyes.

367
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,530
Your sis, Smiling, is here.

368
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,180
Why are you hiding?

369
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,240
Head up, chest out.

370
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,130
The face I've made up for you

371
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,010
isn't meant to be shown to the floor.

372
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,070
That's right, Sis.

373
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,580
Why are you looking down when you're so beautifully made up?

374
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,180
The color of your lipstick is really nice.

375
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,990
What brand is it?

376
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,030
Lipstick?

377
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,480
Did she... Did she put on lipstick?

378
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,730
I can't tell at all.

379
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,030
It's Chando's carrot orange lipstick.

380
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,690
It brightens the complexion.

381
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,870
Go conquer the world with your beauty.

382
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,670
I'm done here.

383
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,850
Let me see you off, Sis.

384
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,310
I'll open the door for you.

385
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,400
Sis?

386
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,760
You look really nice.

387
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,510
Don't look so gloomy, come on.

388
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,420
-Go, go, go.
-But I've left.

389
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,430
Shoot the snake. Shoot the snake. Focus on the snake.

390
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,200
Good. Good.

391
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,220
Alright. Alright.

392
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,270
Get him, get him.

393
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,790
Get him, get him.

394
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,080
Honey...

395
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,600
Honey!

396
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,270
-What happened?
-What happened?

397
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,320
Honey!

398
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,510
Honey! Honey!

399
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,810
Honey!

400
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,670
Honey, I'm over here...

401
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,290
Pang.

402
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,640
Do I look okay?

403
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
Do I look too pale?

404
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,600
Sis.

405
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,220
You've already adjusted it hundreds of times.

406
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,110
The notification has been posted on the official Weibo account for ten minutes.

407
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,750
Go live.

408
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,640
So many people.

409
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,360
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands.

410
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,520
300,000?

411
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,290
That many?

412
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,100
Maybe we should just forget it.

413
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,700
It's okay.

414
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,530
Live-streaming platforms always inflate their viewer numbers.

415
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,560
It's probably only 20,000 or 30,000.

416
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,040
If anyone calls me ugly later, help me ban them.

417
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,360
My lifelong reputation is in your hands.

418
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,990
Alright.

419
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,800
Can you keep up with the banning?

420
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:41,920
Cheng,

421
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,680
I advise you to be kind.

422
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,150
-"Trio with pair."
-"Can't beat that."

423
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,260
-"North wind. Game!"
-"Big Four Winds."

424
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,440
-"Four twos."
-"Rocket!"

425
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,750
"The most mysterious person in history is about to show her face."

426
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,170
"How should I pretend not to dislike her

427
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,230
ugly appearance?"

428
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,990
-"Waiting for an answer right here."
-"Go back."

429
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,850
"My wife, oh my god!"

430
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,980
"Sis, you're as beautiful as I imagined."

431
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,980
"You're really a woman. My worldview is shattered."

432
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,480
Hello, everyone.

433
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,910
I'm Smiling.

434
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,200
Right.

435
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm that little-known

436
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,780
live streamer who's now playing professionally.

437
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,160
I'll be meeting with you in my live stream room

438
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,240
every month from now on.

439
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,440
Don't forget to hit the subscribe button.

440
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,700
I'm about to start playing the game.

441
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,580
Thank you all.

442
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,910
I can't see the live chat when I'm playing the game.

443
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,750
If I can't see it, it doesn't exist.

444
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm such a clever little thing.

445
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,850
"They hired a

446
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,750
primary school student to play?"

447
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,670
"I'm going to report Team ZGDX for employing child labor."

448
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,390
"You look no taller than 160 cm."

449
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,370
"Watching an elementary school student play professionally,

450
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,610
why does it feel so cute? LOL"

451
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,410
Lu Sicheng.

452
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,120
What the... Are you doing?

453
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,520
Reading the live chat. You're live streaming.

454
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,420
Mind your language.

455
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,350
Children shouldn't use bad words.

456
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,740
I didn't say anything.

457
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,720
Besides, Pang says it every day.

458
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,150
He's beyond help.

459
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,850
Why bring me up?

460
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,140
Don't read the live chat.

461
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,250
I'll get distracted.

462
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:20,780
I'll die.

463
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,800
No.

464
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,470
"Who's reading the live chat? Is it Cheng?"

465
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,230
Yes, it's me.

466
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,450
"My wife isn't Oitsuki anymore.

467
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,680
Now it's Smiling."

468
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,980
You probably need to see an eye doctor.

469
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,970
If the neurology department isn't busy,

470
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,570
I recommend you go there too.

471
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,800
What is he doing?

472
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,250
"Ah. Smiling. Ah."

473
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,340
"You're so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful."

474
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,330
"So cute, so cute."

475
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,520
Do you have to repeat it so many times?

476
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,380
Why don't you go to the bathroom and eat something to calm down?

477
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,640
Is it fun reading the live chat like that?

478
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,370
Yes, it is.

479
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,590
"Smiling, you look so adorable,

480
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,650
but why are you so fierce in the game?"

481
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,090
Because she's got a heart like a fierce tiger, yet delicate enough to sniff roses.

482
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,180
How long do you plan to keep reading them?

483
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,650
I guess until I get tired.

484
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,800
"Can you raise the height of your chair?

485
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,630
You look so short sitting like that."

486
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,130
"Can the camera capture your whole face?

487
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,460
Don't just show your forehead."

488
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,760
"Don't you know how to use the gaming chair?"

489
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,960
Do you really not know how to use the gaming chair?

490
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,350
Hey!

491
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,370
"Congratulations to you.

492
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,910
You lost so badly. LOL."

493
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,040
Rui.

494
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,320
Is the monitor you bought for Tong Yao black and white?

495
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,180
How come I didn't know about this?

496
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,930
"Sis, you look so cute when you're angry."

497
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,690
Of course.

498
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,540
Pufferfish also look cute when they're angry.

499
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,770
"You lost the very first game.

500
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,810
Sis, weren't you a smurf before?"

501
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,020
Do you believe a smurf could perform this badly?

502
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,170
"What's your relationship with my husband?"

503
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,400
Who's your husband?

504
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Call him over, and let him talk to me.

505
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,110
"You need Cheng to read the live chat for you while you're gaming?

506
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,040
How shameless."

507
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,250
Did I ask him to read the live chat for me?

508
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,070
Can someone buy some mute medicine for him?

509
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,270
I'll donate one yuan.

510
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,580
Did you see my game stats?

511
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,910
It's because he was reading the live chat.

512
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,240
"Shameless"?

513
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,700
Moderator, do your job.

514
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,100
Ban this person. Ban him.

515
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,680
I'll end the live stream here for today.

516
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,780
Your streamer is not in a good mood.

517
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,840
I need to go drink some yogurt to recharge.

518
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,300
Shorty.

519
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,040
Later, remember to send

520
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,140
the brand of your beauty filter camera

521
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,460
to Pang, okay?

522
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,210
I...

523
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,970
Lu Sicheng!

524
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,140
Were you mute in your past life?

525
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,880
"So you really bought a beauty filter camera? LOL"

526
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,710
"Sis is a bit too concerned about her image. LOL"

527
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,710
Lu Sicheng!

528
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:43,740
"Sis is so aggressive. LOL"

529
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,900
[ZGDX's new Mid Laner showed her face in live stream. The top-ranked Tamamo-no-Mae in China is actually a cute gir!]

530
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,840
Cheng.

531
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,370
Your former team TAT has come to schedule a practice match.

532
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,350
Not now.

533
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,600
I see Tong Yao is quite enthusiastic now.

534
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,760
And she's been performing well in recent practice matches.

535
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,820
-How about we…
-No.

536
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,500
Tong Yao still needs more time to train.

537
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,960
We'll talk about it later.

538
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,840
Okay.

539
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,550
You're the captain. I'll listen to you.

540
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,090
Cheng.

541
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,250
In your pocket.

542
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,310
Take out the candy.

543
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,170
It's made with Xylitol.

544
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,700
That's not allowed either.

545
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,200
There's more.

546
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,540
There's more.

547
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,590
Mrs. Lu has given instructions.

548
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,610
No candy for you.

549
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,830
Congratulations, Tai.

550
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,500
You've once again led Team TAT

551
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,460
to win the match.

552
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,090
Can you share your team's plans for the future?

553
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,580
Of course, our goal is the World Championship this year.

554
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,510
In the previous season's

555
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,640
Spring Finals,

556
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,320
you defeated the formidable opponent, Pro Niu.

557
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,670
So, in this year's Onmyoji Arena competition,

558
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,400
are there any other players you're particularly keeping an eye on?

559
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,320
Didn't our team previously send

560
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,110
many veterans to the opposing region?

561
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,540
Although they're all formidable seniors,

562
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,160
the Korean region always has new talents emerging.

563
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,430
So I'm not particularly worried.

564
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,340
What I've noticed is that

565
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,810
they recently recruited a female player.

566
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,880
I'm quite interested in that.

567
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,650
It's just that they didn't give me a chance.

568
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
I've heard that the customs in the Chinese region

569
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,160
are quite different.

570
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,280
They might be focusing on

571
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,040
more than just match results.

572
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,560
Perhaps hiring the female player is just

573
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,220
to boost the team's popularity and create buzz.

574
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,770
She probably doesn't have much skill,

575
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,760
so of course they don't dare to put her in a match.

576
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,120
Are you saying that Team ZGDX

577
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,880
rejected your invitation for a practice match?

578
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,080
Doesn't that mean they're afraid?

579
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,160
Is that the case?

580
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,860
How do you say it in Chinese again?

581
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,760
"A turtle's hiding its head"?

582
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,320
This Tai is not someone to be messed with.

583
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,090
I guess Smiling also knows

584
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,190
her own capabilities.

585
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,190
And now look what's happened.

586
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,370
The whole team has been labeled as

587
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,900
"a turtle hiding its head".

588
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,520
Arrange a practice match with Team TAT immediately.

589
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,110
With public opinion like this, what are you waiting for?

590
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,700
Mr. Li.

591
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,270
But Cheng said...

592
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,100
It's decided.

593
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,840
Have our official Weibo account respond this afternoon.

594
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,570
Understood.

595
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,280
ZGDX is truly bold. Looking forward to seeing Smiling.

596
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,720
Tai is so arrogant.

597
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,780
Let's take him down a peg or two.

598
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,370
I've said

599
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,840
now is not the time to schedule a practice match with Team TAT.

600
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,640
But they've already publicly provoked us.

601
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,080
And we've been training for so long.

602
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,010
Tong Yao, she...

603
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,400
She should be able to adapt by now.

604
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,120
Why did they provoke us, you think?

605
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,850
It must be because they've heard rumors.

606
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,710
Now, the club's PR has told the whole world

607
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,600
that our new mid laner is unbeatable in practice matches.

608
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,040
If we want to prove our strength to Korea,

609
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,440
we should challenge their sponsored teams.

610
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,270
Why do we have to respond to TAT specifically?

611
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,780
This is the club manager's decision.

612
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,200
I couldn't oppose it either.

613
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,550
The public opinion out there is saying

614
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,570
that Team ZGDX is a turtle hiding its head.

615
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,600
We can't actually be a turtle hiding our head, can we?

616
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,210
And even if we lose one match, so what?

617
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,320
Before the new season starts,

618
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,990
it's good for strong teams from the two regions

619
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,050
to test each other.

620
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,090
We'll have to face TAT sooner or later anyway.

621
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,090
Tai is different.

622
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,890
It's not as simple as just losing a match.

623
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,920
The club has already scheduled the time.

624
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,560
And they've specified that Tong Yao must play in this match.

625
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,590
Then do as you please.

626
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,690
If anything goes wrong,

627
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,550
don't come to me to clean up the mess.

628
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,320
You're being way too protective of her, don't you think?

629
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,520
You're always sticking your neck out for her.

630
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,070
Like during that esports "The Legend of the White Snake" incident before,

631
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,190
you spoke out directly online.

632
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,990
The club already came to me about it.

633
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,510
I managed to smooth things over, but now

634
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,970
you won't even let her play in the practice match.

635
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,230
It's really baffling.

636
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
You know very well

637
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,150
that a pre-season practice match against a strong Korean team

638
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,970
would improve our skills

639
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,640
much more than playing against

640
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,100
domestic teams just below our level, right?

641
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,600
And what's wrong with losing one game?

642
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,830
It's not like our confidence would be shattered.

643
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,560
I really don't understand you.

644
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,640
Lu Sicheng.

645
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,650
You don't really have feelings for Tong Yao, do you?

646
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,980
I had no idea you were into office romance.

647
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,950
I'm not going to answer that question.

648
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,660
Think about it yourself.

649
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,390
How ridiculous do you think what you just said is?

650
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,740
So the reason you're so protective of her

651
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,580
is because she's a little girl?

652
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,870
You think it hasn't been easy for her to get where she is today?

653
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,600
You're afraid she'll be cut from the club if she loses a match?

654
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,160
Rui.

655
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,800
If Shorty heard you talking like this,

656
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,330
she'd probably jump up and smack you on the head.

657
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,860
When will this "Shorty" joke ever get old?

658
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,370
I don't see her as a little girl,

659
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,210
so there's no sympathy

660
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,240
or pity,

661
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,790
and I certainly don't think

662
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,760
it's been particularly difficult for her to get where she is today.

663
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,480
I see her as

664
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,640
a rookie the team can use in the future.

665
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,830
We've finally made her understand

666
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,390
the importance of professional competition.

667
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,450
She's just integrated into the team.

668
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,140
This circle is full of all sorts of people,

669
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,180
good and bad.

670
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,120
Someone like her who only wants to compete

671
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,160
and achieve good results

672
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,420
is really hard to find.

673
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,500
So I don't want her to

674
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,900
be derailed by things that could be avoided

675
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,670
before she's been tempered and polished

676
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,640
into a gem.

677
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,190
I... I'm a bit confused.

678
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,570
Speaking of Tai,

679
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,770
when I was in Team TAT,

680
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,070
he was known as a notorious terror.

681
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,440
Calling him a terror

682
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,460
wasn't because he was exceptionally skilled

683
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,540
or had extraordinary talent,

684
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,530
but rather because he was more like a mid laner quality inspector.

685
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,480
He shows no mercy.

686
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,520
Team TAT once wanted to nurture new talents,

687
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,240
but only the mid laner substitutes,

688
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,890
after playing practice matches against Tai,

689
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,860
would either give up their professional careers entirely

690
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,790
or remain in the secondary league, never to recover.

691
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,810
Even now, many teams in Korea

692
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,370
refuse to have practice matches with Team TAT.

693
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,650
It's because of this.

694
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,600
He views

695
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,300
strong players as enemies.

696
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,290
In his eyes,

697
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
the so-called practice matches

698
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
are not about technical exchange at all.

699
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,890
He's solely focuses on testing the opponent's strength

700
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,020
to see if they're worthy of facing him.

701
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
Sometimes I think

702
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,560
if this guy wasn't a pro player,

703
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,970
and was in any other industry,

704
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:01,780
he'd probably be

705
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,710
a ruthless and formidable figure.

706
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,550
Do you know about Team Star, the team

707
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,340
that was once called a rising star?

708
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,000
I know, Pro Niu and the others.

709
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,180
Their damage output was really strong back then.

710
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,100
They won the championship,

711
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,290
and the game company even specially made

712
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,150
a custom season commemorative skin for them

713
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,810
to commemorate

714
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,370
their undefeated season.

715
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,650
But haven't they already retired?

716
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,520
In last season's Spring Finals,

717
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,150
Tai used this skin

718
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,590
to dominate the mid lane

719
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,850
and sent his opponents to hell in person.

720
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,080
That's just how Tai is.

721
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,150
This time, the opponent's intentions are very clear.

722
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,940
What do you think about

723
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,760
the first female professional player with the title

724
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,320
of "top-ranked Tamamo-no-Mae in China"?

725
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,580
Tong Yao is a newcomer.

726
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,010
She's been performing well in practice matches since joining the team,

727
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,140
with many impressive plays.

728
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,330
Her play style is confident and aggressive.

729
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,530
You dare to talk back?

730
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,640
Confidence is a good thing.

731
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,150
It's the timid ones that give us headaches.

732
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,530
The public is practically worshipping her.

733
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,790
I'm completely in awe.

734
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,250
If a kid like this faces setbacks,

735
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,700
since she lacks resilience,

736
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,230
she'll quickly fall apart.

737
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,080
That's why I disagree with the club

738
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,540
about letting Tong Yao compete against him.

739
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,360
Cheng.

740
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,980
So you think Tai wants to play practice matches with us

741
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,790
because he wants to target Tong Yao specifically?

742
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,130
He'll use Tamamo-no-Mae to defeat Tong Yao.

743
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,480
It's his specialty.

744
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,570
He likes to use his opponents' best heroes

745
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,010
to crush them thoroughly.

746
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,660
But Tong Yao is the top-ranked Tamamo-no-Mae in China.

747
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,290
She might not lose.

748
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,620
He's coming specifically for that title.

749
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,970
He wants everyone to know

750
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,170
who the world's best Tamamo-no-Mae is.

751
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,660
I was wrong.

752
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,450
I should have argued with the club more strongly.

753
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,910
I need to protect Tong Yao.

754
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,140
I knew you'd apologize.

755
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,360
Now's not the time to discuss that, is it?

756
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,570
So what should I do now?

757
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,220
Should I go and reject the practice match?

758
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,720
Cheng is right.

759
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,880
It's really not appropriate for Tong Yao to play now.

760
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,360
But the official Weibo account has already responded.

761
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,560
We can't back out now.

762
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,720
But being called cowards is too harsh, isn't it?

763
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,950
Rui is in a tough spot too.

764
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,350
Yeah, exactly.

765
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,810
I should let Tong Yao know.

766
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,870
That's not a good idea.

767
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,610
What is it, Cheng?

768
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,350
Having fun?

769
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,770
I didn't mean to do that.

770
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,040
If I say

771
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,710
I didn't hear anything,

772
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,470
would you believe me?

773
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,370
How much did you overhear?

774
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,580
I didn't eavesdrop.

775
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,490
Just a little bit.

776
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,740
You said my performance was good,

777
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,590
my plays were impressive, and I'm a promising talent.

778
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,790
I'm very hard to find.

779
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,050
You also said I was a gem.

780
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,810
What?

781
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,870
So, is it true?

782
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,700
You did say I was a gem?

783
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,610
I've been your teammate for so many years,

784
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,560
but I've never heard you praise me like that.

785
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,820
You're a stepping stone in the outhouse.

786
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,690
Wake up.

787
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,890
Wake up.

788
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,550
What's going on with you two, staring into each other's eyes?

789
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,870
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

790
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,260
We just denied there was anything going on between you two,

791
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,460
and now you're praising each other as a gem and starlight?

792
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,800
The ice is melting.

793
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,550
The iron tree is blooming.

794
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,840
Like spring has come upon a withered tree.

795
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,990
A bunch of idiots.

796
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,490
Let's get back to the point.

797
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,950
Since you've heard it all,

798
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,680
we won't hide it from you anymore.

799
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,830
It's 99% certain that

800
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,120
Tai is coming for you this time.

801
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,720
We've learned the lesson from Pro Niu's incident.

802
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,830
I don't want you to be forced into retirement

803
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,920
right after you were signed as a pro player.

804
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,320
After all, I was the one who discovered you.

805
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,430
I haven't even won the national championship yet.

806
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,460
Why would I retire?

807
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,100
It's not too late to turn it down now.

808
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,900
Running away may be shameful, but it's effective.

809
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,580
I'll go discuss it with the club again.

810
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,290
No.

811
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,680
Rui, don't go.

812
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,140
I want to be that beautiful girl who serves justice.

813
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,740
Since I'll have to face it someday,

814
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,950
running away won't solve anything.

815
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,640
Being defeated now

816
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,850
is better than being defeated in the official competition in the future, right?

817
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,980
-And
-That's right.

818
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,350
even if he uses Tamamo-no-Mae,

819
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,210
I can still win.

820
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,850
Quite optimistic.

821
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,230
Let's go.

822
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,830
We can still ban Tamamo-no-Mae now.

823
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,980
The opponent has banned three Mid Laners.

824
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,580
Looks like they don't want to give you any chance.

825
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,310
It's okay. I can use Higanbana.

826
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,550
Alright.

827
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,930
Let's ban Chin then.

828
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:08,710
Got it.

829
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,170
As expected, they instantly picked Tamamo-no-Mae.

830
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,659
Tong Yao.

831
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,210
Tai is targeting you.

832
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,040
If you're going to pick Higanbana,

833
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,260
remember to focus on farming.

834
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,150
Don't go head-to-head with his Tamamo-no-Mae.

835
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,949
I understand.

836
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,810
His abilities are used so accurately.

837
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,409
It's okay.

838
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,290
If you can't take him down, just focus on farming.

839
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,790
Don't worry, take it easy.

840
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,560
Pang, ward with me.

841
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,430
Okay.

842
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,290
K, move closer to the top lane to protect Cat.

843
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,450
Watch out for Tamamo-no-Mae's position.

844
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,760
Mid lane, just focus on last-hitting.

845
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,160
Don't fight him head-on.

846
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,250
K, help mid lane.

847
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,850
On my way.

848
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,980
Don't be reckless.

849
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,510
Retreat.

850
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,460
I can't hold on anymore.

851
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,500
Hang in there, Sis.

852
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,410
It's just a practice match.

853
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,770
It's okay, Sis.

854
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,190
That's right.

855
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,200
Tai has been targeting you the whole time.

856
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,690
I'm fine.

857
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Really, I'm okay.

858
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,920
It's just a game.

859
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,620
You win some, you lose some.

860
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,500
We can win it back in the next game.

861
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,030
I'm not as fragile as you think.

862
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,870
I'm really okay.

863
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,490
You guys...

864
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,080
It's getting late.

865
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,320
Everyone, go to bed.

866
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,120
I'll dock the pay of whoever can't get up tomorrow.

867
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,950
I'm off to bed.

868
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,420
Yeah, right. It's time to sleep.

869
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,150
I'm so tired.

870
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,410
Let's go, let's go.

871
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,650
Let's go, let's go.

872
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,990
-Go to bed early.
-Let's go.

873
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,790
I'm so sleepy.

874
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,560
Sleep well.

875
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,960
Beautiful girl.

876
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,060
It's time to sleep.

877
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,640
I'll go to sleep after this game.
