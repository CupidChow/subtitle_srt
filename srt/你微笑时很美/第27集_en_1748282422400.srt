1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
I really made a error

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,740
did I really shouldn't have been with?

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,920
Long Yong

00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000

00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm ugly why don't往

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,780
why you cry

9
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,620
I don't cry

10
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,620
That's because my brother was washing his face.

11
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,620
He got wet by hand.

12
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,620
That's why he cried.

13
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
How can you be so hard to look at?

14
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,620
You are a hand.

15
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,620
Can you look good?

16
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,620
Are you stupid?

17
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,620
Why don't you let me help you?

18
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
You don't need to help me.

19
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,620
I can do it myself.

20
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
I feel a little pain.

21
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,620
You are so happy that you cried.

22
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,620
What's wrong?

23
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,620
You became stronger when I came.

24
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,620
I cried.

25
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,620
What's wrong?

26
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,620
You didn't pay me back the last two days.

27
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,620
Now you are running away.

28
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
What are you doing?

29
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,620
Are you kidding me?

30
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,620
Did you pay me back?

31
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,620
I came here because I didn't trust you.

32
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,620
If you want me to leave,

33
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
you can stop crying.

34
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
Or you can stop crying.

35
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,620
I will be happy.

36
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,620
I will be happy.

37
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,620
I will be happy.

38
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,620
I will be happy.

39
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,620
I will be happy.

40
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,620
The person I love,

41
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,620
the god of OPL,

42
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,620
the god of fans,

43
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
is it really me

44
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,620
who caught him down?

45
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,620
Is it really for his own good?

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,620
Bear with it.

47
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,620
Brother Cheng.

48
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,620
It's enough.

49
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,620
Did I really do something wrong?

50
00:03:48,620 --> 00:04:10,940
You saw

51
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,620
that you wont sell me up

52
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,620
when I am doing something wrong

53
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
or just multim Budgeted Davis or something else.

54
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,020
As long as I train,

55
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,500
I can be the boss of every game.

56
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,260
Why do you keep saying that

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,620
without saying anything?

58
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,980
I can only watch you

59
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,460
and ignore you.

60
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,220
Just light me up.

61
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,380
I am a human.

62
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,140
I am a living human.

63
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,980
I am not a vacuum.

64
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,940
Brother Chen.

65
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,100
Are we going to break up?

66
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,340
You want to break up with me?

67
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,180
Because I did not do well enough.

68
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
I asked you to cry.

69
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,940
Are you going to break up with me?

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,100
You said that just now.

71
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,900
I did say that.

72
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,100
Why are you nervous?

73
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,580
You look at me like that.

74
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,780
Can I not be nervous?

75
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,580
So you are going to commit suicide now?

76
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,220
No.

77
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,620
I am just curious.

78
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,620
Why do you think so?

79
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,580
You have always been very good.

80
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,980
You are Lu Si Cheng.

81
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,340
You are Chessman.

82
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,860
You are the only one in everyone's mind.

83
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,860
No one has ever lied to you.

84
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,700
Until I appeared.

85
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,220
I was in the public.

86
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,380
I was in the public.

87
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
If there is a problem,

88
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,460
it must be me.

89
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,660
I am curious why you think so.

90
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,060
I do not want to break up with you.

91
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,860
You just ignored me a few days ago.

92
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,780
I was thinking

93
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
are you angry with me?

94
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,580
Or do you think I am annoying?

95
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,020
I am sorry.

96
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,300
I can't bear to ask you.

97
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,820
If I am really like this,

98
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,980
at least I can't leave you alone.

99
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,860
That is not so embarrassing.

100
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,460
A lot of things happened these days.

101
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,300
I was so happy.

102
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,220
And then you got hurt.

103
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,740
I was angry.

104
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,740
But I don't know who should be angry.

105
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,060
So you are angry with me?

106
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,900
No.

107
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,580
I am just angry with myself.

108
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,980
I am not willing to talk to you.

109
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,860
I don't know how to make you accept me.

110
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,380
I am not a perfect man in your heart.

111
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,980
I can't even protect you in critical times.

112
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,940
You think too much.

113
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,340
What is perfect in a perfect man?

114
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Isn't it?

115
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,140
I have seen you like this.

116
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,900
Is this the reason you broke up with me?

117
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,940
I told you.

118
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,220
I didn't.

119
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,500
Why are you still...

120
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,100
No matter what happens,

121
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,300
you can't break up with me.

122
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Uncle,

123
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,460
if I were to break up with you,

124
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,740
I would be the one to be the first to be angry.

125
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,980
That day will never come.

126
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,220
Don't think about it.

127
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,540
I will take care of you forever.

128
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,060
So I will say it again.

129
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,540
Don't think about it.

130
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,580
Here.

131
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,020
Hey.

132
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
You are so peaceful.

133
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,180
Why you are still not at home?

134
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,740
Look.

135
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,180
Yourás This should be on texted photos.

136
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,460
The reason why the ZGDX store has entered the entertainment department

137
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,740
is because they received malicious package and were hurt by the guards.

138
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,500
The ZGDX is a type of act that

139
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,860
I hope the fans can make a promise and not make a hasty move.

140
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,340
When it comes to this,

141
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,980
the ZGDX will take the legal action.

142
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,580
Brother Rui.

143
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
Wait.

144
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
Brother Rui.

145
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Brother Rui.

146
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,580
Brother Rui.

147
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,580
Brother Rui.

148
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,580
Brother Rui.

149
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,580
Brother Rui.

150
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
Brother Rui.

151
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,580
Brother Rui.

152
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
What's wrong with your face?

153
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,580
Maybe I ate something wrong last night.

154
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,460
Brother Rui, is this yours?

155
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,460
It's for the convenience.

156
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
This?

157
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,180
This is Brother Cheng's fake press.

158
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,620
And we didn't talk about it before

159
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,860
to calm down the public opinion.

160
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,300
But if we don't publicize the truth now,

161
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,580
the public opinion will be more complicated.

162
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
This is even worse.

163
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,580
And it's really useful to make this statement.

164
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,260
The person who sent you the package found it.

165
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,580
He is the one who made the same attack

166
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,980
and how he made it.

167
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,300
That person.

168
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,660
And the fans found it.

169
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,500
He announced it in the small account

170
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,580
to give you a chicken knife.

171
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,220
My god, the fans are all busy now.

172
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,700
His Weibo is going to be searched.

173
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,940
Then this is a copy.

174
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,660
It will be better.

175
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,980
Don't eat anything again.

176
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
And...

177
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,860
It's a good deal.

178
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,180
Lu Si Cheng.

179
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,740
Are you a fool?

180
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm not.

181
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,860
How did Tong Daji make the iron man?

182
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,620
You made a black iron knife.

183
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
How did Miss An Li

184
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,140
get in the way of you?

185
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,460
You're so bad.

186
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,380
You scolded Tong Yao for being so stubborn.

187
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,700
And you made a black iron knife.

188
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,220
Are you crazy?

189
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,260
Are you suspicious

190
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,620
in real life?

191
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,580
You made a black iron knife again.

192
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,420
You must be a master.

193
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,180
You're a master.

194
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,700
You're a master.

195
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,740
My fans,

196
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,620
don't be so rude.

197
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,180
You're a master.

198
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,780
You need to be more polite.

199
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,780
You're a little girl.

200
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,820
You're really Tong Daji.

201
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,940
Apologize to her.

202
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,020
Interesting.

203
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,300
The victim is still talking.

204
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,780
You're the only victim.

205
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,980
Do you have conscience?

206
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,580
Hello, everyone.

207
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,320
Hello.

208
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,020
I'm the amorous and Confucian

209
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,740
The mother is the''ld konbctrown''

210
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,900
How did Tong Daji make the iron man?

211
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,140
The iron man?

212
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,780
I'm just a normal guy.

213
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,780
I'm just a random student.

214
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,780
A loyal fan of the former ZGDX team.

215
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,780
I'm a patient.

216
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,780
I'm a patient.

217
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,780
This is the first person I got from the first person

218
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
in March.

219
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
I was so addicted to this.

220
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,780
From that time to now,

221
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,780
I've been eating.

222
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,780
I was already feeling so good.

223
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,780
But...

224
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,780
Your human behavior has already affected my life.

225
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,780
I've been so tired from that moment.

226
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,780
I've been dead for 48 hours.

227
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,780
I'm so tired.

228
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,780
You're so disappointed.

229
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,780
You're so scared.

230
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,780
Let's end this.

231
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,780
Yongbian.

232
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,780
I'm the one you're thinking of.

233
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
I'm the one you're thinking of.

234
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,780
You're so mean.

235
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,780
As a public figure,

236
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,780
you're going to be a fan of ZGDX.

237
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,780
You're so blind.

238
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
You should go and talk to him.

239
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
If something really happened to Momo,

240
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
ZGDX and his teammates...

241
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,780
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
ZGDX, please explain to Smelling.

243
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,780
I'm so blind.

244
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
Why did I do this?

245
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,780
Because of the 6th person in the entertainment industry.

246
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
I just watched a video.

247
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Momo is the main character of the entertainment industry.

248
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,780
I found out that

249
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,780
it's our hospital.

250
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
It seems like we're in a dream.

251
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,780
Momo is the one you're thinking of.

252
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
I'm so blind.

253
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,780
I'm scared of the NG.

254
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,780
The truth hasn't been revealed yet.

255
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,780
Smelling is starting to be revealed.

256
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,780
Smelling, go.

257
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
I'm so blind.

258
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,780
I've been so tired from that moment.

259
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,780
I've been dead for 48 hours.

260
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Let's go.

261
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,780
Let's go.

262
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,780
Let's go.

263
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,780
We can't leave here.

264
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,780
We can't leave here.

265
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Let's go.

266
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
We can't leave here.

267
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,780
Let's go.

268
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Let's go.

269
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,780
Let's go.

270
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
Let's go.

271
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
We can't go.

272
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
This is all because of you.

273
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,780
Why didn't you say so?

274
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
What did you say?

275
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
You can't say that.

276
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
I'm so blind.

278
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
I'm not going to participate.

279
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,300
How about this?

280
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,020
Let Tong Yao apologize first.

281
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,140
To review the online evil comments.

282
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,500
Although the whole thing has nothing to do with Tong Yao.

283
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,700
But it's still because of her.

284
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Because of her?

285
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,980
First of all, the reason for the whole thing is not because of Tong Yao.

286
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,220
It's because this girl has sent a knife to Tong Yao.

287
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,660
And this video shows the meaning of the girl's

288
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,420
medical certificate provided by her.

289
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,180
She has the behavior and the result of the video.

290
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,620
The whole thing is unclear.

291
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,380
It's impossible for Tong Yao to apologize.

292
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,140
The problem is that the public opinion is all on one side.

293
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,060
You can't make it clear.

294
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,940
Isn't it clear?

295
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,020
You call a call and call and it's clear.

296
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,500
You just protect yourself like this.

297
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,460
You pushed us out of the public.

298
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,220
Is that it?

299
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,660
Lu Si Cheng is right.

300
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,180
Actually, a fan posted a suicide video on the screen.

301
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,740
They have contacted the local police.

302
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,500
They said they didn't accept any cases of

303
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,420
the suicide of the first three students.

304
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,460
So this thing is really fake.

305
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,060
I still have a conservative opinion.

306
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,700
This thing is not as simple as it looks on the surface.

307
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,060
Lu Si Cheng.

308
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,740
Although your career is the biggest shareholder.

309
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,420
But the club is not you alone.

310
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,380
It doesn't matter how you usually make trouble.

311
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,140
But now I have to use the club as a basis.

312
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,500
You are not just a big leg.

313
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,940
The most important thing is to release the suicide.

314
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,140
And have a peaceful discussion.

315
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,420
A peaceful discussion.

316
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,180
You are the ones who are doing this.

317
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,780
Aren't you afraid of the new South?

318
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,420
Enough.

319
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,580
You don't need to say it.

320
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,340
This is the decision of the club.

321
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,740
Lu Si Cheng.

322
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,020
What are you doing?

323
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,700
You can let ZJDX's new South in the high level.

324
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,460
No.

325
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,860
Because I am the captain.

326
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,860
Since you are not responsible.

327
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,860
Then I am responsible.

328
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,420
ZJDXoooirk.

329
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,820
Lin Chi Yan.

330
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,020
ZJDX sad oppi.

331
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,500
We have to take care of this situation!

332
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,540
What do you mean what?

333
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,820
Looks like I need your help.

334
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,620
ZJDX,

335
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,500
I can do no harm.

336
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,700
It's OK.

337
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
The next long-term competition

338
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,700
we will face is the old opponent, YKCB.

339
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Through the last system analysis

340
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
and this data comparison

341
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
everyone can see very clearly

342
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
that we are close to the next team

343
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,700
and the overall strength.

344
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,700
We are a little bit higher in the economic efficiency of the attack

345
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
but in the field and the control of resources

346
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
YKCB is a little bit higher than us.

347
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
In the case of both sides' strength

348
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
we must be ready for the long-term battle.

349
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
YKCB is the most important team

350
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
in the game.

351
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,700
The person who is the most difficult to deal with is the Emperor.

352
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
He always plays the game.

353
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Brother Cheng, you need to improve your level.

354
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
When you are in the B.P. section

355
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
you must use the little Song Wan.

356
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Even if the previous period

357
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
can carry the spirit

358
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
even if it is a long-term battle

359
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
you can still hold the Emperor.

360
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Hello, you say.

361
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Come on, let's continue.

362
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Have you contacted Brother Cheng?

363
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
No.

364
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Tong Yao called too.

365
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
She didn't pick up.

366
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
It was like this yesterday.

367
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
It was like this today.

368
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,700
Do you think

369
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Tong Yao's matter

370
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
still affected Brother Cheng?

371
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
She won't.

372
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
I've been with her for so many years.

373
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
She is not

374
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
a person who has no personal matters

375
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
and no training or competition.

376
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
If she leaves

377
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
it's because she has to leave the game.

378
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
I told Tong Yao

379
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
her training time today.

380
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
I believe

381
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
when she comes back

382
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
she will come back.

383
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
But she is going to train soon.

384
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
What if she doesn't come back?

385
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Well, I'll help her.

386
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
I'll take the Song Wan.

387
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
But your hand is...

388
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Don't say it.

389
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
She is going to train soon.

390
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
Don't show your ugly face.

391
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Let's go.

392
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Brother Cheng wants to work for Chen.

393
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Go back to work.

394
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
Go back to work.

395
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Go back to work.

396
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Go back to work.

397
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Go back to work.

398
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
I'll help Brother Cheng play a game.

399
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Brother Cheng...

400
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Brother Cheng will come back

401
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
to the game tomorrow.

402
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Don't ask.

403
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Come.

404
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Let's start.

405
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,380
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

406
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,220
I'll be waiting for you. Sit down.

407
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,140
Brother Cheng.

408
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,500
Your hand...

409
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,540
Don't worry.

410
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,260
I'll do it.

411
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,100
I'll do it.

412
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,860
I'll do it.

413
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,660
I'll do it.

414
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,500
I'll do it.

415
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,460
I'll do it.

416
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,420
I'll do it.

417
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,460
I'll do it.

418
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,340
I'll do it.

419
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,300
I'll do it.

420
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,420
Don't worry.

421
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,260
I'll do it.

422
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,660
Okay.

423
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,260
Let's start.

424
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Come on.

425
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,020
We're entering the band.

426
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,820
Brother Cheng, you choose the small one.

427
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Fatty.

428
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Choose the silver grass.

429
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,340
Old cat.

430
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,380
Little cat.

431
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,460
Old brother.

432
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,500
Old cat, you're behind.

433
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,580
The same line.

434
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,500
Little cat, follow me.

435
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,300
Okay.

436
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,900
Old cat, you go up.

437
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,820
Little cat, follow me.

438
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,580
The same line.

439
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,660
Be careful, Brother Cheng.

440
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,020
What?

441
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
What's going on?

442
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,460
It's okay.

443
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Keep going.

444
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
We can't make it.

445
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,060
Let's start the game.

446
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,060
We'll play it again.

447
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,020
Brother Cheng, you're up so early.

448
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
What are you doing?

449
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
What are you doing?

450
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,500
I want to ask you.

451
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,460
What are you doing?

452
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,460
What are you doing?

453
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
What are you doing?

454
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
What are you doing?

455
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
What are you doing?

456
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,580
You didn't sleep last night, right?

457
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,780
You're on the same level.

458
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,860
The doctor said you can't train too much.

459
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,180
Do you want to take it?

460
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
It's okay.

461
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,140
You can do it.

462
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
You can't hurt them.

463
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,180
I'm fine.

464
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Look.

465
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
It's almost done.

466
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,420
How can you train like this?

467
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,420
I didn't do well last night after the training.

468
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
I just want to take a break and find a way.

469
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,420
Help me finish this.

470
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,420
I'll go to the washroom.

471
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,420
The next round is the foreign team.

472
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,420
The game is called the battle of the game.

473
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
It's delicious.

474
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
How much does it cost?

475
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
70 yuan.

476
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
I want to pay for it.

477
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,420
I'll pay for it.

478
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
You drank it all.

479
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,420
You're not a snot-dead or a king?

480
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
Take it away.

481
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
My Miss Chen.

482
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
The foreign team won the game.

483
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,420
Take it away.

484
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
�

485
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,420
Take it away.

486
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Take it away.

487
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
Take it away.

488
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
It's still there.

489
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,420
Take it away.

490
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
Take it away.

491
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Take it away.

492
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Take it away.

493
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,420
Take it away.

494
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
Take it away.

495
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,420
I want it.

496
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,420
Take it.

497
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
I also want to see.

498
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,940

Go to sleep.

502
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,540
I'm gonna buy coffee for you.

503
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,060
My daughter's your daughter's daughter's princess's daughter.

504
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,380
I...

505
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,420
Hush.

How are they?

508
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,820
The food is delicious.

Some teapot

513
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,300
Here, drink this.

514
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,860
Thanks.

515
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,620
Really?

516
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,900
Come on, let's drink this.

517
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,820
Er?

518
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,020
That sauce,

519
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,980
didn't work out,

520
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,620
僱it Almond,

521
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,660

522
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,700
but this brand needs that.

523
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,500
If food is bad,

524
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,640
X tooth,

525
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,040
it will make your fortune worse.

526
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,500
The reason is...

527
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,700
I think

528
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,420
What?

529
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,260
Shush.

530
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,700
I have no explanation.

531
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,740
No explanation.

532
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,660
I'm the one who called Huang.

533
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,780

00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,300
We're going to the wall.

535
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,420
Brother Rui asked me to bring coffee.

536
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,300
Let's go.

537
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,100
Let's go.

Are you ready?

543
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780

550
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,780
The audience please take the light bulb

551
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,780
and the biggest shout

552
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,780
First of all, please welcome

553
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,780
YQCB

554
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,780
The audience please

555
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,780
the audience please

556
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,780
the light bulb

557
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
and the big mijn

558
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
From the day the king officially joined the OPL,

559
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,780
we've been looking forward to

560
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,780
the whole league.

561
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
Finally, we've reached the final match of the day.

562
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,780
It's the day of the victory.

563
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,780
Or the surprise attack.

564
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
Let's wait and see.

565
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,780
I'm just going to be in the game again today.

566
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Are you so excited?

567
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
There are too many games.

568
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,780
What's wrong?

569
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
Brother Cheng.

570
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,780
You...

571
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
I'm just going to wait and see.

572
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,780
Don't worry. I'm fine.

573
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,780
The ADC has been in the game for a long time.

574
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,780
They can't use the game to turn the game around.

575
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,780
The ADC still has two games in the OPL.

576
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,780
They're going to play the game.

577
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,780
Let's see who will be the winner.

578
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,780
The game begins.

579
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,780
Let's welcome Lao Bao.

580
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Lao Ke.

581
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,780
Lao Pa.

582
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,780
Chin Man.

583
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,780
Lai Ling.

584
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,780
Now both teams are ready.

585
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,780
Let's welcome the members of the two teams

586
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
to come back to their positions.

587
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,780
Let's have a wonderful match.

588
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,780
The atmosphere here is really hot.

589
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,780
It's like the final match.

590
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,780
The fans here are so enthusiastic.

591
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,780
The two teams are really good at fighting.

592
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,780
They're really good at fighting.

593
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
Let's start the game later.

594
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Everyone, bring your headphones.

595
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Okay, we've entered the band and pick game.

596
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
Let's have a look.

597
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,780
The leader of the band.

598
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,780
What did our coach say today?

599
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,780
He said he wants to play the stick.

600
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
Can he tell you?

601
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,780
Can he believe it? He lied to you.

602
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,780
Although the coach has been practicing that time lately.

603
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
But...

604
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
Listen to me.

605
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,780
The leader of the band.

606
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
Move the stick.

607
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,780
Stick?

608
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Stick?

609
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
What's going on?

610
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,780
The coach's eyes are complicated.

611
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
He has a lot of problems.

612
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
A simple cover.

613
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
Five words.

614
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,780
You liar.

615
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
What's going on?

616
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
At this moment,

617
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,780
their faces seem to have been trained by the stick.

618
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,780
Brother Cheng,

619
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,780
I don't think the coach will come to hurt you.

620
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
Don't be so serious.

621
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Put me in his place.

622
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
Don't be so serious.

623
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,780
Don't be so serious.

624
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
I'll be confused later.

625
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,780
I'll take care of Tong Yao.

626
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Okay.

627
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,780
ZGDX's team moved the yellow and fox bird.

628
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,780
YQCB's team moved the old K's famous foreign-native.

629
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,780
And the smelly's early-wish.

630
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,780
Do you know if the smelly will choose the big dog again?

631
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,780
I'll choose the big dog.

632
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,780
Okay.

633
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,780
ZGDX's team chose the big dog.

634
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,780
YQCB chose the fox bird.

635
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,780
ZGDX's team chose the wild wild grass.

636
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
And the top three, the wood.

637
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,780
YQCB chose the face-to-face and the knife.

638
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,780
Now, it's just a kiss.

639
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
Brother Cheng.

640
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
The face-to-face and YQCB's face.

641
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,780
I think Cheng will take the green onion.

642
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
Yes.

643
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,780
The green onion is a more stable choice.

644
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
What?

645
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
The fox bird.

646
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,780
The fox bird chose the fox bird again.

647
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
Oh my god.

648
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,780
It's another choice that I can't believe.

649
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,780
I hope the fox bird can still be like Zhen Tian.

650
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,780
And take advantage of the advantage of the front-side.

651
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,780
And solve the fight quickly.

652
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
It's starting.

653
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Go, go, go.

654
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,780
Hello, everyone.

655
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,780
This is the last match of the Chinese Championship

656
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
of the World Cup.

657
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,780
Today, we will welcome the ZGDX team

658
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,780
to compete against YQCB.

659
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
The first team of the Chinese Championship,

660
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
the ZGDX team.

661
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
The traditional team,

662
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
the ZGDX team.

663
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,780
The winner of the 700 YQCBs

664
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,780
is the black horse of the Phoenix Night Market.

665
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,780
The ZGDX team in the middle of YQCB

666
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,780
is the winner of the ZGDX team.

667
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,780
Let's wait and see.

668
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,780
Okay.

669
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
Come on, Mr. Zhang.

670
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Okay.

671
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,780
Brother Cheng,

672
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,780
the ice is too deep.

673
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,780
It's not safe.

674
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
Okay.

675
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
Come on, Xiaolu.

676
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,780
It's a retreat.

677
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
The other team is about to be defeated.

678
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,780
Xiaopang, take a look at the game.

679
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,780
The team is very fierce.

680
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,780
They don't want to leave after the ice is gone.

681
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
The one who loses the fox is the ZGDX team.

682
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,780
The one who loses the fox is the ZGDX team.

683
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
The one who loses the fox is the one who wants to beat the front.

684
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,780
He wants to suppress the real rain.

685
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
Since they are so strong,

686
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
it's okay.

687
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
Xiaopang, you go first.

688
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
Ai Jia, you stay in the middle.

689
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
Be careful.

690
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
They are definitely here.

691
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
K comes to the bottom.

692
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,780
Can Qin Feng catch the King of the King?

693
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,780
My god, the King of the King doesn't leave the tower.

694
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,780
Xiaopang's monster skill is always in the bottom.

695
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,780
It's not cheap at all.

696
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
Retreat.

697
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,780
They have a advantage.

698
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
We'll go first

699
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
and then we'll go down together.

700
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
The middle and bottom are not at the advantage.

701
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
It seems that the ZGDX team is a bit difficult.

702
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,780
And the middle and bottom team

703
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,780
are very stable.

704
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,780
There is no advantage in the temple.

705
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,780
It's obvious that

706
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,780
Ai Jia is stable and too stable.

707
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,780
She is ready to drag me into the middle.

708
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,780
What's stable and too stable?

709
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,780
It's obviously the old man's plan.

710
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,780
I can't support him.

711
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,780
It's okay. We have already withdrawn safely.

712
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
You guys go down a bit.

713
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
I'm going to be able to deal with

714
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
Rong Rong's Qin Fang's idea.

715
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,780
I'm finally being tied up by Ai Jia's dog-nose.

716
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,780
He moved all the strength

717
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,780
he usually has to keep.

718
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,780
I can't find a chance at all.

719
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
I have the skill.

720
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
I'll go catch them.

721
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
Xiaopang's operation is still in time.

722
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Everyone, be careful.

723
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
Okay.

724
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
It's only a few minutes.

725
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
You're all in a hurry.

726
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Xiaolu, don't force your head with them.

727
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Brother Cheng.

728
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,780
You can do it.

729
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,780
Don't be anxious.

730
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,780
Push back.

731
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
Push back.

732
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,780
Xiaopang,

733
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Xiaopang,

734
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
control the pig's head.

735
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
Okay.

736
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
He's got two people's head.

737
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Okay, Brother Cheng.

738
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
Nice.

739
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
The captain is helping.

740
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,780
This is not bad.

741
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
It's not bad to call Huang.

742
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
We've earned 260 yuan.

743
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
I think you should lower it.

744
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
Lower it a bit.

745
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
It's a pity.

746
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,780
The monster and the eagle are also in danger.

747
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,780
My support won't die.

748
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
Xiaopang,

749
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
the monster is not in danger.

750
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
The monster is in danger.

751
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,780
Double-clutch.

752
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
Double-clutch.

753
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
The captain is in danger.

754
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,780
The captain of the captain is in danger.

755
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Xiaolu suddenly became 2.2 meters from 1 to 0.

756
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
The two sides' economy is back to normal.

757
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,780
It seems that the leader of the path is still unknown.

758
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,780
The captain is in danger.

759
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
Is it necessary?

760
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
I think it's because of Brother Cheng's talent.

761
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
It's not difficult to call him.

762
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,780
It's too hard to call Huang.

763
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,780
It must be from the back.

764
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,780
You're always like this.

765
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,780
We can see that the Chessmen are still in the lower line.

766
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
At this time...

767
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,780
Turn around. I'm going to be in danger.

768
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
Let's go.

769
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Go.

770
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
Chessmen is in danger.

771
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
Xiaopang is blocked.

772
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
The two sides are starting to retreat.

773
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,780
They can't move.

774
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
Can they move?

775
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
It's so dangerous.

776
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
It's scary.

777
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
Chessmen's back is too dangerous.

778
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,780
Brother Cheng, hurry up and go back to the main line.

779
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
If you press like this,

780
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
I'll be in trouble.

781
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
Brother Cheng's demon tiger

782
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
should be back to the main line.

783
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
The ice is coming.

784
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,780
The Chessmen must be going to eat the gold.

785
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
Cheng Wubu is on the line.

786
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Don't leave the Chessmen.

787
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
Just follow him.

788
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
The ice is coming.

789
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Take the ice away.

790
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
No. Chessmen is not leaving.

791
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,780
The Xiaohuang will be back soon.

792
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
Xiaolu is in danger.

793
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,780
The Chessmen are still there.

794
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,780
Xiaohuang and Liangzhen are all very healthy.

795
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
Be careful.

796
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
The ice is coming.

797
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
The ice is coming.

798
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
The Xiaohuang is coming.

799
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
The K is coming.

800
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,780
We'll push him up.

801
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
Don't be greedy.

802
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
Don't be too anxious.

803
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
Don't be too anxious.

804
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Fortunately, they are not fast.

805
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
They are not.

806
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
The K is coming.

807
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
The cat is going up.

808
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,780
The cat is going up.

809
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,780
The K is coming.

810
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Can you save the cat?

811
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,780
The cat is attacked.

812
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,780
The K is not in danger.

813
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,780
The dragon is coming.

814
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
The Chessmen are gone.

815
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
Call you here early.

816
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
The Xiaohuang is coming.

817
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
He is trying to catch the gold.

818
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
I don't want to be in danger.

819
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
You can come out later.

820
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,780
The second round is too weak.

821
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,780
Honestly,

822
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,780
the situation of ZGDX is not easy to get.

823
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
The game has been started for 11 minutes.

824
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,780
The difference in both sides is 1,300 yuan.

825
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,780
The YQCB is temporarily in the lead.

826
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,780
See?

827
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
The ZGDX team

828
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,780
is very sad about the top and bottom.

829
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,780
Look at the Xiaohuang.

830
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,780
He just pushed the Chessmen down.

831
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
He didn't give him a chance.

832
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
He can't even throw the ice.

833
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
He can't walk.

834
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
Now,

835
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
the ZGDX team

836
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,780
is normal in the team.

837
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
Only in the

838
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
team with the same team

839
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
is the MiaoLin.

840
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
Yes.

841
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
We can only hope for him.

842
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
We hope he can

843
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
get out of the blue.

844
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Come on. Let's fight him.

845
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
Hurry up.

846
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
Brother Teng, they are fighting the game.

847
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
The game is over.

848
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
Go and throw the gold.

849
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
I will try.

850
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,780
Xiaoqi, the mountain path is open.

851
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,780
The ZGDX is behind.

852
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
The ZGDX is in danger.

853
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
No. The ZGDX is too fast.

854
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
He can't throw the gold.

855
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
I will go down.

856
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
Take a break.

857
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
I will hit him.

858
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
It's not that hard.

859
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
I will make the後.

860
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
Be careful. Don't let them break the game.

861
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
They don't have a big house.

862
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,780
Maomao,

863
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,780
go and check on the tower.

864
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
I will go.

865
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780
I will go.

866
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
It's not that hard.

867
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
The ZGDX is behind.

868
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
The ZGDX is down.

869
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
The enemy team

870
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
is still not out yet.

871
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
I will try to shoot the big one.

872
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
I can also shoot him.

873
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
The ZGDX will come out.

874
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
He can't get out.

875
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,780
He can't get out.

876
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,780
He can't get out.

877
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
The ZGDX is out.

878
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
The ZGDX is out.

879
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
The ZGDX is out.

880
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
The tower will be gone.

881
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
They can't guard.

882
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
They must give it.

883
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,780
They can't let them go.

884
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Yes, continue.

885
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,780
The baron went out.

886
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,780
Look, the enemy is taking the WCB.

887
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
The only one left is the school.

888
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
The WCB is out.

889
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
The WCB is out.

890
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,780
The WCB is out.

891
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
The WCB is out.

892
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
The enemy is out.

893
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
The enemy is out.

894
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
The WCB is out.

895
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
The enemy is out.

896
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
The WCB is out.

897
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,780
The WCB is out.

898
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,780
The WCB is out.

899
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,780
The WCB is out.

900
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,780
But I don't think there will be such a situation again.

901
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,780
The WCB will take the lesson.

902
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
Protect the enemy's output.

903
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,780
If the WCB wants to kill the enemy again,

904
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
it won't be easy.

905
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Yes, I hope the WCB can take this opportunity.

906
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,780
Finally, the baron is out.

907
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,780
The captain is taking the lesson.

908
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
Where are you going?

909
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,780
What do you want to withdraw?

910
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,780
Why are you taking the lesson?

911
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Brother Cheng.

912
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
Why are you taking the lesson?

913
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,780
Why are you taking the lesson?

914
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
They seem to withdraw.

915
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
No.

916
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Don't take this lesson.

917
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,780
They must take the lesson.

918
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,780
Everyone is going to take the lesson after the fire.

919
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,780
Brother Cheng.

920
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,780
It's too dangerous to take the lesson at this time.

921
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,780
If you don't continue to push the lesson at this time,

922
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,780
it's not enough time.

923
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,780
They are already on fire.

924
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,780
Let's withdraw.

925
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,780
Let's withdraw.

926
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,780
We can't finish it, Brother Cheng.

927
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,780
Brother Cheng, withdraw.

928
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,780
What are you doing?

929
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,780
Brother Cheng, they are coming.

930
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
We can do it.

931
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,780
Let's open the big scene.

932
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
I'll throw the fire.

933
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,780
The enemy is not alive.

934
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,780
We can't get the back car in this situation.

935
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,780
Brother Cheng.

936
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,780
Brother Cheng actually took the lesson.

937
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,780
It's really a historical moment.

938
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,780
Brother Cheng, I can't hold it.

939
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,780
I can't hold it.

940
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,780
What should we do?

941
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,780
Let's move.

942
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
Go.

943
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
Let's move.

944
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
Go.

945
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,780
Who is the enemy?

946
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,780
I'm hanging up.

947
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
What a pity.

948
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,780
The Chessmen are just a little bit close.

949
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,780
If we were to call the king,

950
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,780
we wouldn't know what the result would be.

951
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,780
It's obvious.

952
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,780
This is a command room of the Chessmen.

953
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,780
Yes.

954
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,780
How could we let Zhong Dan go to the group?

955
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,780
Think about it.

956
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Zhong Dan can be in the group.

957
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Where is he?

958
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,780
How could we fight him?

959
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
Yes.

960
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Nice.

961
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Nice.

962
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
That was too cool.

963
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,780
Xia Er.

964
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
You have to.

965
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,780
What?

966
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,780
Brother Cheng.

967
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,780
Your hand.

968
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
It's okay.

969
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Let's go.

970
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
Brother Cheng.

971
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
Brother Cheng.

972
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,780
Brother Cheng.
