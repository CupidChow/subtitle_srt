1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
and some excuses to avoid the Emperor.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,880
You're against it.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,840
You bastard!

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,560
Come here!

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,160
Bastard!

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,440
At least someone believes

7
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,720
their love in their heart.

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,200
They don't understand

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,040
that love is for them.

10
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
It means something.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,840
Why are you scolding me?

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,240
Come back!

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,480
Don't!

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,680
Get out of the way!

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,560
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,840
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,200
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,960
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,240
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,400
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,040
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,360
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,960
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,560
I'm sorry.

31
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,160
I'm sorry.

32
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,760
I'm sorry.

33
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,600
I'm sorry.

34
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm sorry.

35
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,160
I'm sorry.

36
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm sorry.

37
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,720
I'm sorry.

38
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm sorry.

39
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,240
I'm sorry.

40
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm sorry.

41
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,720
I'm sorry.

42
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,560
I'm sorry.

43
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,400
I'm sorry.

44
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm sorry.

45
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm sorry.

46
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm sorry.

47
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm sorry.

48
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
I'm sorry.

49
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm sorry.

50
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
I'm sorry.

51
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
I'm sorry.

52
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm sorry.

53
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,240
I'm sorry.

86
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm sorry.

87
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
I'm sorry.

88
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Let me have a look, first.

89
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
First...

90
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,240
oome.

91
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
I'm sorry.

92
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:55,240
I really want to have a fight.

93
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,640
We thought of a way to get a better life.

94
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,000
We just got married.

95
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,640
We thought of changing a new house for him.

96
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,520
It's impossible to stay with us for a long time.

97
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,720
You think so?

98
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,520
Yes.

99
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,520
Young people need their own space.

100
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,280
In the past, his old son

101
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,880
had a job.

102
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,680
Now he can't even work.

103
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,880
He can't find a job.

104
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,640
All the things he does at home

105
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
need money.

106
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,280
Where do we go to get money?

107
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,200
Yes.

108
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,480
We know

109
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,960
it's not easy to have a son.

110
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,560
What's not easy?

111
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,240
His brother is in the countryside.

112
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,480
He can't afford to pay.

113
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,880
Now his brother is in the middle of the night.

114
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,440
He needs a house.

115
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,480
We just need money.

116
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,040
He doesn't want to pay.

117
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,320
He doesn't answer the phone.

118
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,520
He can't even see the people.

119
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,200
Think about it.

120
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,320
He doesn't answer the phone.

121
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,480
We are his parents.

122
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
He doesn't answer the phone.

123
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,960
You can see it.

124
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,040
We are not afraid of it.

125
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,280
Hua said it again.

126
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
If we have a way,

127
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,200
I won't come here to see him.

128
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,680
You are the one who is playing the game.

129
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,560
I am.

130
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
You are also playing.

131
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,040
I just want to make sure

132
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
he can win the game

133
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,960
and win the game.

134
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Well,

135
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,240
we signed an contract with the team member.

136
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,040
The company is confidential.

137
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,840
According to the law,

138
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,240
he should tell you.

139
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,280
It's not convenient for me.

140
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
I am not stupid.

141
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,520
I am his old man.

142
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,280
His things are all given by his mother.

143
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,840
Yes.

144
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,080
I just want to make sure

145
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,320
he can win the game

146
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,240
and earn a lot of money.

147
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,920
Well,

148
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,640
it's really not convenient for me.

149
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Stop talking.

150
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
This is all the savings I have saved

151
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,200
since I started playing.

152
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,440
Except for the money I give you every month,

153
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,080
and my daily expenses,

154
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
all the other things are here.

155
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,480
Take them all.

156
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,000
Do whatever you want.

157
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,200
Go to build a house for him.

158
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,760
Pay the money and pay the father.

159
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Go to the gambling and gambling.

160
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
Don't use so many reasons.

161
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,320
All of these are yours now.

162
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,320
Dad.

163
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,000
Mom.

164
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,480
I really appreciate your kindness.

165
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,080
But please don't come to the base again.

166
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,680
Don't bother me again.

167
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,400
And don't bother my teammates here.

168
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,800
Go away.

169
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,840
What are you doing?

170
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,080
Get out of the way.

171
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,400
Brother Rui.

172
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Please help them

173
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
to order the tickets back.

174
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,200
I will go to the next month's company.

175
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,760
Look at this.

176
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,880
It's not like it's going to be a deal.

177
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,280
It's so beautiful.

178
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,800
I will go to the next month's company.

179
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,800
I will go to the next month's company.

180

I will go to the next month's company.

182
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,960
I will go to the next month's company.

183
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,120
I will go to the next month's company.

184
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,400
I will go to the next month's company.

185
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600

I will go to the next month's company.

193
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,040
I will go toровeta.

194
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,040
I will go to the next month's company.

195
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
I will go to the next month's company.

196
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,520
I will go to the next month's company.

197
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
I will go to the next month's company.

198
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,720
I will go to the next month's company.

199
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,120
I will go to the next month's company.

200
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
I'm afraid that something is wrong.

201
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
From a young age,

202
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
I did everything wrong.

203
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
I did everything right.

204
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
I wanted to study, but I didn't want to be that kind of person.

205
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I wanted to learn to work with my dad.

206
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
I didn't want to go to school.

207
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
I didn't want to go to school.

208
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
I was a little bit too young to go to school.

209
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
I also learned to play games at that time.

210
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I helped others to pay for the money.

211
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Tong Yao, do you know that?

212
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Actually, at that time, I didn't like to play games at all.

213
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
I just thought that it was just a tool to make money.

214
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
If I hadn't met the god of fame,

215
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I might not know what the electronic economy is in my life.

216
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I understand that I'm in love with him.

217
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,280
But I still only have a special tool to treat my parents.

218
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Actually, you can understand that.

219
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,280
The person they are talking to needs communication.

220
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
My parents are the same.

221
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Didn't you also meet them?

222
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Tong Yao,

223
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
we are different.

224
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
We are different.

225
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Why are you different?

226
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Your parents are very good.

227
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
They love you very much.

228
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
But I...

229
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
So now, except for the electronic economy,

230
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
I really have nothing.

231
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
You still have us?

232
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Tong Yao.

233
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm sorry.

234
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I was right about you.

235
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,280
And your parents came to remember the words I said.

236
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
It's been so long.

237
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Why do you still remember?

238
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I've forgotten.

239
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Let's go, okay?

240
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Let's go back to the base.

241
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Okay.

242
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

243
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Sister, I'm in a rush.

244
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
What's wrong?

245
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Come, I'll take you to see.

246
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Look at this.

247
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
What is this?

248
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
The ancient power of YQCB, the transfer of the sound.

249
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
What is this?

250
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
The ancient power of YQCB, the transfer of the sound.

251
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
The transfer of the sound.

252
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
The transfer of the sound?

253
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
You really bought YQCB?

254
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Of course, it's true.

255
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm the one who made it.

256
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Boss, you bought the microchip.

257
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
What do you want?

258
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Taozi,

259
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
he really bought your team?

260
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Of course.

261
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,280
He is our boss and manager.

262
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Well...

263
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Is this reasonable?

264
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Yes, I've thought about it.

265
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Although I'm not good at games,

266
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
I'm not good at this industry.

267
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
But I'm smart.

268
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
I can learn everything.

269
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
And I also think that

270
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
the telecom industry is really good.

271
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
My dad also thinks that

272
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
this is a very potential investment.

273
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
My wife is still smart.

274
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
That's right.

275
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
I'll go to digest this news first.

276
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Don't go.

277
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I have something to discuss with you.

278
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
What is it?

279
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Didn't you tell me last time

280
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
about the thing that K's parents came to the base?

281
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
I found out later that

282
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
many parents are like his parents.

283
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
They think that playing games is a game.

284
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
They think that

285
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
they can earn a lot of money easily.

286
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
That's what the family thought.

287
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Don't cue me.

288
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Although I used to like playing games,

289
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
since I started my career,

290
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
I think it's too hard.

291
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
It's just that

292
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
there's no such thing as good things.

293
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,280
You can play and make money easily.

294
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Many people can't see the pain and pressure

295
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
behind the professional players.

296
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
That's why there are so many parents

297
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
who don't understand

298
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
how to play games.

299
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Sister, you've grown up.

300
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Of course.

301
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Do you think I'm just a boss

302
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
who can be responsible for the future?

303
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
And since I bought the team,

304
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
I always have an idea.

305
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I must do something for the team.

306
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,280
So I have a special idea now.

307
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
You...

308
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
You want to sell ZGDX, right?

309
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
And then you can buy it all?

310
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
I don't have that much money.

311
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm planning to

312
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
make a family with you

313
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
and Aijia.

314
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Family and Aijia?

315
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
What are we going to do?

316
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
We're going to go to the activities

317
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
next door.

318
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Because it's my and Aijia's mother's school.

319
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
So I must go.

320
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
It's not good.

321
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
We've arranged it so late recently.

322
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
We didn't agree with Brother Cheng

323
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
last time.

324
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
He must be going this time.

325
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Family and Aijia?

326
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Sister,

327
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
your mother's candy is excellent.

328
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
It's a lie.

329
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Family and Aijia?

330
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
It's a performance.

331
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
A performance?

332
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Second,

333
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
this is a performance

334
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
with a positive and lively atmosphere.

335
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Look at you.

336
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
You're all so cute.

337
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
You're training every day.

338
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
You're not just eating and drinking.

339
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
You're just dry and rough.

340
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
What's the charm?

341
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Tong Yao,

342
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
your skin hasn't been in a good condition recently.

343
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
It's fine.

344
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
I used a small water-cooled mask.

345
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
The water-cooling effect is excellent.

346
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
You should try it.

347
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Come on.

348
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Go back and try it yourself.

349
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Okay.

350
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I'll go back and try it.

351
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
I believe you can

352
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
use a very perfect state

353
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
to face everyone.

354
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Today,

355
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
we've invited two famous

356
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
electronic teams,

357
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
ZGDX and YQCB,

358
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
two limited-edition members

359
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
to our event today.

360
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Now,

361
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
let's give them a warm applause.

362
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Welcome the manager of YQCB,

363
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Chen Jingyang and Shijie.

364
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Shige, Aijia.

365
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Shijie, Tong Yao, come on in.

366
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Okay, please sit down.

367
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Okay, it's our interaction time.

368
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Which one of you

369
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
would like to ask Shige

370
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
if she can help her?

371
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Okay, this girl.

372
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Hello, Shijie.

373
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
I'd like to ask you, Tong Yao.

374
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Do you like playing games?

375
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Is it because of your game?

376
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Or because of

377
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
your boyfriend?

378
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Yes.

379
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
He's the one

380
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
who brought me into the world of games.

381
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
But I'm the one

382
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
who took the electronic system

383
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
as my job and dream.

384
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
So, in a relationship,

385
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
if you like playing games

386
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
but you hate them,

387
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
does that mean

388
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
they're destined to be together?

389
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Yes.

390
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
I'll answer this question.

391
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
I believe

392
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
there won't be

393
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
two people in this world

394
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
who are exactly the same.

395
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Especially between lovers.

396
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Just like me and my family.

397
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
One is

398
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
the professional player

399
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
who has forgotten to charge

400
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
for the finals.

401
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
The other is

402
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
the one who only knows how to buy skin care products.

403
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
He doesn't even know

404
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
what equipment he's going to buy.

405
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
He's a three-year-old girl.

406
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
I really don't like playing games.

407
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm just like many girls.

408
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
I don't understand

409
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
how many hours

410
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I'll be able to play games

411
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
in front of the computer

412
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
in a few hours.

413
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Of course,

414
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
I don't understand

415
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
what's going on in my family.

416
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
He doesn't understand

417
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
why I only have two legs

418
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
and two pairs of shoes.

419
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I only have one mouth

420
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
and five hundred inches.

421
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
And they're all the same.

422
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
But he'll keep it secret.

423
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Even if he

424
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
has been

425
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
on the computer for more than ten hours,

426
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
he'll know

427
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
that I've changed my hairstyle

428
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
and dyed my hair.

429
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
My clothes

430
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
are prettier than yesterday.

431
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
He's always been

432
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
so concerned about me.

433
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
He'll never

434
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
get away with the game.

435
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
So I'm the same.

436
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
I don't understand games.

437
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
But I know

438
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
the computer is a kind of physical spirit.

439
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
It's not a game

440
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
that's hidden in the world.

441
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
It's just a different form.

442
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
It's like a person

443
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
who's in control of his strength.

444
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Just like now,

445
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
my taste

446
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
has increased greatly.

447
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
And I

448
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
have found

449
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
a way to improve my career.

450
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Okay.

451
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
I have another question for you.

452
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
This girl.

453
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
I'd like to ask

454
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
how did you

455
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
become the leader of the capital city

456
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
and also

457
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
can monitor your studies

458
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
and get a good graduate?

459
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
I think it's time to arrange it.

460
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
What's your identity?

461
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
What do you think you're the priority?

462
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
If you're a student,

463
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
you have to complete all the studies

464
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
in the right time

465
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
in the right time.

466
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,780
You can't

467
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,780
make any excuses.

468
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
So when I'm a student,

469
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I'll study harder.

470
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Because I don't want

471
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
those who don't understand the computer

472
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
say that

473
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
playing games

474
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
is just a game.

475
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Of course,

476
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
now everyone has more

477
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
and more understanding.

478
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
There's less misunderstanding.

479
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
According to the data,

480
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
in the last year,

481
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
the world

482
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
has seen

483
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
tens of thousands of people.

484
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
This data

485
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
has exceeded

486
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
many traditional economic projects.

487
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
We also know that

488
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
now

489
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
more and more schools

490
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
such as Chinese and American universities

491
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
have started

492
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
to become professional

493
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
and to provide

494
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
professional talents

495
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
in the future.

496
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Yes.

497
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,280
So I'm very grateful to my good sister, Jin Yang,

498
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
for giving me the chance to be a part of this family.

499
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Yan Hua, we hope that

500
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
everyone can get to know

501
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
more about

502
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
the relationship between

503
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
professional players

504
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
and the electronic economy.

505
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
We will also work hard

506
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
to change some of our players' opinions

507
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
and make China more competitive.

508
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Let the world see

509
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
the power of our Chinese players.

510
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Okay, this is Nan.

511
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
Hello, everyone.

512
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I'm your fan.

513
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
When I was in school,

514
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
I heard about you a lot.

515
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
I want to know

516
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
how you don't know the electronic economy.

517
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
You even know how to play cards.

518
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
How did you

519
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
continue to play cards?

520
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
When you were alone,

521
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
you thought about giving up

522
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
when you were against everyone.

523
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
I...

524
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
I...

525
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
never thought about giving up.

526
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
But I did

527
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
hurt my family

528
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
because of the passion

529
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,280
for the game.

530
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
My experience

531
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
is like a little bastard

532
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
who doesn't follow the rules

533
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
and is self-conscious.

534
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I give up on the player

535
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
and leave the house.

536
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
You're leaving, aren't you?

537
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Go.

538
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
You've grown up anyway.

539
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
You're too stubborn.

540
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
You won't win

541
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
whatever mom says.

542
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
You'll know

543
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
how to play games

544
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
when you're done.

545
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
I've told you many times.

546
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Have you heard of it?

547
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Tell me.

548
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
What's the advantage

549
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
of playing games?

550
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
What's the contribution

551
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
of this society?

552
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
This is my favorite thing.

553
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
I won't give up.

554
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Mom,

555
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
can't you understand me?

556
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
I understand you.

557
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
What do I understand?

558
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
I'm a teacher.

559
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
I've taught so many children.

560
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
How can I not teach you well?

561
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I'll ask you one more time.

562
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Are you going to play games?

563
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Yes.

564
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Okay.

565
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Get out of here.

566
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Don't come back

567
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
after you leave.

568
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
So

569
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
since I started my career,

570
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I've told myself

571
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
I won't go home

572
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
without success.

573
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
I want everyone to know

574
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
that not all the rules

575
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
are wrong.

576
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I can take responsibility

577
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
for my own choice.

578
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
I know

579
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
in real life,

580
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
many people don't understand

581
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
our career.

582
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
They think that

583
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
the electric circle is to mix up

584
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
and play games.

585
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
It's not different from online games.

586
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Everyone

587
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
may only see

588
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
the live broadcast

589
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
and the fans' crazy

590
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
and those tens of millions of years of money.

591
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
But I want to ask

592
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
is this true?

593
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Just like all sports projects,

594
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
the electric circle

595
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
is the opponent

596
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
of all top players.

597
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
And these top players

598
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
who have experienced training,

599
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
magic and resistance,

600
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
they are definitely

601
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
not as simple as any sports project.

602
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
They are not as bad as them.

603
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Some seniors once said

604
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
our world

605
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
is as cruel as other sports projects.

606
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Because there are too many cases of failure.

607
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
There are talented people

608
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
who can't be beaten.

609
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Those who are beaten

610
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
can't be remembered.

611
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
If you are remembered,

612
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
you can't have a good result.

613
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
So those professional players

614
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
have put more effort

615
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
into their work.

616
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Their efforts

617
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
have determined their performance.

618
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Just like everyone

619
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
is promoted,

620
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
be criticized

621
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
and be praised.

622
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
If you fail,

623
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
will you regret

624
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
playing games?

625
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Although the electronic economy is a game,

626
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
the process of success

627
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
is not a game.

628
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I tried,

629
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
even if I failed,

630
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
I don't regret it.

631
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Youth is not an excuse

632
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
to make mistakes.

633
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
But youth

634
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
is indeed the only thing.

635
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Decide to do it

636
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
and you will have the determination to go back.

637
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Okay, students.

638
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
The champion of this year's competition

639
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
has begun.

640
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
The final will be held in Shanghai.

641
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
This is a great honor.

642
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Please cheer for the senior sisters.

643
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Cheer for China.

644
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
Where is Jin Yang?

645
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
He is still busy.

646
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Let's go first.

647
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Why are you in a hurry?

648
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
You are too polite.

649
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
Hello, Mr. Lin.

650
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
When you graduated,

651
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
you said you didn't know

652
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
what you were suitable for.

653
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
It's been less than a year.

654
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
You are still busy.

655
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
You are still busy.

656
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
I'm busy.

657
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm busy.

658
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
I'm busy.

659
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
I'm busy.

660
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
I'm busy.

661
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
You are so excellent

662
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
that you are not in time.

663
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
You are all invited back to the speech.

664
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
No.

665
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
It's all because of Jin Yang and Ai Jia.

666
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Ai Jia.

667
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Mom.

668
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
I didn't expect you would come.

669
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Jin Yang asked me to come.

670
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
He and I have been talking for a long time.

671
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
About you,

672
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
about the mirror,

673
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
about your career.

674
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
I thought I wouldn't come.

675
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Jin Yang convinced me.

676
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Actually,

677
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
I still don't understand

678
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
what you said about the mirror,

679
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
the club,

680
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
but I know a little bit.

681
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
My son has grown up.

682
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,280
He can also make the right choice

683
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
for his own life.

684
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
I believe he will succeed

685
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
when he grows up.

686
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
I have class.

687
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
I have to go.

688
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Aunt.

689
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Mom.

690
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I haven't been back to school for a long time.

691
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
How about

692
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
I take a walk with you?

693
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Okay.

694
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Come.

695
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Let's go.

696
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
You go.

697
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
You go.

698
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
I'll wait for you here.

699
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
If you have time tomorrow,

700
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
can you come back to see your dad?

701
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Take Jin Yang with you.

702
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Let's have a meal together.

703
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Say it again.

704
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Are you that busy?

705
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
I have to make money.

706
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Right?

707
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
If one day,

708
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
my photos are on the wall,

709
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
it's done.

710
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Don't worry.

711
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Everything you want will come.

712
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
It's a bomb.

713
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
It's a big news.

714
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Let's go.

715
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Hurry up.

716
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
I'm going to the club.

717
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
I'm going to the club.

718
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Let's go.

719
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
What's wrong?

720
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
Did the double C of VGDX

721
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
get better?

722
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I didn't think it was right.

723
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
As a girl,

724
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
I think I can't lie to others.

725
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Let me see.

726
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
This one.

727
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,280
The first time I mentioned Dong Yao in the MVP interview,

728
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Lu Si Cheng said that he was very good.

729
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Very good.

730
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
He was hot-skinned,

731
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
and has a soft-skinned face.

732
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
He was simple and smiling.

733
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
So cool.

734
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Dong Yao is a little fat.

735
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
But he's not bad.

736
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
The classic move

737
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
that Lu Si Cheng made

738
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
is not suitable for him.

739
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Look at this.

740
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Look.

741
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
The first time I went to the movie,

742
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
two fans were doing the same thing.

743
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
They were watching Lu Si Cheng

744
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,280
and the fans were so fast.

745
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
They were so passionate.

746
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
So cool.

747
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
So cool.

748
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
So cool.

749
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
What are you looking at?

750
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Did you search the movie about the movie?

751
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
No.

752
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
I'll show you the photos.

753
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
It's all my fault.

754
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
My god.

755
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
I was so passionate

756
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
about the good thing in the Chinese New Year.

757
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
How can I get it?

758
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
When did our team

759
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
start to become friends?

760
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
The manager said

761
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
no one would notify me.

762
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Dong Yao,

763
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
what's going on?

764
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Why do our team

765
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
know

766
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
more than the net friends

767
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
in the competition?

768
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
When did you all start

769
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
to do these little moves?

770
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
You could play it

771
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
by thinking and counting.

772
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
But they can't trick you.

773
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,400
and I can not control myself.

774
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,380
And I...

775
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,020
What are you staring at?

776
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,700
Wang You look 34 years old for the first time!

777
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,180
So, we must be fine together.

778
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,500
Oh, he only laughs at me.

779
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,440
Dong Yang,

780
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
tell me come on.

781
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,900
Long time ago, Netizens in the anime taboo about the delicious smile.

782
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,980
Look, it's him.

783
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,940
Are you sure?

784
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,820
Look, he even plays combos of happyukanremoto.

785
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,180
Now he came at me!

786
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,120
My god!

787
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,220
I admit that.

788
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,080
I'm going to vomit.

789
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,280
I'm going to give it to my mom.

790
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,200
The next day,

791
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
it's the season when your eldest son

792
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,720
was born.

793
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,880
He hid the number of years.

794
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,000
This year, it's probably...

795
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,040
What are you guys arguing about?

796
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,000
Don't let people sleep.

797
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,920
Jing Qianyang often said

798
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,360
you love Tong Yao.

799
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,080
He said we're a dog.

800
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,080
No.

801
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,240
The director said

802
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,320
you can see Tong Yao

803
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,880
from your eyes.

804
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,000
Tong Yao is watching the game.

805
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,240
You're peeking at her.

806
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,120
Yes.

807
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I'm in the dark.

808
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
I'm bored.

809
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,520
Isn't it just a joke?

810
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,080
No one is serious about you being together.

811
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,400
My mom is already helpless.

812
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,760
Don't worry.

813
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm here.

814
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,080
I can rest.

815
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,880
We're home.

816
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
I'm feeling such a bad head ache.

817
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,000
I know.

818
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,840
Okay.

819
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,640
Please玩 Play.

820
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,960
As viewers,

821
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,720
you've all been watching

822
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,440
our Palestinians restaurant

823
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,600
at daybreak,

824
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,440
I'm going to work.

825
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,000
Look, it's Chen Lu.

826
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,600
Where's the face?

827
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,160
Is there a new episode of the TV show?

828
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,400
This...

829
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,360
The mouth...

830
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,440
The air suddenly calmed down.

831
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,840
I forgot what I was going to say.

832
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,760
But these people are really good at it.

833
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,840
It's so embarrassing.

834
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,680
What are you doing?

835
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Didn't you say you didn't want to improve your strength?

836
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,240
I...

837
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,800
That's just...

838
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,640
I'm sure I won't be able to see

839
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,160
the game after the game.

840
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,640
There are many players who will play

841
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,480
and put the F on the table.

842
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,080
Taofen.

843
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,120
Yes.

844
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,200
But if there are some

845
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,640
unexpected news,

846
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
I'll pay attention to it.

847
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,080
After all,

848
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,120
as an actor,

849
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,800
I can't be too late, right?

850
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,360
I'm really a little kid.

851
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,280
At the same time,

852
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,880
the organization is too big.

853
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,400
How will we play in the future?

854
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,840
The play is about to begin.

855
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,880
It's time to start.

856
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,640
Yao He.

857
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,240
Okay.

858
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,680
Isn't that Lu Si Cheng?

859
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,560
ZGDX came to see you today.

860
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,360
Mr. Jiang.

861
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,600
The Spring Games

862
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,440
is so exciting.

863
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,840
Mr. Jiang.

864
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,760
I have to remind you today.

865
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,440
You have to be steady today.

866
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,320
I know the environment

867
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,400
that I'm in ZGDX's consideration today.

868
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,320
It's not!?

869
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,160
It's not just a matter of playing.

870
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,600
I figured out

871
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,040
that we're going to play

872
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,280
overüyor today.

873
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,480
Yes.

874
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,800
Let's make an exception.

875
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,080
We're not going to play either.

876
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,080
You can't even marry me, right?

877
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I shouldn't be here today.

878
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
What? You're talking about me?

879
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,080
What's wrong with you?

880
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
What are you waiting for?

881
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
You're a thief.

882
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,080
You're a fool.

883
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
You're a fool.

884
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
You're a fool.

885
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
You're a fool.

886
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
You're a fool.

887
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
You're a fool.

888
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
You're a fool.

889
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
You're a fool.

890
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
You're a fool.

891
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
You're a fool.

892
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
You're a fool.

893
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
You're a fool.

894
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
You're a fool.

895
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
You're a fool.

896
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
You're a fool.

897
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
You're a fool.

898
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,080
You're a fool.

899
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
You're a fool.

900
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
You're a fool.

901
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
You're a fool.

902
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
You're a fool.

903
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
You're a fool.

904
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
You're a fool.

905
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080
You're a fool.

906
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,080
You're a fool.

907
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,080
You're a fool.

908
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
You're a fool.

909
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
You're a fool.

910
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
You're a fool.

911
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
You're a fool.

912
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
You're a fool.

913
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,080
You're a fool.

914
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,080
You're a fool.

915
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,080
You're a fool.

916
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,080
You're a fool.

917
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,080
You're a fool.

918
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,080
You're a fool.

919
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,080
You're a fool.

920
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,720
Wang Jing'an!

921
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,760
Wang Jing'an!

922
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,320
No one to defend for too early!

923
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,000
What, what is going on?

924
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,600
We didn't finish their scouting.

925
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,160
Mom, look!

926
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,400
It shows that

927
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,360
we're in love.

928
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,160
They're all on my side.

929
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,480
Stop all your bulls,

930
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,960
Another designs for Junekyun.

931
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,560
Last designs.

932
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Okay, let's talk about it later.

933
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,600
Before the game began,

934
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,440
we found that the camera has captured

935
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,840
the ADC Lu Si Cheng and Zhong Dan Tong Yao,

936
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,160
who are from ZGDX.

937
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,120
They are both in a tight fit

938
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,440
and have been training hard.

939
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,760
The person in charge of this game

940
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,080
is surprisingly good.

941
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,520
And the CK Danyang on the stage

942
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,720
is also defeated by this weapon.

943
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,480
You're amazing, my sister.

944
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,760
If it's me today,

945
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,200
I'll definitely blow up my grandson.

946
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,240
Back then,

947
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,840
your grandpa and your grandma

948
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,040
were under heavy pressure.

949
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,320
I'm so sure.

950
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,280
Don't blow up.

951
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,760
I guess my parents are about to

952
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,360
kill the villa soon.

953
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,760
What do you think of them?

954
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,200
What can I say?

955
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,800
My mom is so stupid.

956
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,440
She asked me if I was here to work

957
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,040
or to be a director.

958
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,000
And my four-year-old roommate

959
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,560
said she wanted to fight with me.

960
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,000
As soon as you started the game,

961
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,320
you suddenly fell in love with a man.

962
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,000
I didn't tell everyone.

963
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,680
Of course, you can easily fall in love.

964
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,800
You're still laughing?

965
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,040
What should I do?

966
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,960
What should I do?

967
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,240
I'll join the group.

968
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,960
Or I'll wait for Mrs. Lu

969
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,720
to hit 5 million on your head

970
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,000
and let you leave her son.

971
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,200
I didn't want to make a comeback.

972
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,920
I knew it would be a big deal.

973
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,360
What if something happens in the game?

974
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,320
What if I get hit again?

975
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,040
What if Lu Si Cheng's fans jump off the building?

976
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
You're in love with someone.

977
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,240
Why are you worried about others?

978
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,160
Just love Chen.

979
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,000
My sister loves you too.

980
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,680
Look, you're so nice.

981
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm like a heavy shoe.

982
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,840
I'm also a little suspicious.

983
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,640
Are you a computer player?

984
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,080
Falling in love is a bad thing.

985
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,440
You're not starting to fall in love today.

986
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,080
When you started to fall in love,

987
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,440
you didn't have any bad feelings.

988
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,840
You're not doing well.

989
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,560
What?

990
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,800
Such a nice man.

991
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,680
Let's get married.

992
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,000
Get lost.

993
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,560
Let's go.

994
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,000
This will makecido the idea in no time.

995
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Let him do as you like.

996
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,560
Let go.

997
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,940
Are you adding hard work?

998
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,420
Don't you try.

999
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,740
Just try what you have left.

1000
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,520
You all show up as nine boys in school.

1001
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,200
If you don't show up in school,

1002
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,780
I'll not tease you today.

1003
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,840
I'm sorry.

1004
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,520
Control him.

1005
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,440
Shut up.

1006
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,760
Focus on him.

1007
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,240
So annoying.

1008
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,960
Is he having a faculties medicine lately?

1009
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,360
Wake up.

1010
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,160
That's annoying.

1011
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,120
You're blaming me for being wrong.

1012
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,480
That little girl.

1013
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,040
Right.

1014
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,720
That girl is Tong Yao.

1015
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,040
Yes, she looks small,

1016
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,080
but she's already 18 years old.

1017
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,920
She's not a criminal.

1018
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,920
What was that sound?

1019
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,240
I kissed her.

1020
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,880
What?

1021
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,640
You're going to get promoted?

1022
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,560
Why are you doing that?

1023
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,600
Don't scare her.

1024
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,040
What kind of person is she?

1025
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,640
Don't be like your aunt and aunt.

1026
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
If you keep being rude,

1027
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,120
I'll hang up.

1028
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,560
Brother, it's Maba.

1029
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,080
Dad saw it.

1030
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,720
He said he couldn't reach you.

1031
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,440
My brother has been calling for a long time.

1032
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,160
He must be thirsty.

1033
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,960
I'm thirsty, too.

1034
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,720
Come and have a drink with me.

1035
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,480
I miss you.

1036
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm your future uncle.

1037
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,840
You're not in a good mood now.

1038
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,920
You'll have a hard time in the future.

1039
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,960
Brother Rui.

1040
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,280
What are you doing?

1041
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,480
I'm looking for a house for Tong Yao.

1042
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,440
Let her move out.

1043
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,560
You won't see my brother in the future.

1044
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,560
I'll change the door for her.

1045
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,320
It's useless to open the door 100 times.

1046
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,160
That girl will open the door for my brother.

1047
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,400
Will she?

1048
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,760
I see.

1049
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,720
What's wrong?

1050
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,800
My mom said she'd come to Shenzhen.

1051
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1052
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1053
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1054
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1055
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1056
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1057
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1058
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1059
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1060
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1061
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1062
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1063
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1064
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1065
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1066
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1067
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1068
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1069
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1070
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1071
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1072
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
I'll go to Shenzhen.

1073
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,360
Mr. brigand.

1074
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,880
Mrs. Selly.

1075
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,380
Clan Leader is coming in

1076
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,500
See you

1077
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,560
Let me explain

1078
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,320
Very carefully

1079
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,440
Don't move

1080
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,400
Damn it

1081
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,180
ih

1082
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,420
I'll see you off

1083
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,660
Go

1084
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,480
Wait

1085
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,640
do you hear

1086
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,660
10 Hao

1087
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,540
Peake

1088
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,660
Xiaomin

1089
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,820
you

1090
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,620
I'm not a real man. Who's the real one?

1091
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,500
Who's the one who's going to scold me?

1092
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,780
I'm a man. I think Cheng is disappointed.

1093
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,420
I hope he'll be the champion of the national tournament.

1094
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,300
I don't know what he's doing.

1095
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,660
He almost laughed at me.

1096
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,300
He's a pro player.

1097
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,620
He's been playing with Lu Si Cheng for a second.

1098
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,340
He's been eliminated by Qing Ning and Golden Age.

1099
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,620
He's not a pro player. He's a pro player.

1100
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,540
He just wants to lose to Kai Zi.

1101
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,140
He's a bad guy. He just wants to play straight.

1102
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,380
He's a girl. He's a pro player.

1103
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,220
Apologize to him.

1104
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,300
Interesting.

1105
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,580
The victim hasn't spoken.

1106
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,020
You guys should be the victim first.

1107
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,500
Do you have heartbreak?

1108
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,980
Don't be nervous.

1109
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,620
Later, as the team manager,

1110
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,980
I will take the initiative to admit my mistakes.

1111
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,260
Then we will cooperate with each other.

1112
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,180
There will be no problem.

1113
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,220
Coming.

1114
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,140
Li Zi,

1115
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,100
let's go.

1116
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,980
You guys continue meeting.

1117
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,140
You guys continue meeting.

1118
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,060
I'm the one who followed him.

1119
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,060
I also asked for the public opinion.

1120
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,900
I will take the responsibility for all the consequences.

1121
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,940
Well,

1122
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,700
I just had a meeting with the public official department.

1123
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,340
We have made a emergency public opinion plan for this event.

1124
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,500
The competition is about to begin.

1125
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,420
We promise

1126
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,900
we won't affect the competition

1127
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
because of personal problems.

1128
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,820
Don't worry, boss.

1129
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,860
Good morning, Mr. Wang.

1130
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,580
Good morning, Mr. Li.

1131
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,820
You guys come out and explain.

1132
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,100
Wang Youde can't stop scolding me.

1133
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,740
Look,

1134
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,700
he has everything.

1135
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,820
I can't hold it anymore.

1136
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,220
Then why don't you send the public opinion?
