Now it's time for some hardcore 어�い 2020 songコーヒー

00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:18,320
about deer-ginger

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
How to develop

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
The reason why the defense of the normal competition

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
and the loss of the defense of the YQCBD water block

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
are their victory.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Instead, we usually go to the loss

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
and cooperate to appear on the field

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
and support the efficiency of the slow-mo.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
The main thing is to support the growth.

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
It's not good to stand in the same position.

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
But this is my problem.

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
I shouldn't have let you down.

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
The next one is important.

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Cooperate.

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
We can't lose all three ways.

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
We have to defend and they have to ask.

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
We have to be more stable than them.

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Brother Cheng,

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
pay attention to the development.

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Don't let the king of the school have a chance.

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Brother Cheng.

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
I know Li Junhe very well.

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
If Qianqi doesn't hold him back

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
and suppress him to death,

54
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
then we will die in a very bad way.

55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Then we will die in a very bad way.

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,960
This is the reason why you chose to defend the water block.

57
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
What?

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
The front six or seven steps of the monster lake

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
can be used to finish the formation.

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
As long as the rear can't catch the high-pitched method,

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
the team battle can be easily defeated.

62
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
So we have to speed up the battle.

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
You are not talking anymore?

64
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm not talking anymore.

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm not talking anymore.

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm not talking anymore.

67
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm not talking anymore.

68
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm not talking anymore.

69
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm not talking anymore.

70
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
I'm not talking anymore.

71
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
I'm not talking anymore.

72
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm not talking anymore.

73
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm not talking anymore.

74
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm not talking anymore.

75
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm not talking anymore.

76
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
I'm not talking anymore.

77
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm not talking anymore.

78
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
This is the second game of ZGDX's team

79
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
to face YQCB.

80
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm Jiejuo Xiao Fan.

81
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm Jiejuo Chen Yao.

82
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Now we can see that the team members of both teams are ready to go.

83
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,960
First, YQCB has banned the hand of Xiao Xiu.

84
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
The mountain wind and the early rain.

85
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
And ZGDX has banned the light knife,

86
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
the three-shot and the nine points.

87
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Let's see what kind of mid-level

88
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Smearling will choose.

89
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
I guess she will choose the big dog.

90
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
The dog?

91
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
She will choose the girl.

92
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Will she choose the girl?

93
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
To be honest, I don't understand

94
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
when the girl comes out.

95
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
It's YQCB.

96
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Can the girl fight?

97
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
I don't understand.

98
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Brother Cheng, I can do it.

99
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
You want to fight with me?

100
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Brother Cheng, after the girl comes out,

101
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
ZGDX has banned the Smearling.

102
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
What kind of Smearling is this?

103
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
According to the current situation,

104
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Smearling and Qingmu are going down.

105
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
And the middle is the girl.

106
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
The upper is the girl.

107
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
The middle is the girl.

108
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
What kind of world am I in?

109
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I'm a little bit up now.

110
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
It's too difficult for these players.

111
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
I can't speak.

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
I'm a little bit self-sufficient.

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
I won't talk.

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Now we can see that the game has been played for 13 minutes.

115
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
In ZGDX...

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,960
YQCB is too hard to play.

117
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
It's been more than 10 minutes.

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
They are just playing and pushing the line.

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
I don't even get used to it.

120
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
The gold and equipment are almost the same.

121
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
They are waiting for the opportunity.

122
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Now, who is going to lose?

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
And this battle is very confusing.

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Xiaopang, you go give a test.

125
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
I'll come over.

126
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Okay.

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Old K is coming.

128
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
I'm coming, too.

129
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
That's right.

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
You go in.

131
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
What?

132
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
They said they were going to be in the game.

133
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,960
They are actually four players.

134
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
I can't take the opponent's position.

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Chen is already in the game.

136
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
I'll wait for you.

137
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Wait for me.

138
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Don't be impulsive.

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Okay, now we can see that the girl is starting to prepare for the game.

140
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
And this is the girl.

141
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
She's in the game.

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Get ready to go.

143
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
You want to be killed by Smelly in the tower.

144
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
I don't want to sacrifice my archers.

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Miss, are they afraid of you?

146
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Why did you come and they retreated?

147
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
They left when I came.

148
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
I'm so sorry.

149
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
I was so nervous.

150
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,960
YQCB is so reliable.

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
After half a second,

152
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
they can be the captain's leader after a few more tries.

153
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
YQCB is different from the previous team.

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
They are going to fight with us to eat and drink.

155
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
So when the next team is in the game,

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
we must be cautious.

157
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,960
The opponent is a team that is very strong today.

158
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
The support team is stronger.

159
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
It's still the main match.

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
This situation seems to be not very optimistic.

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,960
The next game will be about who is more difficult.

162
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,960
But the game today is like the game of the opposite side.

163
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Aijia, come and see me in the middle.

164
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Call them to the snake.

165
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Okay.

166
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
They will come to steal.

167
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Don't be so fast.

168
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I'll keep my big brother Smelly.

169
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
As long as he comes, I'll kill him.

170
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
YQCB's archers are going to fight with the snake.

171
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
We can't let this snake go.

172
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
The monster and the monster will attack too fast.

173
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I can't get rid of the monster.

174
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
That's right. Let's split up.

175
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
No.

176
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
We can't let this snake go.

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Let's split up.

178
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I'll go to the side and kill the spirit first.

179
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Come on.

180
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
They are so beautiful.

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Do you want to be so fierce?

182
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
They are going to kill me.

183
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
They are going to steal the big snake.

Go to the position.

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960

We can't cut the back and the back.

204
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960

205
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Get out.

206
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
I'll do it.

372
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
I'll do it.

373
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
I'll do it.

374
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I'll do it.

375
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
I'll do it.

376
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
I'll do it.

377
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
I'll do it.

378
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
You can leave me a comment.

379
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
I'll do it.

380
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
It's nothing.

381
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
It's nothing.

382
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
It's just a regular game.

383
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
We'll be asking if we win or not.

384
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
We'll be asking if we win or not.

385
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Right?

386
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Don't be so sad.

387
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Put your heart on it.

388
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
We can analyze

389
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
the reason for the game tomorrow.

390
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
The reason for the game?

391
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Before we go to the finals,

392
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
we should take the other team's position.

393
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Okay?

394
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
What's wrong?

395
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
You don't want me to talk?

396
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Everyone, take a rest early today.

397
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Prepare for the battle tomorrow.

398
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
The battle?

399
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Captain,

400
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
is that all you have to say?

401
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
You have nothing to explain to us?

402
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
What do you want me to say?

403
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Old cat, calm down.

404
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
I said it.

405
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Why do you have to go to the finals every day?

406
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
You don't care about the new god.

407
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
The god told us to fight.

408
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Are you still here?

409
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
You can hear a few words.

410
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
And

411
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
what happened today?

412
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Why don't you play with the little Song?

413
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Why do you take a demon?

414
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Why do you change the god's battle?

415
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
We have a lot of trouble.

416
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Don't you want to say something?

417
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Don't tell me

418
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
that you took a demon

419
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
and made a face for the show.

420
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Before the game,

421
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I heard you talking to the god like this.

422
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Old cat.

423
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Brother Cheng,

424
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
I just need an explanation.

425
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Before the game,

426
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Brother Cheng looked for me alone.

427
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
God,

428
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
I can't get the little Song this time.

429
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Let me take the demon tiger.

430
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
We don't have time to train new tactics now.

431
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
At least tell me why.

432
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Why not?

433
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
I don't want to take the stone god.

434
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
The demon can control the king.

435
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
If we don't let him develop,

436
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
we may be able to finish the game as soon as possible.

437
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
What is the reason for you to finish the game as soon as possible?

438
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
I remember I've told you before.

439
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
This is a battle.

440
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
It's a long battle.

441
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
We have to fight with patience and strength.

442
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
God,

443
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
I can't finish the game.

444
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Give me an explanation.

445
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
No explanation.

446
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
The little Song is mine.

447
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Before the game, Brother Cheng told me

448
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
that he wanted to take the demon tiger.

449
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
But Brother Cheng,

450
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I need an explanation.

451
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
You all misunderstood.

452
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Brother Cheng

453
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
actually got hurt again.

454
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Your hand got hurt.

455
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
So Brother Cheng wanted to fight with patience and strength.

456
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Brother Cheng,

457
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
you said something.

458
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
What are you doing?

459
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
How did you hurt your hand before the game?

460
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,960
The play was bad yesterday.

461
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Brother Cheng's communication was weak.

462
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Brother Cheng's communication was weak.

463
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
The training was bad.

464
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
So he got a call.

465
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Captain,

466
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
the whole world knows that you can't train like this.

467
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
How did God give you up?

468
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
What?

469
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
You're guilty.

470
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Then why did you go?

471
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
You think the training was short.

472
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
You think you can hit him.

473
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Then the problem is back.

474
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Why do you do it every day?

475
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Brother Cheng went to solve Tong Yao's problem.

476
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Solve Tong Yao's problem?

477
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
How to solve it?

478
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Brother Cheng took the relationship with Gong An.

479
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
He found out the bottom of the desert king.

480
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
He found out that this person is in Shenzhen.

481
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
What's the result?

482
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,960
The result is the same as the prediction of the country.

483
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
It's a special thing.

484
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
He didn't commit suicide.

485
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
He's not a student.

486
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Now he's in the police station.

487
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Tong Yao,

488
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
get ready.

489
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
In a few days,

490
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
we're going to the police station

491
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
and face the mask.

492
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
I...

493
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
I've already prepared the apology.

494
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I'm sorry.

495
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Captain.

496
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Did Xiaorui not answer this call?

497
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
You're going to hide forever.

498
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
What the hell are you doing?

499
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Tell us if you're hurt.

500
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
You didn't tell us about Tong Yao's problem.

501
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Are you worried that we won't let you go?

502
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Or are you worried that

503
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
we won't let you take the little coward

504
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
who's hurt by you?

505
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Why didn't you tell us

506
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
in advance and discuss it?

507
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Are you unwilling to tell us

508
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
or you don't believe me at all?

509
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
You don't believe your teammates at all?

510
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Yes.

511
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Tong Yao is your girlfriend.

512
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
But have you ever thought that

513
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
she's not just your girlfriend.

514
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
She's also our teammates.

515
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
She's been wronged outside.

516
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
She's been treated unfairly.

517
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
We won't care.

518
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
We won't let you go?

519
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
That's right.

520
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
We lost a competition today.

521
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
But you know what?

522
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
I didn't lose today

523
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
because of you.

524
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
So I found out

525
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
that Lu Shicheng didn't believe

526
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
your teammates at all

527
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
during this time.

528
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
If you don't believe your teammates,

529
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
I want to say

530
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
that we don't want

531
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
such a teammate like you.

532
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Mo!

533
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Mo!

534
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Hurry up!

535
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
What are you doing?

536
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
What are you doing?

537
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Mo!

538
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
What else can I do?

539
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
I'll go back to my home

540
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
and find my mom.

541
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Don't talk about the plan.

542
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
I'm not talking about the plan.

543
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
You should know

544
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
that I'm about to retire

545
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
because of you.

546
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
I can't win the world championship today.

547
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
My father-in-law

548
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
has no good intentions.

549
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Do you know?

550
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
My parents

551
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
don't agree with me.

552
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
If I can't win the championship today,

553
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I'll go back

554
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
to my home.

555
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
If I go on like this,

556
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
will we be pushed

557
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
like the famous surgery

558
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
in the past?

559
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Are you afraid?

560
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Are you afraid?

561
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Are you not afraid?

562
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Don't go!

563
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Mo!

564
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Mo!

565
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Mo!

566
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Look at what you said.

567
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
It's a plan.

568
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
What's the push-up?

569
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
No one said that.

570
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Brother Cheng's hand

571
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
is just a broken-up

572
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
and not a broken-up.

573
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Why do you think so seriously?

574
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
I'll be next to him

575
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
in today's competition.

576
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
I think he knows it best.

577
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
He'll start

578
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
to change

579
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
after the surgery.

580
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
He said

581
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
you didn't find it, right?

582
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
So,

583
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
relax.

584
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Peace and love.

585
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
The most important thing now

586
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
is to face it together

587
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
and solve the problem.

588
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
How can we face it together?

589
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Is he ready

590
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
to take us together?

591
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Mo,

592
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
you're playing for yourself

593
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
and not for others.

594
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Did you forget

595
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
what you said?

596
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
My dream

597
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
is to win

598
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
every match

599
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
on the battlefield

600
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
with my brothers.

601
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Of course, I think so.

602
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Yes.

603
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm quite angry today.

604
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Brother Cheng

605
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
has already told us

606
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
that he's going to be the main character.

607
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
But in another way,

608
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
he's always doing

609
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
everything for the team,

610
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
right?

611
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
He's always

612
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
under pressure.

613
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
He's used to

614
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
being alone,

615
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
so he thinks

616
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
he has to be open.

617
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
He doesn't believe in us at all.

618
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
The next road

619
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
is the same as the road

620
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
we're going to take together.

621
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Sometimes,

622
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
I'm thinking

623
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
whether

624
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
we've been wrong

625
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
from the beginning.

626
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
You mean the same thing?

627
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
I don't think so.

628
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
It's just that

629
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
he's very good at it.

630
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
He's a good player.

631
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
He's a good player.

632
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
He's a good player.

633
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
He's a good player.

634
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
He's a good player.

635
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
I'm not saying that he's a technical problem.

636
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm saying

637
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
he's a big influence

638
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
on others.

639
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
I've always wanted

640
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
a big news

641
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
in the club.

642
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Now, the news is really not breaking.

643
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
The same thing

644
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
has an influence on us.

645
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
But I think

646
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
he's the one who made the whole team

647
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
and made Chenggeng

648
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
better.

649
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
It's just that

650
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
they may not realize it.

651
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
I'm sorry.

652
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
I'm sorry.

653
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
I'm sorry.

654
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
I'm sorry.

655
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
I'm sorry.

656
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm sorry.

657
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm sorry.

658
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
I'm sorry.

659
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
I'm sorry.

660
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm sorry.

661
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
I'm sorry.

662
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
I'm sorry.

663
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
I'm sorry.

664
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm sorry.

665
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
I'm sorry.

666
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Chenggeng.

667
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Chenggeng.

668
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Chenggeng,

669
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
do you still hurt?

670
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Open the door.

671
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
I'll help you take the medicine.

672
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Chenggeng.

673
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Tong Yao.

674
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
I want to kiss you.

675
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
Okay.

676
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Then when you feel better,

677
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
open the door.

678
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
I'll be here with you.

679
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Let's go.

680
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
Come on.

681
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Get in the car.

682
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Come on.

683
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,800
Hurry up

684
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,200
Because Rock 1 is ruined

685
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
Jing

686
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,960
This is my sister

687
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,880
With I've changed

688
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,520
We do not see you

689
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,960
I don't care

690
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't care

691
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,200
ном�� shaky maybe because you put up with it

692
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,640
people easily join forces

693
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,360
and more easily

694
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,440
all lost

695
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,960
percent

696
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,280
then I can also

697
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
and then the whole option

698
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
while we have the way

699
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,520
to play

700
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,520
fighting

701
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,200
You're so stupid.

702
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,280
What if we're in trouble?

703
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,960
What if you're in trouble?

704
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,240
You'll be scolded every day.

705
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,200
Then,

706
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,600
I'm scolded every day.

707
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,280
But I'm used to it.

708
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,200
Because you're right.

709
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,320
Whether it's food or

710
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,520
a fight,

711
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,440
the truth is that

712
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,640
you're right.

713
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
So,

714
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,840
I'm used to it.

715
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,720
I'm used to listening to you.

716
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,960
I'm used to relying on you.

717
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,880
I think you can't do anything.

718
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,120
You've always been the leader of ZGDX.

719
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,480
You've always been the world's top three.

720
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,160
You're very strong.

721
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,200
It seems that everything can be solved by itself.

722
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,120
But

723
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,320
I still have to listen to you.

724
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,560
Although you're the leader,

725
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,920
you don't have to protect your mother or Xiao Ji.

726
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,800
You have to protect everyone.

727
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,000
You're human.

728
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,640
You're not a god.

729
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,120
You can't bear it.

730
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,320
Or you can't solve it.

731
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,000
You said that

732
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,560
you're not the perfect man

733
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,600
in my heart.

734
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,040
Actually, I'm not.

735
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Although

736
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,840
I've seen you wear a t-shirt

737
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,640
and don't have a beard.

738
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,640
But

739
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,160
you can't replace it in my heart.

740
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,480
There's one more thing.

741
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,040
I didn't tell you.

742
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,200
It's

743
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,880
you openly love this thing.

744
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,440
From a girlfriend's point of view,

745
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,600
I'm really touched.

746
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,400
Because you don't care about the world's eyes.

747
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,000
It means you care about me.

748
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
You love me.

749
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,160
I'm really happy.

750
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,320
Do you know that?

751
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,280
I'm really grateful to you.

752
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,680
You helped me find that girl

753
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,480
and found out everything.

754
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,520
The club said

755
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,120
that Xiaorui told me

756
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,880
that it's okay.

757
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,080
You have to be a judge.

758
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,480
I've been scolded

759
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,920
and prepared to apologize.

760
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,120
Because there are always so many people who tell me

761
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,680
that you're a public figure.

762
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,560
When you enjoy the glory of the light,

763
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,720
you have to learn to bear the dark side behind the light.

764
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,560
No matter how much you suffer,

765
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,600
no matter how much you're responsible.

766
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,200
But you

767
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,400
gave me a different answer.

768
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
Tell me.

769
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,240
Don't be so upset with yourself.

770
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,000
Because you're here.

771
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,320
Because you're here.

772
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yunshan.

773
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,440
Do you know that?

774
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
I feel sad.

775
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,440
I feel sad.

776
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,280
Because of you,

777
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,880
I've always been

778
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,680
situations where you're upset.

779
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,600
For what we're going through,

780
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm良 to you.

781
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,920
The manager, the mother.

782
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
But I still believe.

783
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I still believe we can win the championship, you know?

784
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
I don't care about the pressure given by the company.

785
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
I don't care about how others say me.

786
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Do you know what I care about?

787
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
I care about you the most.

788
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
I care about you the most.

789
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
I don't want to lose you all.

790
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Do you understand?

791
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
I care about you the most.

792
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Lu Si Cheng.

793
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
If you don't make it up,

794
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
I will be very guilty.

795
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
I will be very guilty.

796
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,920
If the cat leaves because of this disappointment,

797
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
I will feel that it's all my fault.

798
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,920
I am very bad at mental control.

799
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
It's easy to break my heart.

800
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,920
If the team really does something wrong because of this,

801
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
I...

802
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Will you tell me?

803
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
I will.

804
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
I might be wrong.

805
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
I am very bad at mental control.

806
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
And I really want to have a new life.

807
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Maybe I will be with you for the rest of my life.

808
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I can't imagine your expression.

809
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
I used to think

810
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
I can handle everything.

811
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
I don't care about anyone's eyes.

812
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
I am wrong.

813
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
I am wrong.

814
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
I thought I can handle everything.

815
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
I am wrong.

816
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
I don't care about anything.

817
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
I will be afraid.

818
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
I will be helpless.

819
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,920
I will have this day.

820
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,920
I need you.

821
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
I need you.

822
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
I need you.

823
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
I need you.

824
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
I need you.

825
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
I need you.

826
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
I need you.

827
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
I need you.

828
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
I need you.

829
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
I need you.

830
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
I need you.

831
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
I need you.

832
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
I need you.

833
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
I need you.

834
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
I need you.

835
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
I need you.

836
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
I need you.

837
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
I need you.

838
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
I need you.

839
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Today is Monday.

840
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
I Root down.

841
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,920
I'm going to make a little bit of a cake.

842
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

843
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

844
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

845
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

846
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

847
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

848
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

849
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

850
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

851
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

852
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

853
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

854
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

855
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

856
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

857
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

858
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

859
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

860
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

861
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,920
I'm going to make a cake with a little bit of cream.

862
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,920
The main draw was

863
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,920
I got my thoughts so Deep.

864
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Ski好.

865
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Ski好.

866
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Took a long time.

867
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,920
jerky.

868
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,920
At school you have one birthday birthday party in college?

869
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,920
I changed the strategy of the God of the Gods.

870
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
It's my fault.

871
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
I'm sorry, everyone.

872
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
In the future,

873
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,920
you don't have to be so generous to me.

874
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
If I do something wrong,

875
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
just tell me.

876
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
I will change.

877
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
As the captain,

878
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm really wrong about Shan Zili.

879
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,920
I just hope that everyone can give me some time

880
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,920
to learn and change the strategy.

881
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Right?

882
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
I'm self-sufficient.

883
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,920
I'm not a bad person.

884
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
I can't be alone

885
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
in the whole battle.

886
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
I can't even rely on myself

887
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
to do everything.

888
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,920
I admit that I need you.

889
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
I hope that you can accept my apology.

890
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,920
From now on,

891
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
I hope that we can face everything

892
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
that we've encountered together.

893
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920
I will play well in the next game.

894
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,920
I will train hard.

895
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,920
ZJDX is not my only team.

896
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,920
It's our team.

897
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,920
I hope that we can fight till the end.

898
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
There's no regret.

899
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
There's no resentment.

900
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm sorry.

901
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,920
I apologize again for my self-sufficiency

902
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
and my stubbornness.

903
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:51,220
Your

904
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
postponed

905
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
for nine days,

906
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Heilong's

907
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,920
girl

908
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,080
I'm sorry.

909
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,680
Brother Cheng,

910
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,280
do you want to apologize to me

911
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,680
for not giving you the ability to save money?

912
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,280
Fatty, don't be so angry.

913
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,120
Let go of me.

914
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,880
You're a little tired.

915
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,720
I should apologize.

916
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,480
Fatty, what are you pretending to be?

917
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,880
Who woke up in the morning

918
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,680
and called to say that Brother Cheng didn't want to see you?

919
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,680
Brother Cheng, you scared me.

920
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
I'm sorry. I'm not good.

921
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,480
I'm not good either.

922
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Don't cry.

923
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
I didn't cry.

924
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,680
I'm not good at crying.

925
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
How can my brother cry?

926
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Really.

927
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
Really.

928
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Good.

929
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,400
That's right.

930
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,080
A family needs to be full of energy.

931
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
No one can be less.

932
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Hello.

933
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Hello.

934
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
We're here. Let's go in.

935
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
Let's go.

936
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
Are you nervous?

937
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Don't worry. I'm here.

938
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Let's go.

939
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
You know the details of the situation.

940
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Today, we arranged you to meet up

941
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
to solve the problem.

942
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Lin Mo,

943
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Weibo ID

944
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
Mo Mo is the owner of the Demon King.

945
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
This is his parents.

946
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
According to our investigation,

947
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,280
the copy of that knife

948
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
is indeed what Lin Mo sent.

949
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
The young people now

950
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
have to be a little bit more careful.

951
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,280
It's like a kind of evil to make a copy.

952
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
We deal with it every month

953
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,280
for about a month or two.

954
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,280
Have you been examined?

955
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,280
Yes.

956
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Please take a look.

957
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
Usually,

958
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
it's a good thing that we're here.

959
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
But the child is still a child.

960
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
She doesn't know anything.

961
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
She scolded me.

962
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,280
I think

963
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,280
the child was scared by the evil.

964
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,280
She's been teaching.

965
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,280
I guess she won't dare to do it again.

966
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Yes.

967
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
The child is still a child.

968
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,280
My daughter is only 18 years old.

969
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
She's not in the year of the child's death.

970
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
She's going to college.

971
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
Yes.

972
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
We'll go back.

973
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,280
We'll teach her well.

974
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,280
We'll take care of the medical expenses.

975
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
The online thing

976
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
is quite bad to get the reality.

977
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Right?

978
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
And our child

979
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
has been crying all the way here.

980
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
You said

981
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
she'd teach him from school.

982
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,280
When he goes back,

983
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,280
the classmate doesn't know

984
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
how to talk to him.

985
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
And my dad and I

986
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
have to work.

987
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
No, sister He.

988
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
Your child is 18 years old.

989
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
My child is also 20 years old.

990
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
If you don't know

991
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,280
your child's little things,

992
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,280
then forget it.

993
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
What about the harm and harm

994
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
that our child has?

995
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,280
Not only did she

996
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,280
make a mess online,

997
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,280
but also make a scam.

998
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,280
She also sold her child online.

999
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
She said she was willing to commit suicide.

1000
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,280
Because this is

1001
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
causing more insult and trouble

1002
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,280
to our child.

1003
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
What should we do about this?

1004
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,280
So we can't see each other.

1005
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Apologize to her.

1006
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I... I didn't mean it.

1007
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,280
I'm sorry.

1008
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,280
I won't do it again.

1009
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
Please forgive me.

1010
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,280
Don't be nervous.

1011
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Remember not to make a scam.

1012
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,280
And you can't close the scam

1013
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
online for a few days.

1014
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,280
Just keep a black dot

1015
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,280
on your back.

1016
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,280
Just keep it for a while

1017
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,280
and keep some money.

1018
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
Playing a game online?

1019
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Is it that serious?

1020
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
No, it's not.

1021
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
How about this?

1022
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,280
I'll break her hand

1023
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
before you get back to your school.

1024
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,280
It's not serious either.

1025
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
We can come again tomorrow.

1026
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,280
What are you talking about?

1027
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,280
We didn't do it on purpose.

1028
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,280
Be careful.

1029
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
This is the public security bureau.

1030
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,280
What's wrong with the public security bureau?

1031
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,280
Exactly.

1032
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
What's wrong with the public security bureau?

1033
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
What about you?

1034
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Our problem is that

1035
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
we don't want to solve it.

1036
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Let's go.

1037
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,280
Why don't you talk about the reason?

1038
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,280
How did they leave?

1039
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
How did they leave?

1040
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,280
Comrade police,

1041
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,280
if we don't want to solve it,

1042
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,280
we should leave the case.

1043
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
Yes.

1044
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,280
If we leave this case,

1045
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,280
will it affect our college?

1046
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
What do you mean?

1047
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,280
If we leave this case,

1048
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,280
we'll lose the girl.

1049
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
You're a new girl.

1050
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
I'm a new girl, too.

1051
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,280
We're asking for you,

1052
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
a new girl.

1053
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,280
Leave?

1054
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
How can we leave this case?

1055
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Don't say it's been five days.

1056
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,280
It's not even a day.

1057
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
My child has to go to school.

1058
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
She was fine last time.

1059
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,280
Why did she leave this time?

1060
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,280
It's all the same.

1061
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Comrade police,

1062
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
how can you talk like that?

1063
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
As parents,

1064
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,280
you can't teach your child well.

1065
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,280
There's a problem.

1066
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
You should think about how to avoid punishment first.

1067
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
It's irresponsible.

1068
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,280
She's done this twice.

1069
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,280
Three months ago,

1070
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
she wrote a letter to someone.

1071
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,280
She was the one who stole her idol.

1072
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
Is this a flower?

1073
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
No.

1074
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,280
What can a letter be?

1075
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,280
What can it be?

1076
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,280
There's no law at all.

1077
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,280
Are you afraid of the child?

1078
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Don't you have parents?

1079
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
Last time,

1080
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,280
she didn't follow your responsibility.

1081
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
But she didn't mean she was wrong.

1082
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,280
You're too much.

1083
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,280
I can't adjust it.

1084
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,280
Next,

1085
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
let's leave the case.

1086
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
You've worked hard.

1087
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
We'll contact later.

1088
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,280
How can this be?

1089
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
This...

1090
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,280
This can't be.

1091
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,280
I don't believe it.

1092
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
This...

1093
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
It's a slip.

1094
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,280
How is it?

1095
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,280
I didn't expect this.

1096
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,280
This little girl

1097
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
was scolded

1098
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,280
because she was forbidden to drink.

1099
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
This time,

1100
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,280
she's afraid of being kept.

1101
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,280
According to the 20th law of the Police Department,

1102
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
the one who violated the law of the Police Department

1103
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
was punished severely.

1104
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,280
The one who received the punishment

1105
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,280
of the Police Department in six months

1106
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,280
is the one who was under the law of the Police Department.

1107
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,280
The one who was under the law of the Police Department

1108
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,280
was punished under the law of the Police Department.

1109
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,280
The one who was under the law of the Police Department

1110
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,280
was sentenced to more than five days

1111
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,280
or more than 10 days

1112
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
of sentence.

1113
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
She was punished under the law of the Police Department

1114
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,280
for the punishment of the Police Department.

1115
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,280
Number one,

1116
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
how to put a record on the case,

1117
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
or other methods

1118
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,280
to threaten other people's safety.

1119
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,280
She's been under the law for 18 years now.

1120
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,280
She's been under the law for 6 months now.

1121
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,280
How can we deal with it?

1122
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,280
You were prepared

1123
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,280
to get the punishment.

1124
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,280
How did you know she was under the law?

1125
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,280
How did I know?

1126
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,280
Why did you say that?

1127
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,280
I graduated from the Law School.

1128
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,280
I heard Lu Yue said before that I'm not a heart.

1129
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,280
Isn't that great?

1130
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,280
Our kid is still young. What should we do?

1131
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,280
Enough, enough. Stop it.

1132
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,280
It's not your fault.

1133
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,280
You're always so innocent.

1134
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,280
What's the point of being nice to me?

1135
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,280
Hurry up and think of a way to do it.

1136
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,280
I'm just letting you spoil it.

1137
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,280
Let's go. I'm done watching.

1138
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,280
What should we do?

1139
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,280
What should we do?

1140
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
Why is this kid so angry?

1141
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,280
ZGTX's electronic entertainment department is seriously famous.

1142
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,280
Yuan Weibo ID is the user of the Mokpo King.

1143
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,280
It was published in the forum before.

1144
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,280
How did it happen?

1145
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,280
It was sent to the same woman to send malicious packages.

1146
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,280
This is why the same woman was hurt by the finger.

1147
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,280
ZGTX's electronic entertainment department has been actively cooperating with the police to investigate the evidence.

1148
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,280
The police have now submitted the investigation results of the case.

1149
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,280
Mokpo King is already a teenager.

1150
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,280
He has no medical evidence.

1151
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,280
He committed suicide and is in the hospital.

1152
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,280
He is also a legal rights activist.

1153
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,280
The entertainment department is seriously famous.

1154
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,280
First, please contact the Mokpo King and send him the information.

1155
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,280
And then apologize to the same woman.

1156
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,280
Second, please contact the internet users and platform to stop the broadcast.

1157
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,280
And then comment on the information.

1158
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,280
What are you looking at?

1159
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
Look.

1160
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
What's this?

1161
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,280
Do you know?

1162
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,280
This is the most useful.

1163
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,280
No one can be in the forum.

1164
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,280
No one will be in the trouble.

1165
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,280
I'm afraid that you will fall in love with him.

1166
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,280
What's wrong?

1167
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,280
I'm sorry.

1168
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,280
