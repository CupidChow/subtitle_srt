00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,040
the meaning of T-Ball.

The promotion

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,260
I forgot the target

100
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,920
This is intense

101
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,500

We truly have the pride to compete with you

108
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,440
I don't think that's even possible

109
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,080
It took me 50 years to make this song

110
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,760
So this song

111
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,960

She is also a sister.

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,360
Xiaoshin.

116
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,360
Girl.

117
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,080
You are pretentious.

118
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Chen Jingyang.

119
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Wait a minute.

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
Chen Jingyang.

121
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
You can't get up?

122
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Didn't you say you have a little time left?

123
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Someone asked me to play the game online.

124
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm not good at this.

125
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm so lucky.

126
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
I know how to play games all day.

127
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
It's a private life.

128
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Look at the girl in the club.

129
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,280
What's wrong with you?

130
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
You're so fierce.

131
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
I broke up with Ai Jia.

132
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Didn't you say you wanted to talk about the future?

133
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Why did you break up?

134
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
I can't make a decision.

135
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Cut the crap.

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm going shopping.

137
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I'm going. Let's go.

138
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm so lucky.

139
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
I know how to play games all day.

140
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Playing games is more important than your girlfriend.

141
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
I've been back for months.

142
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
I finally got her to play without training.

143
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
I'm in a bad mood with her.

144
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Guess what?

145
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm in a bad mood too.

146
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Yingying.

147
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
I want to see her.

148
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
She said she's a good wife.

149
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I'll open the camera tonight.

150
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Come and see me.

151
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Give me some gifts.

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm so tired.

153
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
I'm so tired last class.

154
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
I'm tired of playing games.

155
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Kong Ying.

156
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
What?

157
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
You asked me to guess?

158
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I really admire you guys.

159
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
You're playing games in a date.

160
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Even if you're playing games,

161
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
you want me to guess?

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Please.

163
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Women are good at playing games.

164
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
If there's a game in this world

165
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
and a life of a man,

166
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
what's the matter with you guys?

167
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,280
I told you not to agree to that professional young man.

168
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
As the saying goes,

169
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
love is the best.

170
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
There's no love.

171
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
He He.

172
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Love is the best.

173
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
You have Jian Yang in front of you.

174
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
You're not a professional player?

175
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
That's my young and immature.

176
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
It's all over.

177
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Don't mention it again.

178
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Anyway,

179
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm serious this time.

180
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I've been studying three years of my life abroad.

181
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
I'm still a young man.

182
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
I should have stayed abroad

183
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
if I knew that.

184
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Tong Yao.

185
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
I'm talking to you.

186
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
You know how to play games.

187
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
What's wrong?

188
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
I'm a bitch.

189
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Someone asked me to work.

190
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
I'm a bitch.

191
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Are you a liar?

192
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,280
But he lied to me about my career.

193
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Who knows?

194
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
The liar is so stubborn.

195
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
He's a professional girl

196
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
who's been developing the electronic industry.

197
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Another message.

198
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
I forgot to introduce myself.

199
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,280
We're a professional team.

200
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Congratulations.

201
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,280
You just passed

202
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
our test match.

203
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
You played well.

204
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Do you want to join me?

205
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
You're a newbie.

206
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
You can win the game.

207
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
If you're not satisfied,

208
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
you can play again.

209
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
Ask him

210
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
which team he's from.

211
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Okay.

212
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,280
We're ZGDX.

213
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
ZGDX.

214
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
It's ZGDX.

215
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Who's ZGDX?

216
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,280
It's Lu Si Cheng's ZGDX.

217
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Lu Si Cheng

218
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
who's the one who

219
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,280
loves to stand next to him.

220
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
The one who's a fan of him.

221
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
The one who's a fan of him.

222
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
You even watched Lu Si Cheng

223
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
wear a pajamas.

224
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I've never watched Lu Si Cheng

225
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
wear pajamas.

226
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
It's not the point.

227
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
The point is,

228
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
why didn't he answer Chinese?

229
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Maybe it's his phone.

230
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
He can't answer Chinese.

231
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
ZGDX.

232
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
ZGDX.

233
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
ZGDX.

234
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
You used to have it.

235
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Lu.

236
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Dad, mom.

237
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm back.

238
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Lu.

239
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Lu.

240
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
You're back.

241
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
What's wrong?

242
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Everyone's listening to you.

243
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Mom.

244
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I'm back.

245
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Wash your hands and get ready to eat.

246
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
When I was playing games,

247
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
someone sent me a message

248
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
saying that

249
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
it's for me to work.

250
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Or a very famous team.

251
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,280
I got a call today.

252
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
It was when I was in the supermarket.

253
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I got a call.

254
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
I was busy.

255
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Today,

256
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
the OPL Spring Festival will open in Shanghai.

257
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
The two teams that will be participating in the competition

258
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
are ZGDX and CK.

259
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
The competition of the YGC Grand Finals

260
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
will be held by thousands of people.

261
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Actually, the most professional player

262
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
is the champion on the stage.

263
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
It seems to be a cool thing.

264
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
It's a choice.

265
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
I don't think

266
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
we should consider

267
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
the competition of the YGC Grand Finals.

268
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
It's late.

269
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
We're going to work in the company.

270
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
We know how to play games.

271
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Mom.

272
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
You're so good at lying.

273
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Someone told me to ask you to work.

274
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
You're a kid.

275
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
You can't eat without washing your hands.

276
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Give it to me.

277
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Look at you now.

278
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
You're a girl.

279
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
You'll be eaten by the keyboard

280
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
by the late night.

281
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
If you don't get dirty, I'll get dirty.

282
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Come here and wash your hands.

283
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Eat, old man.

284
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Coming.

285
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
The food is good today.

286
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Mom.

287
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
If someone really wants to

288
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
work for me,

289
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
I'll do it.

290
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
No, I won't eat.

291
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Dad.

292
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
No.

293
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
You're holding it elsewhere.

294
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
No.

295
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Don't you know

296
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
why I have great clothes?

297
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Because I can't see in it.

298
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Even before you remember it,

299
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
the old lady is still not laughing.

300
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,000
I've got to see my brother.

301
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,040
What do you think of me?

302
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,680
I'm a little shy to say this,

303
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,640
but I'm actually always shy to say this.

304
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
Sooner or later,

305
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,760
I'm going to marry you next year.

306
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
You are a doll,

307
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
Tell me, have I said everything?

308
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Is mum your brain going to doomed?

309
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,360
Immvalue without profit.

310
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,760
Oh, uncеЎ

311
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,520
Being able to survive this project, I already figured of it out.

312
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,240
But, you also have yet to consider everything.

313
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,240
To go to Shanghai to play one course for good.

314
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,000
But you want to know about the career strategic in Shanghai, right?

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,900
You already like for a comfortable life.

316
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,980
Good day.

317
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,360
The most important thing is the professional lens that young people are interested in.

318
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,360
In the future, it is also possible to become a physical lens project on the global stage.

319
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,360
The most important thing is the professional lens that young people are interested in.

320
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Let's go.

321
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
The most important thing is the professional lens that young people are interested in.

322
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Hello, you are Tong Yao, right?

323
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Xiaorui.

324
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Yes, I am the person who contacted you.

325
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I am the manager of ZGDX.

326
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Hello, Mr. Rui.

327
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Don't be so formal.

328
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
We are not in this style.

329
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Just call me Xiaorui.

330
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Here, I will give you a discount.

331
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Thank you.

332
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,360
By the way, that little brother.

333
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Is Brother Cheng also living here?

334
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Yes.

335
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
But they are not here now.

336
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
They are going to the training camp.

337
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Do you miss them?

338
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
No, I don't.

339
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
I don't miss them at all.

340
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Why?

341
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Those trainees who came to our base

342
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
didn't want to see Brother Cheng immediately.

343
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
I also miss them.

344
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,360
But I don't have a system today.

345
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Xiaorui.

346
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
What a group.

347
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
These media

348
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
don't know where they got the news that Mingsheng is going to retire.

349
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
They want to make a big news

350
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
because of two crazy things these days.

351
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Mingsheng is going to retire?

352
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Because of hand injury?

353
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Oh my god, that's Mingsheng.

354
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
That's why we need you, sister Xiao.

355
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
How about it?

356
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Have you thought it over?

357
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Do you want to join ZGDX?

358
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,320
It's okay.

359
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Take your time and think it over.

360
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
I will eat it when I am older.

361
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
But if you want to join us,

362
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
this year's news is the best for you all.

363
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
No.

364
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
The news is the best to me.

365
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
We have to be Rahligutus.

366
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
don't.

367
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Don't.

368
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Don't.

369
00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Don't.

370
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
So cute.

371
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
What's going on?

372
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,720
I heard you got injured.

373
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Can you still keep up with the game?

374
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,920
I heard that after this game,

375
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,680
you will announce the retirement.

376
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Is that true?

377
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Don't touch her.

378
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,000
Yiwen's smile.

379
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm still

380
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,840
Finally she's all ex activ

381
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,240

382
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,080
Brother Cheng, what Всем achieved today? Does pick a champion has to drink?

383
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,520
Did Tongs say anything?

384
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,100
Maybe 다 avoir distinguishedili qu yas confidence, what about what?

385
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,220
I don't want to report. Go.

386
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,640
Brother Cheng, sister Cheng!

387
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,120
Brother Cheng...

388
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,720
Come on!

389
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,400
Come on!

390
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,960
Come on!

391
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,480
Come on!

392
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,920
Come on!

393
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,520
Come on!

394
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,120
Come on!

395
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,760
Come on!

396
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,440
Come on!

397
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,000
Come on!

398
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,520
Come on!

399
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,080
Come on!

400
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,600
Come on!

401
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,360
Come on!

402
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,080
Come on!

403
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,760
They are all smiling.

404
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,680
I guess they lost again today.

405
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,560
Is it my fault?

406
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,680
Cheng seems to be a bit fierce.

407
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,840
Just a little.

408
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
He doesn't look fierce.

409
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,360
It's okay.

410
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,200
If you come to our team,

411
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,360
you are our only few.

412
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,280
He won't be fierce.

413
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,920
Let's go.

414
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,560
Okay.

415
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
You can go buy something first.

416
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,360
I'll buy you a bag of steamed buns.

417
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,680
I'll buy you a bag of steamed buns.

418
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,560
I'll buy you a bag of steamed buns.

419
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll buy you a bag of steamed buns.

420
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,640
I'll buy you a bag of steamed buns.

421
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,400
I'll buy you a bag of steamed buns.

422
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm so tired.

423
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
I'm so tired.

424
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,760
I'm so tired.

425
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm so tired.

426
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm so tired.

427
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm so tired.

428
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,800
I'm so tired.

429
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,600
I'm so tired.

430
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,240
I'm so tired.

431
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm so tired.

432
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm so tired.

433
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm so tired.

434
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm so tired.

435
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm so tired.

436
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm so tired.

437
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,320
I'm so tired.

438
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm so tired.

439
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,560
I'm so tired.

440
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,120
I'm so tired.

441
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,720
I'm so tired.

442
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm so tired.

443
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm so tired.

444
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm so tired.

445
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm so tired.

446
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,240
I'm so tired.

447
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm so tired.

448
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm so tired.

449
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm so tired.

450
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,760
I'm so tired.

451
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm so tired.

452
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm so tired.

453
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Be okay.

454
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,920
Ohh!

455
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,520
Know how to use it?

456
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,400
Got it, done.

457
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,760
Thank you, Captain.

458
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,440
Chen I am bad.

459
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,120
Can it be?

460
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
my brother

461
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
I was a little nervous.

462
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,880
I just bought this bucket of water.

463
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,400
How about I buy another bucket later?

464
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,280
There's only a bucket of water left in the supermarket.

465
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,840
I saw a kid

466
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,440
hiding it in the most expensive place.

467
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,040
I thought the kid was safe

468
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,600
when I was in the world.

469
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
I saw it with my eyes.

470
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,320
I was embarrassed.

471
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,440
Where did the thief come from?

472
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,320
I hid it in the back of the warehouse.

473
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,960
But I still found it.

474
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,400
It's so annoying.

475
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay, okay.

476
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
You've been bullied for 800 times.

477
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,080
Let me ask you.

478
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,640
Are you living in the same hotel with Lu Si Cheng?

479
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,640
Yes.

480
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,800
That's good.

481
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,440
What?

482
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,440
You want to see Lu Si Cheng?

483
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,800
It's not good.

484
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,920
At least consider the feelings of the family.

485
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,560
I'm not happy with that.

486
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,280
I just want to think about the feelings of my ex-boyfriend.

487
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,880
The most toxic and negative.

488
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,560
How about you sign the contract?

489
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
You're also a good middle-aged man.

490
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,840
I thought when you play the game,

491
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,720
you put the love home on the floor and rub it.

492
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,520
I'll be a pretty little cat.

493
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
You said that the store was not only for your boyfriend,

494
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,800
but also for your ex-boyfriend.

495
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,960
Yes.

496
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,800
I must have a grudge with the store in my life.

497
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,640
I'll rob my boyfriend's home.

498
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,600
Okay, okay.

499
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,760
I've said it many times.

500
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,840
Anyway, when you bully my ex-boyfriend,

501
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,880
you two will go to the dark together.

502
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,600
No way.

503
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,480
Don't be angry.

504
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,880
Look,

505
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,520
I'll drink my fake perfume first.

506
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,080
That's good.

507
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,600
Is this hair buyer's room for murder?

508
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,320
Of course.

509
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,240
I didn't disappoint you.

510
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,960
Why are you gathering so many quereraires?

511
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,480
It's just the matter that happened last year.

512
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,600
So what?

513
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,240
It's that Lu Si Cheng.

514
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,000
He's alive?

515
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,920
I'm dreaming.

516
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,000
Lu Si Cheng is in the same elevator

517
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,840
with me.

518
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,520
Let's go, let's go.

519
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,480
Calm down.

520
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,040
How much trees?

521
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,240
46.

522
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,700
House Aha

523
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,120
Thank you

524
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,920
So embarrassing

525
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,200
He must think I'm especially

526
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,540
It's like period bérat

527
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,300
No, explain

528
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,900
Explain

529
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm good enough

530
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,340
What?

531
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,840
Hey,

532
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,380
why are we going so far?

533
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:43,960
Alright.

534
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm not here at home.

535
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,120
Go outside and just try to escape.

536
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,880
What?

537
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,060
Let me pass my answer.

538
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,000
Sorry,

539
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,720
お願いします.

540
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Sorry!

541
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,180
Let's go outside to look around.

542
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,720
Ma'am!

543
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Why are you here?

544
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,340
Don't you know

545
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,300
I'm going to the gym.

546
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,780
I'm tired of these women.

547
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,860
I can't see them.

548
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,940
I have to come here to enjoy the heat.

549
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,900
Interesting.

550
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Look at those guys.

551
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,700
I guess no one can recognize them.

552
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,100
What are you talking about?

553
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,420
You can't play games, can you?

554
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,580
You mean

555
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,300
you can't play games

556
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,300
and don't deserve to watch the game?

557
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:21,940
Yes.

558
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,460
Everyone is here to watch the game.

559
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,580
What's wrong with her?

560
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,580
You want to say that to her?

561
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,180
How do you know

562
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,300
no one can recognize her?

563
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,660
Maybe you can ask her

564
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,660
to play the game on the ground.

565
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,340
Yes.

566
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,900
Maybe you can't beat me.

567
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,540
We didn't mean that.

568
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,180
There are too few girls

569
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,380
who can play well.

570
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,300
Yes.

571
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,300
We didn't mean that.

572
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,100
Miss,

573
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,060
what's your rank?

574
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,220
The leader of the capital.

575
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,780
That's awesome.

576
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,060
The leader of the capital.

577
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,220
Let's count.

578
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,580
Two.

579
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,860
One, two, three.

580
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,460
Excuse me.

581
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,060
Thank you.

582
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,700
You're so good.

583
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,740
You're so good.

584
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,940
You're the best.

585
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,980
It's you.

586
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,700
Thank you for talking to us.

587
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,380
It's okay.

588
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,940
I really can't get used to those kids.

589
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,500
I don't know where they come from.

590
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,860
You prepared so many things.

591
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,220
Why are you so concerned about them?

592
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
You're sitting in this area

593
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,540
and you're also a fan of ZJDX, right?

594
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,900
Here, I give it to you.

595
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,060
Thank you.

596
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,060
How much?

597
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,540
It's free to send to fans.

598
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,220
Don't get any money.

599
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,100
You'll be fine when you get a promotion.

600
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,900
Well,

601
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,540
I didn't realize

602
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,140
these girls were so cute.

603
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,020
If they like me,

604
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,220
I'm so happy.

605
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,140
You forgot that

606
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,300
when these girls

607
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,060
gave you a bag of cigarettes,

608
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,380
you wrote a lottery.

609
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,620
You've been so polite lately.

610
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,460
I broke up with my family.

611
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,620
I think you can last for a few days.

612
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,300
It's your turn.

613
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,900
All the ladies

614
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,780

the finals today.

619
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,620

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,240
Let's welcome

The king of CK

637
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,800
Yang Shuo

638
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,600
Keep quiet

639
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
The number of people who have been selected by ZK

640
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
is very high.

641
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
It's indeed the boy who is the new girl in Wanqian.

642
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
I just noticed that your emotions have been fluctuated.

643
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
It's only once.

644
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
How much do you want, sister?

645
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Next, let's welcome ZJTX.

646
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,760
How much are you going to deserve?

647
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
So many.

648
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Students, you are the best!

649
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Everyone, come up here with an example!

650
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Hold on!

651
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,040
The fans are very excited to see us in the venue.

652
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,720
Let's have a look at the next interview.

653
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,440
Before the match,

654
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,520
what do you want to say to the audience?

655
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,120
The fans of CK Team,

656
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,440
you should cheer for us.

657
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,840
We won't disappoint you.

658
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,000
Thank you.

659
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,160
Let's have a look at the captain, Chen Ge.

660
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,560
As the captain of ZGTX,

661
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,360
what do you want to say to the opponent?

662
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,480
Okay.

663
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,360
Our Chen Ge is really a great player.

664
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,320
The match is about to begin.

665
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,800
Let's look forward to their wonderful performance.

666
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,680
Okay, audience of the venue,

667
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,880
hello, everyone.

668
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,880
This is the final match of the 2020 ZGTX.

669
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,720
I have said that

670
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,320
the venue hasn't been fully booked yet.

671
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,240
I am today's commentator, Xiao Fan.

672
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,640
Come on, let's have a look.

673
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Our players have entered the game area.

674
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,560
Yes.

675
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,360
Teacher Xiao Fan, guess who will win

676
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,360
today's ZGTX against CK Team.

677
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,680
In fact,

678
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,360
the two teams' play style is different.

679
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,680
Although they are old-fashioned teams,

680
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,120
their style is different.

681
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,720
I guess it's CK.

682
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,640
Okay, CK.

683
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,360
But I don't think they will win.

684
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,280
Because the first place in the ZGTX is

685
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,360
the venue they won.

686
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,680
Let's have a look.

687
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,280
Let's have a look.

688
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,680
Okay.

689
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,160
Let's give the time to the audience

690
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,000
to see who will win today's ZGTX.

691
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,800
Xiao Fan.

692
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,760
The one who passed the game is the one who lost.

693
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,480
Too much.

694
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Come on, ZGTX.

695
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,840
Let's continue.

696
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,080
Continue.

697
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,120
This little sister.

698
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,160
She is so good at it.

699
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,240
Is there a private heart in ZGTX?

700
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,920
The girls in the venue are all beautiful.

701
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,720
ZGTX is so shameless.

702
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
The girls are so shameless.

703
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,400
Sorry.

704
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,080
The water is on the keyboard.

705
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,160
Why is she in Shanghai?

706
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,520
Who is she?

707
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,440
My ancestor.

708
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,920
An ancestor?

709
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,840
An ancestor is good.

710
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
An ancestor will protect you from the game.

711
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
It's a game of playing.

712
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,640
It's a game of being broken by others.

713
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,960
So awesome.

714
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
You have money?

715
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,840
Okay.

716
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,560
The game officially begins.

717
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,520
The first one is the BP section.

718
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,440
In order to take care of many new players,

719
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,520
we need to introduce

720
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,560
the team that will be the champion and the champion.

721
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,400
Coach, the mountain wind is strong.

722
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,080
Let's move it.

723
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,960
Try the mountain wind.

724
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,800
ZGTX team first chose

725
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,480
to move the mountain wind.

726
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,920
Okay, I will move it.

727
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,280
It's too stable in front.

728
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,920
Okay.

729
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,600
Move the jade scroll.

730
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,440
See you.

731
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,960
Move the salt.

732
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,560
The two teams are moving the jade scroll

733
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,080
separately.

734
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,880
The jade scroll and the salt.

735
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,880
CQ will move the green yellow tree.

736
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,840
Let's move it.

737
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,400
Go.

738
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,920
Perfect.

739
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,440
Okay.

740
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,120
The last one is for the green mango.

741
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,760
Okay.

742
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Okay, now both teams

743
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,120
are in the peak section.

744
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,720
Fang Fang, give the god a mask.

745
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,560
Okay.

746
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,800
The first one is

747
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,680
the mask.

748
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,400
At this time, CQ,

749
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,600
I think we should choose

750
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,640
a god who can fight against the mask.

751
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
To face the mask,

752
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,080
the front line is weak.

753
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,760
I will choose the jade scroll.

754
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,560
God Yang, which jade scroll do you choose?

755
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,840
I saw his game.

756
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,160
He has passed his level.

757
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,680
He has passed his level.

758
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,120
And he has a good game.

759
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,800
If the front line

760
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,920
is not good enough for him,

761
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,480
God Yang.

762
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
He is the most powerful god in the world.

763
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,880
God Yang.

764
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,680
What are you thinking?

765
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,280
The lock is...

766
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,000
The lock is...

767
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,440
What is God Yang hesitating about?

768
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,520
He hasn't locked it yet.

769
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Choose the jade scroll.

770
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,000
My god.

771
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,840
What happened?

772
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,120
God Yang actually chose a big dog.

773
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,360
What is this?

774
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,480
Yu, what did you get me?

775
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,280
What are you thinking about?

776
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,480
Oh, no.

777
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,560
Xu Le Yuan really came.

778
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,320
Okay.

779
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,080
Calm down.

780
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,160
Fight well.

781
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,480
Choose a big dog.

782
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,800
What kind of famous god is the opposite?

783
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,600
I don't understand.

784
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,000
Maybe it's the other one.

785
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,160
It's hard to increase the game.

786
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,240
Maybe the opposite

787
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,480
is the one who has the most points.

788
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,360
Shut up.

789
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's start.

790
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,640
Go, go, go.

791
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,360
Be steady.

792
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,960
Don't move.

793
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,680
God Yang.

794
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,160
Help me to squat in the grass.

795
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,520
Okay.

796
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,360
Coming.

797
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,680
Go, go, go.

798
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,200
Go.

799
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,680
Go.

800
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,120
God Yang, why are you so aggressive?

801
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,600
God Yang, what are you doing?

802
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,440
It's okay.

803
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,840
Don't panic.

804
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,760
God Yang, don't go up.

805
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,040
Go.

806
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,760
I'm coming.

807
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,560
But the game is over.

808
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,840
The game is not over.

809
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,520
God Yang is going to lose.

810
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,480
Congratulations.

811
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,960
Cool.

812
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,400
Beautiful.

813
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,320
You're beautiful.

814
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,560
But what happened today?

815
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,960
Is it really not in its state?

816
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
God Yang, what are you doing?

817
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,600
Okay.

818
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,760
God Yang is back again.

819
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
He came to the wild.

820
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,520
But he doesn't know

821
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,680
that God Yang is hunting him.

822
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,000
God Yang suddenly killed him.

823
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,960
He saw the match.

824
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,360
He wants to kill God Yang again.

825
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,760
I can see that it's a very tacit understanding.

826
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,080
At the same time, God Yang is a little careless.

827
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,720
God Yang is going to die.

828
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,240
God Yang is also caught.

829
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
He's been killed by Ji Sha again.

830
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,960
God Yang's state is really not good today.

831
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,720
What are you doing today?

832
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
I guess it's a hand-pulled gold.

833
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,360
God Yang, please don't send me the data.

834
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,800
God Yang, please don't send me the data.

835
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,520
Don't change.

836
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,480
After this game,

837
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,640
we'll have a big game.

838
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,760
Let's have a game.

839
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,600
Let's have a big game.

840
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,240
Hand-pulled.

841
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,560
Hand-pulled.

842
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,160
The old man is ready.

843
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,680
He's here.

844
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,200
They're taking the stone.

845
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,280
Do you want to disturb them?

846
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,400
God Yang.

847
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
God Yang, let's play together.

848
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,920
God Yang is a very good man.

849
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,520
But he's a very good man.

850
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,560
He's in the left pit of the group.

851
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,240
He's going to hit three.

852
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
God Yang is a beautiful man again.

853
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,480
God Yang is so impulsive.

854
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,360
Fatty, follow me.

855
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
Old man is going to help the back.

856
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,320
Okay.

857
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,040
We're here.

858
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,440
Come on, retreat.

859
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,800
The ADC is here.

860
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,480
We can't hit him.

861
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
We can't hit him.

862
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,640
Brother Cheng, you're so good.

863
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,200
So, the girl is

864
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,280
the one who took the fox and the good man.

865
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,000
Fatty sent the old man and the little flower.

866
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,160
The old man and the good man

867
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,880
are looking at the big and beautiful

868
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,800
little girl.

869
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,040
They want to go.

870
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,720
They're going to take the stone.

871
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,320
The blue stone is like a wave.

872
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,120
Who's the one who looks like this?

873
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,760
The big one is going to push the high ground.

874
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,280
The big one is coming.

875
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,000
Go to the high ground.

876
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,280
Go to the high ground.

877
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,320
The first round is on.

878
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,240
The high ground is going to be in the middle.

879
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,160
We haven't touched yet.

880
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,240
Can we go to the high ground this time?

881
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,840
Beautiful.

882
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,480
The red ball is going to go to the front.

883
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,320
Go.

884
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,520
What's wrong with her?

885
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,720
What's wrong with her?

886
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,000
She's not picking up.

887
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,800
She's not even a little bit of a gold.

888
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,280
She's a former girlfriend.

889
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,200
She came to see the competition.

890
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,240
She must be stressed out.

891
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,760
Listen,

892
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,160
this time, the ZGDX

893
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,440
invited you to see the competition.

894
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,600
Is there any premonition?

895
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,920
Go, go, go.

896
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,080
Take away all your weird dreams.

897
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,800
Help me hold it.

898
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,680
I'll go to the bathroom.

899
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,720
Did you go to the bathroom?

900
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,240
Not good.

901
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,960
Feng Yao.

902
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,280
Sorry, sorry.

903
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,760
Feng Yao.

904
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,680
What a coincidence.

905
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,280
Why are you in Shanghai?

906
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,400
Who came to see my competition?

907
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,240
You?

908
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,760
I saw you just now.

909
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,640
So I thought you'd come to the bathroom.

910
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,480
I was waiting for you here.

911
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,240
What's the matter?

912
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,160
Nothing.

913
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,040
I just wanted to ask you.

914
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,360
How have you been?

915
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,280
I'm fine.

916
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
You're still blaming me?

917
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,840
I didn't call you back then.

918
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,880
We were in a hurry.

919
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,000
I took my phone up.

920
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,040
I put it on the coach's side.

921
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,160
Jian Yang, I didn't blame you.

922
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,400
I just wanted to tell you in a peaceful way.

923
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,640
We're done.

924
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,000
You don't need to explain this to me.

925
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,960
No, Yao Yao.

926
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,120
Don't.

927
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,840
Stop.

928
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,000
Don't call me that.

929
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,280
I'm listening to you.

930
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,080
Do you have anything to say?

931
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,640
If there's nothing, I'll go first.

932
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,040
Feng Yao.

933
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,640
No, you're a girl.

934
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,000
You came here to see my competition.

935
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Why did you come here?

936
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,760
I don't need to explain it to you.

937
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,120
But I still want to tell you

938
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,040
that I came here

939
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,000
because of ZGDX.

940
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,280
Stop kidding.

941
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,000
Why did you come here with a girl?

942
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,920
Jian Yang, why are you still here?

943
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,680
Why can't you come here with a girl?

944
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
You're still embarrassed

945
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
by the operation of that evil eye.

946
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,760
And you're still talking about me here.

947
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,840
The winner is...

948
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,080
The winner is...

949
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,000
Why did Yang Chen choose

950
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,600
the winner of the competition?

951
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,960
Why did he choose the winner

952
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,080
of the competition

953
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,840
in the case of the real master?

954
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,400
Yes.

955
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
Because the god of the ten thousand years

956
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,520
is very precise

957
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,880
in terms of operation and opening time.

958
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,320
If your ex-wife doesn't make a good choice,

959
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,920
the back-up and the c-weight

960
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,360
are actually very difficult.

961
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,480
If ZGDX doesn't make a good choice,

962
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,760
it's hard to make a good choice.

963
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,120
Go.

964
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,000
Don't push forward.

965
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,560
Do it.

966
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,600
Go back.

967
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,280
Follow her.

968
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,440
The other side is starting to get angry.

969
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,720
The god of the ten thousand years, be careful.

970
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,840
Okay, Dali.

971
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,600
I'll go to the doctor.

972
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:30,840
You go first.

973
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,080
We're still very cautious.

974
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,880
Is the god of the ten thousand years

975
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,200
the reason for the injury?

976
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,580
Old K,

977
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,560
he isn't in Zijia yet.

978
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,520
You need to careful.

979
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:41,960
Okay.

980
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,200
Do the devil come?

981
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
We got theák Delhi SURF.

982
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,600
He's here.

983
00:36:49,120 --> 00:37:05,460
blood 5

984
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,800
Whereas Liang Sheng think he would harm trespass in us...

985
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,780
Xiao Hua went up to help a очерitur.

986
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,880
OK.

987
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,960
Xiao Hua!

988
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,040
Liang Sheng opened the gate!

989
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,800
Xiao Hua!

990
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,520
search!

991
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,360
【The volunteer team has to think about their strategy】

992
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,880
【How about the next takedown】

993
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,560
【The first takedown arrives!】

994
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,680
【As expected, the team leader will feel ashamed to assemble the takedown!】

995
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,360
That's not right, why are you joining them?

996
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,040
【The takedown appears!】

997
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,960
【No one understands the셀開腳式挖得ball!】

998
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,120
【Black andозможно我們isi將來的教果會上升於皇上兩臺】

999
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,760
We tried again.

1000
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,760
This is the gala!

1001
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,040
You'remberly number one!

1002
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,220
악

1003
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,600
What's it?

1004
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,300
Inside corner?

1005
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,060
Shemen?

1006
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,000
Or shenggi?

1007
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,640
Shiness103 looking?

1008
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,440
One more.

1009
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:57,840
yi

1010
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,540
no

1011
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,100
can slip

1012
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,320
zheng

1013
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,840
yi

1014
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,560
yi

1015
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,440
yi

1016
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:02,640
yi

1017
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,340
The kids look outfits

1018
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,580
Drank

1019
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,240
ay

1020
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,780
here

1021
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,580
It's okay to hold the live stream.

1022
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,580
It's time for us to fight.

1023
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,700
Let's fight or fight.

1024
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,540
Yang Chen, the decision is made.

1025
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,740
Otherwise, it's too late.

1026
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,540
Fight.

1027
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,500
MK is not strong enough.

1028
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,180
I'm going to fight.

1029
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,300
K, help them.

1030
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,380
Here comes the speedy fight.

1031
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,180
Yang Chen, they're chasing.

1032
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,300
Are you ready?

1033
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,140
Ready to fight.

1034
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,060
Yang Chen, open the gate.

1035
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,140
The small group is ready.

1036
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,860
The leader is dead.

1037
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,700
Be careful.

1038
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,180
The final battle of the group is still in progress.

1039
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,380
Yang Chen is dead.

1040
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,340
It's still slow.

1041
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,620
Yang Chen, he's dead.

1042
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,980
Yang Chen, I'm also dead.

1043
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,140
I'm also dead.

1044
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,060
Yang Chen,

1045
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,420
the leader is dead.

1046
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,740
The leader is taken away by the girl.

1047
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,260
If we can fight in advance,

1048
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,740
we can still fight against this injury.

1049
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,260
This is the first round of the ZCK.

1050
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,300
Yang Chen, the second group.

1051
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,100
The second group,

1052
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,740
kill them.

1053
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,580
The ZCK is dead.

1054
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,220
Okay, the third group has been defeated.

1055
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,980
The ZCK is dead.

1056
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,780
The ZCK is not slow enough.

1057
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,860
The ZCK has no chance to attack.

1058
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,380
Congratulations, ZCK.

1059
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,780
The second group is defeated.

1060
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,100
It's 1-1.

1061
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,740
Yes.

1062
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,580
Nice.

1063
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:05,900
Nice.

1064
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,860
The leader is dead.

1065
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,620
Come on.

1066
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,420
Nice.

1067
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,300
Nice.

1068
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,420
Okay, the third group is also officially started.

1069
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,500
Yang Chen is also very serious about the God of Famility.

1070
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,340
If you don't go to catch him,

1071
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,740
you can catch him on the way.

1072
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,300
Old Mao, Old K.

1073
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:25,980
Come and help me.

1074
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,580
Coming.

1075
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,540
Come on.

1076
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,220
Be careful.

1077
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,980
Be careful.

1078
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,940
Go back.

1079
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,300
The ZCK is now in the middle of the city.

1080
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,860
Old K, come back.

1081
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,740
The leader is dead.

1082
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,980
The ZCK is back.

1083
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,220
God of Famility killed Xiao Hua.

1084
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
This group is so funny.

1085
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,780
It's a chance.

1086
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,380
Go for it.

1087
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,740
Yes.

1088
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,180
Come on.

1089
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,940
Let's go.

1090
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,060
I didn't expect that

1091
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,660
the God of Famility is not so good.

1092
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,420
Come on, Chuan.

1093
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,220
Come with me.

1094
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,380
Come on.

1095
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,620
The ZCK is in the middle of the city.

1096
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,620
Ready to go for the God of Famility.

1097
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,140
If Chuan takes the God of Famility,

1098
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,900
I think the champion of the spring game

1099
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,300
will be the leader of the wolf.

1100
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,100
Yang Chen, go for it.

1101
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,780
I'll go.

1102
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,380
Go.

1103
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,140
Go for it.

1104
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,980
God of Famility,

1105
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,700
stand on his left.

1106
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,260
Okay.

1107
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,620
God of Famility,

1108
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,420
God of Famility,

1109
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,140
the other group of ZCK is also in the middle of the city.

1110
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,460
The ZCK is now in the middle of the city.

1111
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,060
He's dead.

1112
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,500
Hurry.

1113
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,020
Go for it.

1114
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,820
Go for it.

1115
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,140
It's a chance.

1116
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,900
It's a beautiful and beautiful city.

1117
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,940
He's a champion.

1118
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,020
He's at the top of the city.

1119
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,740
Hanyuan, come to the left.

1120
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,940
Rock, paper, scissors.

1121
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,060
They got the ZCK and want to retreat.

1122
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,660
I'm going to do my job.

1123
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,340
You guys retreat.

1124
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,660
The ZCK is now in the middle of the city.

1125
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,900
The ZCK is now in the middle of the city.

1126
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,820
Let's protect the ZCK first.

1127
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,540
Okay.

1128
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,620
Two people, get in the circle.

1129
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:29,940
Come on.

1130
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,660
Go for it.

1131
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,060
Come on.

1132
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,500
The enemy is coming.

1133
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,100
The enemy is in this place.

1134
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,100
Is his hand hurt?

1135
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,900
The black-headed man is slowly moving forward.

1136
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,500
He's looking for a spot.

1137
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
The black-headed man is controlling the red-headed man.

1138
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
The enemy is coming.

1139
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Be careful.

1140
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,100
I know.

1141
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,900
If we don't get the speed,

1142
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,700
the big move shouldn't be good.

1143
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,300
This is risky.

1144
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,500
Uncle Wang, hurry up.

1145
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,100
The attack from the company's side.

1146
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,500
The old Wang Tong is in the middle of the battle.

1147
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,100
The only thing left is Jian Yang and Lu Si Cheng.

1148
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,700
Let's go to the warehouse.

1149
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,700
Jian Yang is in the warehouse.

1150
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,500
The enemy is about to die.

1151
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,900
Jian Yang is going to kill him.

1152
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,300
My goodness.

1153
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
This is so unfortunate.

1154
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,700
The enemy is in the middle of the battle.

1155
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,500
The enemy is in the high ground.

1156
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,900
The enemy is in the middle of the battle.

1157
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,300
We see that the enemy is about to revive.

1158
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
Is there any chance for the enemy to die?

1159
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,700
One shot.

1160
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,100
The enemy is about to revive.

1161
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,300
No chance.

1162
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,700
Congratulations to the enemy.

1163
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,300
Congratulations to the enemy.

1164
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,500
Congratulations to the enemy.

1165
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,300
Congratulations to the enemy.

1166
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,700
Congratulations to the enemy.

1167
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:55,900
Congratulations to the enemy.

1168
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,300
Are you okay?

1169
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,300
I dragged you.

1170
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

1171
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,900
Congratulations to the enemy.

1172
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,300
Congratulations to the enemy.

1173
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,500
Let's go.

1174
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,500
What's wrong?

1175
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,700
Why is he back?

1176
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,500
What's wrong?

1177
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Sit down.

1178
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,900
Today,

1179
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,700
I have something to say to you.

1180
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,500
Maybe some people already know.

1181
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,700
I...

1182
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,900
I still decided

1183
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,300
to go to the warehouse.

1184
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,900
I will go to the warehouse.

1185
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,300
I will go to the warehouse.

1186
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,900
I still decided to say goodbye to this stage.

1187
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,500
A few years ago,

1188
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,100
I was still a newbie in the professional team.

1189
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,700
Right.

1190
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,100
When I was as old as you,

1191
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,500
at that time,

1192
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,700
in most people's eyes,

1193
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,500
playing games is not a business.

1194
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,100
There is no future.

1195
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,300
Of course,

1196
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,500
our family members are also like that.

1197
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,500
They will ask me questions in front of them.

1198
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,900
What is the power?

1199
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,100
Is there a future?

1200
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,500
At that time,

1201
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,700
I really don't know how to answer them.

1202
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,900
But seeing their eyes,

1203
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,100
I am very unhappy.

1204
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,900
Because my heart tells me

1205
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,500
that this is my dream.

1206
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,100
The professional team will have a bright future.

1207
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,300
For this,

1208
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,900
I have fought with my family members.

1209
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,300
I have been cold-hearted.

1210
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,700
I even went to the train station in Shenzhen

1211
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,700
without saying goodbye.

1212
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,500
I came to the ZGDX team

1213
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,100
to become a professional computer player.

1214
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,100
In this short and long time,

1215
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,500
I have fought with our team members,

1216
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,900
Old Cat, Old K, and Little Fat.

1217
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,300
We have fallen down and climbed up.

1218
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,100
I also found the position and direction

1219
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
in this time and time,

1220
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,900
in the honor and the valley.

1221
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,500
But unfortunately,

1222
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,100
today,

1223
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,900
I have to let my dream go.

1224
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,900
Today, the failure of this competition

1225
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,300
is also telling me the truth.

1226
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,300
It is time to let go and only move on to my own persistence.

1227
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,500
To give those fresh blood and stomachs.

1228
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,100
Although I can't do it,

1229
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,300
I know that as long as the dream is not there,

1230
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,300
someone will stand on the stage of this competition and take me

1231
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,900
and carry on with my dream.

1232
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,500
And this person,

1233
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,500
I hope he can make a decision as soon as possible.

1234
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,500
I hope one day,

1235
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,100
when our ZGDX team won the trophy,

1236
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,900
I will still be there.

1237
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,900
You will also be there.

1238
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,300
Now, I,

1239
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,300
Yu Min,

1240
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,100
ZGDX team's members,

1241
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,300
will officially leave

1242
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,500
after this spring festival.

1243
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,300
Why did you come to see me?

1244
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,700
Why do you suddenly want to see me?

1245
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,700
I really want to see you.

1246
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,900
I really want to see you.

1247
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,300
Ming Shen, come on!

1248
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,300
Ming Shen, come on!

1249
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,700
Ming Shen, we will always support you!

1250
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,700
Come on!

1251
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,700
Come on!

1252
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,700
Come on!

1253
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
Come on!

1254
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,700
Come on!

1255
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,700
I'm going to join the GDX team.

1256
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
Come on!

1257
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,700
Come on!

1258
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,700
Come on!

1259
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,700
Excuse me.

1260
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,700
What's the matter?

1261
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,700
Tong Yao!

1262
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,700
Excuse me.

1263
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,700
I'll wait for you at the door. If anything happens, remember to call me.

1264
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
I really care about you.

1265
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,700
That's why I told you earlier. Why did you join the GDX team?

1266
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,700
Who are you?

1267
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,700
You're not the same as the boss.

1268
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
Who are you?

1269
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,700
Why are you so close to Yang Shen?

1270
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,700
That's right.

1271
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,700
Let's go.

1272
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
Let go.

1273
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,700
Are you serious?

1274
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,700
You really joined the GDX team?

1275
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,700
Yes.

1276
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,700
You should have been promoted.

1277
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,700
You were against me playing the professional team.

1278
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Why did you join the GDX team?

1279
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,700
I'm happy. Do you care about me?

1280
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,700
I don't care about you. I'm used to it.

1281
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,700
Why didn't you tell me you joined the GDX team?

1282
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,700
You joined the GDX team,

1283
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,700
why did you tell me?

1284
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,700
Why did I join the GDX team?

1285
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,700
Because we have me.

1286
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,700
Ask me again.

1287
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,700
I taught you the game.

1288
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,700
I gave you the key part of your computer.

1289
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,700
If you want to play professional, you should join the GDX team.

1290
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,700
Brother,

1291
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,700
I've said it many times.

1292
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,700
I don't have any relationship with you.

1293
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,700
You taught me to play the game.

1294
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,700
What? You want to take the tuition?

1295
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,700
Tong Yang, you want to piss me off?

1296
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,700
Jian Yang, you just need to play your professional game.

1297
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,700
Look at the operation of the first three-way delivery.

1298
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,700
It's so bad.

1299
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,700
It's not good?

1300
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,700
You should tell me earlier that you signed them.

1301
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,700
You can continue to deliver them.

1302
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,700
I'll give you a gift.

1303
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,700
It's good for you to give a champion to Dong Jia.

1304
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,700
What champion? Do you need to deliver them?

1305
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,700
I don't have the strength to take them.

1306
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,700
Yang Yang, let's have a good talk.

1307
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
You joined the GDX team.

1308
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,700
Are you angry with me?

1309
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,700
I've said it many times.

1310
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,700
Playing professional is my dream.

1311
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,700
It has nothing to do with you.

1312
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,700
Fine. Since that's the case,

1313
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,700
I won't take the favor of the game.

1314
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,700
Okay. See you at the game.

1315
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,700
Brother Chen, why are you here?
