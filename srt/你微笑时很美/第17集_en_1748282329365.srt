1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
I'm a true heroine of the only one of you.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,800
Recently, I've been a star.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,200
The man of the noble circle, Chessman,

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,800
finally appeared in the first place.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Smiling!

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
The fanatic, Da Ye Kun,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,800
appeared in the audience.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
I didn't expect that the last time I caught Smiling,

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,400
we had a reason to suspect you.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,000
There were some unspeakable people.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Miss, you're cute.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,400
Of course, the most shameless one

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,200
was the one who won the gold medal in the competition.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,600
And the solo contest of ZGDX 2C.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,400
Come on, let's go.

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Solo.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,400
Excuse me.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Who is this guy?

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm a fan of ZGDX 2C.

47
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
What?

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
I just slept in a tent.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
How could I miss such a long solo show?

50
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Oh, my god.

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
My ears are almost deaf.

52
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
And?

53
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
You won the game.

54
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
And?

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Don't tell me you're deaf.

56
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,400
I knew Lu Si Chen would like you.

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
He must have given it to you on purpose.

58
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Do you think so?

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,400
In Yan Qing's novel and fans' eyes,

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
it's true.

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
He gave it to me on purpose.

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
But the problem is

63
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I can feel it when I'm in a relationship with him.

64
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
He didn't give up at all.

65
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
He just wants to win me.

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Maybe I won because I'm more familiar with

67
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
the roadside line and the terrain than him.

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Zhuang, you continue.

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm hanging up.

70
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
No, it's true.

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
And...

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Forget it.

73
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I don't know what's going on.

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I told you.

75
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Don't be casual.

76
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
What?

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
You're not in a relationship with professional players?

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You're not even in a relationship with him?

79
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Where's Brother Cheng?

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
What did he say?

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
You searched me and you didn't ask him anything?

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Why?

83
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
We're all teammates.

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,400
What if I make a bad move

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
and I'm rejected?

86
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
How will we play the game in the future?

87
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
How dare you?

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
You're thinking too much.

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I didn't think about it with Ai Jia.

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
We're teammates.

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Compared to the result,

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I still want to play the game well.

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I don't want to be told that

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
you girls are here to get a job

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
just to be famous or to find a man.

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Okay, sister.

97
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm all in the same mood with you.

98
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I didn't expect

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
our Sha Tiao girl to grow up.

100
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
What else?

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
But as a person,

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
I want to give you a word.

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
In this situation,

104
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
women shouldn't act recklessly.

105
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
No one can force their thoughts.

106
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Really?

107
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Yes.

108
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
But if

109
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
they don't act recklessly,

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
then you might think too much.

111
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Okay.

112
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Bye.

113
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Brother Cheng, you haven't left yet?

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Didn't you say that

115
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:36,400
your blind date

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
is the last time you meet?

117
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
What time is it?

118
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Why don't you pack up and get ready to leave?

119
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
What's wrong?

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
You're not going?

121
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Didn't someone say that you don't want me to go?

122
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Who?

123
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
You're so sleepy.

124
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
You...

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
You heard it all?

126
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
You Bulong.

127
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Then why did you pretend to be...

128
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I want to be face.

129
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm not.

130
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I...

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I just want to say it casually.

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
I'm just afraid that you might be distracted.

133
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Think about it.

134
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
All of them hope that

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
they can win the champion award this year.

136
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
And...

137
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
the champion skin...

138
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
The skin is called yellow.

139
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Bingbing.

140
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Bingbing.

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
You're here.

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Let's go.

143
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Let's eat some canned food.

144
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
What's wrong?

145
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
What are you two talking about?

146
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
What's the point of calling me yellow?

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Nothing.

148
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm going back to my room.

149
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
You're not going out?

150
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm not going.

151
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
You're putting the pigeon in again?

152
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I said I'll change to the chicken farm.

153
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I don't need to drive out.

154
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
There's no connection between the electronic system.

155
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Our goal this year is to win the champion in the national championship.

156
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
It's good to know.

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Let's go, Bingbing.

158
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Go to the canteen.

159
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Old Feng.

160
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm tired.

161
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
I'll show you the chicken farm.

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Look.

163
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
They're both my friends.

164
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Brother Cheng.

165
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Solo lost on purpose.

166
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Why did I lose on purpose?

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
God Yang told me.

168
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Why did you lose?

169
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
I also explain to you why I failed.

170
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Do you want me to write a hundred times and give you a review?

171
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
The whole world sees that you lost on purpose.

172
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
No.

173
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
He got the chance to catch the ice-cream.

174
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,400
You don't think you'll make a mistake like this.

175
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
I've never seen a drunk mother.

176
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm not a god.

177
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I won't make a mistake.

178
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Besides, why did I lose to him on purpose?

179
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
It's not your fault.

180
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Anyway, I saw the tenderness.

181
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Are you blind?

182
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
We can't see the high-level trick in the middle.

183
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Besides, he won me now.

184
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
He's trying to replace me with a team.

185
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
He's asking for...

186
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
What?

187
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
What does he mean?

188
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
He's testing the new girl.

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I really can't understand why men like to test the new girl so much.

190
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,400
You like to be a little boy who likes to be a little girl.

191
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
What's the point?

192
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Okay, I'm leaving.

193
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Bye.

194
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
What?

195
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Someone will come to you later.

196
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
No.

197
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I'll see the weather.

198
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I'll go out and eat some snacks.

199
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
No need.

200
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
You can buy it when you come back.

201
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Miss Su.

202
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
I've said it before.

203
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
We're not suitable.

204
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Lu Si Cheng.

205
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Are you unhappy that I went to the competition?

206
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
You think I'm too high-key?

207
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I didn't mean it.

208
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,400
How did those people ask me?

209
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm sorry.

212
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
I didn't know you were so famous.

213
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
I didn't know

214
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
they would analyze my words so deeply.

215
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Now your fans have been making trouble.

216
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm really sorry.

217
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
They even found my Weibo.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
It's really hard to hear someone talk.

219
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
They said I was shameless

220
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
and pretended to be your girlfriend.

221
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm sorry.

222
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Why are you apologizing?

223
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
It's not your fault.

224
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
It's your fans.

225
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Although I don't know

226
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
the things in your game circle,

227
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
if I can develop it,

228
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I can learn and understand it.

229
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
It has nothing to do with this.

230
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I don't know if Lu Yue told you

231
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
what's so good about it.

232
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
There's a rule in this circle.

233
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
You don't need to be polite.

234
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
If I want it,

235
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I'll protect it.

236
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
So it has nothing to do with this.

237
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Are you afraid of

238
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
the fans' sadness?

239
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm not a entertainment idol.

240
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm a TV star.

241
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm not a good actor.

242
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm not a good actor.

243
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm a good actor.

244
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm young.

245
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm not a good actor.

246
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
So what?

247
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
We're not suitable.

248
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
What do you mean?

249
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Family affairs,

250
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
appearance, intelligence,

251
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
or height?

252
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Dad.

253
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
They can be together.

254
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Isn't it great?

255
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Bye.

256
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
This little girl

257
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
can be her daughter.

258
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
What kind of person do you like?

259
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
People who are better than me.

260
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Isn't it all the blood of the noisy?

261
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
No.

262
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Is there really such a person?

263
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I heard you're good at playing games.

264
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
No one is better than you.

265
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
It's not necessarily

266
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
better than me playing the game.

267
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
I'm better than me playing the game.

268
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
If it's just about playing the game,

269
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
I'll just marry you.

270
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Goodbye.

271
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Why isn't Chen back yet?

272
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
He's not that hot.

273
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
He's gone last night.

274
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Yes.

275
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
He's been doing this for

276
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
more than 20 minutes.

277
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
That's right.

278
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I'm starving to death.

279
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
No.

280
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
I want to go see him.

281
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
What for?

282
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
You're in a dangerous situation this month.

283
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
You should be on guard.

284
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
What?

285
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
What are you talking about?

286
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm not on guard.

287
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
What are you talking about?

288
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I'm not on guard.

289
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
I'm not on guard.

290
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
I'm not on guard.

291
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I'm not on guard.

292
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
What are you talking about?

293
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm not on guard.

294
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
It's all your fault for calling me to see you.

295
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Don't be so hard on me.

296
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
How about I go see him?

297
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Okay. Go ahead.

298
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
What are you looking at?

299
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
A number.

300
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
You're so good at playing games.

301
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
I...

302
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm not good at playing games.

303
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm not good at playing games.

304
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,440
Don't get skewn by crime

305
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
or farming這麼 gravely用.

306
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Tell me he growl

307
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,640
Defy the white λέ

308
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,480
What?

309
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,900
You're scaring me.

310
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,840
Fatty said she was hungry.

311
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,080
She asked me to recommend you to buy crayfish.

312
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,080
Well,

313
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,880
you're a close friend.

314
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,240
Let's go.

315
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,280
Let's go.

316
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,240
Let's go.

317
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Drive to buy crayfish.

318
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,640
Drive?

319
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,040
The shop is in Chengnan.

320
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,120
I said it earlier.

321
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,480
I won't run away.

322
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,720
You didn't ask me to chase you.

323
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,480
You...

324
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,360
Drive.

325
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,120
Drive.

326
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,760
Drive.

327
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,360
Drive.

328
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,000
Drive.

329
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,680
Drive.

330
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,320
Drive.

331
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,160
Drive.

332
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,840
Drive.

333
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,560
Drive.

334
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,400
Drive.

335
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,240
Drive.

336
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,000
Drive.

337
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,800
Drive.

338
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,560
Drive.

339
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,200
Drive.

340
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,960
Drive.

341
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,840
Drive.

342
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,640
Drive.

343
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,480
Drive.

344
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,400
Drive.

345
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,080
Sir,

346
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,480
you're going to buy crayfish

347
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,280
and a girlfriend

348
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,360
to make friends at home?

349
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,600
It's not a girlfriend.

350
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,320
It's a teammate.

351
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,560
A teammate?

352
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,960
I think he's looking at you.

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,240
Not a boyfriend's eyes,

354
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,520
but a husband's eyes.

355
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,560
I think she likes you.

356
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,880
If you don't like her,

357
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,760
just say

358
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,320
don't hurt her heart.

359
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's go.

360
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,920
What did you say to Fuyuan?

361
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,160
Why are you smiling so sweetly?

362
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,640
You have a disease.

363
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,960
Did she hit you?

364
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,760
No.

365
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,240
Then why are you smiling so happily?

366
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
She said you look like

367
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,560
a friend of mine

368
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,200
and you're looking for a friend.

369
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
No way.

370
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,240
Fuyuan won't be that boring.

371
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,440
Have a rest.

372
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,840
What's wrong with you?

373
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,120
Your hand hurts.

374
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,560
Your hand hurts?

375
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,080
It's been a long time since I hit her.

376
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,280
And she's an A-d.

377
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,480
She has a normal hand injury.

378
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,280
She's just old.

379
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,200
If she's not used to heavy things,

380
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,800
then...

381
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,240
What are you doing?

382
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,720
Why didn't you say it earlier?

383
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,280
What's there to say?

384
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,360
I'm old and old.

385
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,280
I'm not disabled.

386
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,840
Give it to me.

387
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,880
No.

388
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,920
My mom has been

389
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,760
taking care of me at home.

390
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,600
It's not that bad.

391
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,800
Just wait for me here.

392
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,680
Hey.

393
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,600
Lu Siqiang, open the door.

394
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
You're so kind.

395
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,640
What?

396
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,440
It's the first time I've been taken care of by a girl.

397
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,360
But I'm not a girl.

398
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,920
Anyway,

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,760
thank you.

400
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,640
Let's go.

401
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,120
Wash thefan.

402
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,440
Do not师 Mao stop him.

403
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
Go to Ru carbohydrate coconut.

404
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,120
To Finished Deguna section.

405
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
Yes.

406
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,200
Take them home.

407
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,240
Go.

408
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,240
At this point,

409
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll have it back to

410
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
someone else.

411
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,440
I'll give that to her.

412
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,120
I definitely will.

413
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,440
Nope.

414
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,240
What?

415
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,760
Someone came to me tolay this.

416
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,480
Who was it?

417
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,560
After all,

418
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,400
Yes.

419
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,280
You're not a girl who's so red.

420
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,320
You look like you know the way.

421
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,880
You're not worried about me.

422
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,120
I can see that.

423
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,360
I have a girlfriend.

424
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,280
You don't?

425
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,520
You do.

426
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,880
Niannian,

427
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,360
do you want to know what..

428
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:19,580
What is this guy, are you

429
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,260
trying to seduce her...

430
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,300
And still Mitake?

431
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,260
Yes.

432
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
The team will deal with Liao Shilamu every month.

433
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,960
Brother Cheng.

434
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I seem to...

435
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,560
Do you want to listen to the hook?

436
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Don't worry.

437
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
I will take care of you.

438
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,560
The most beautiful woman in the world.

439
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Look at this.

440
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
I have at least one person in my life.

441
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Look at this.

442
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Ruiyao Weixun.

443
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
The favorite thing in Zhongnan.

444
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,560
The lady in Zhongnan said that weixun is perfect for eating shrimp.

445
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
What are you doing?

446
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Look at others.

447
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
What are you talking about?

448
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
I just want to turn my head to you.

449
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
You are a dead fat man.

450
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Let me show you.

451
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,560
This is a 150-60 yuan discount.

452
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
The bubble before the main meat is all the bubbles.

453
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
It's not moving.

454
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
The heart is fast.

455
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
It's broken.

456
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
You...

457
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Okay, okay.

458
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I won't talk to you.

459
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
The power of eating shrimp affects the live broadcast.

460
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
Don't forget.

461
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,560
The gift is to be brushed.

462
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Why don't you eat?

463
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
It's a little troublesome.

464
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
It's easy to leave a taste.

465
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
It's not going to be gone for two days.

466
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
It's too bad.

467
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
The idol is going to be heavy.

468
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Unless you peel the shrimp well and put it in the bowl.

469
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
You think you can eat the boiled shrimp with the shrimp?

470
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Someone else will serve you.

471
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
You saw me peel it.

472
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
I didn't put the medicine in.

473
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
You eat it.

474
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I'll eat it.

475
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Drink some more.

476
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Hurry up.

477
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Hurry up.

478
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
How is it?

479
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I said drink some more.

480
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Why did you do that?

481
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
It's perfect.

482
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Do you want more?

483
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Do you like peeling shrimp?

484
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I want to say that I don't like it.

485
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
The money you paid,

486
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
at least let me taste it.

487
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
It's a gift.

488
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
It's not a joke.

489
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Brother Cheng.

490
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
You two are soloing all day.

491
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
You're playing the piano and scolding me at night.

492
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
You're so beautiful.

493
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Fatty,

494
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
do you dare to turn your head?

495
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Let us have a look.

496
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
I don't want to know what happened.

497
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
What should I do?

498
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
I can't turn my head if I don't turn.

499
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Who is giving me a chance?

500
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Who is giving me a chance?

501
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
You can look at me.

502
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Who is giving me a chance?

503
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
You two just look at me.

504
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Who is giving you a chance?

505
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
You two are being so mean.

506
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Shut up.

507
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
The club just called me.

508
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
They asked us to participate in the activity.

509
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
There is still a competition.

510
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
What activity do you want to participate in?

511
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Brother Cheng,

512
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
you have been refusing to come to the club recently.

513
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
The staff at the club have thrown the lighter away.

514
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
The other activities

515
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
can be used to kill the enemy.

516
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
I can push the other activities.

517
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
I can push them all.

518
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
But this time,

519
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
the activity of the club

520
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
is already signed by the club.

521
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
So...

522
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
The competition is so full.

523
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
How can we go to the club?

524
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Go back to the club that day.

525
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
What the club wants is

526
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
to go to the airport directly after the competition.

527
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
Then we can fly back

528
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
after the club is done.

529
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Won't you go?

530
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Then we have to find Mrs. Lu.

531
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Tell the club

532
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
this is the last time.

533
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Let's continue our show.

534
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
I want it.

535
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Why did you prominent out?

536
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
How can I be suitable?

537
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Why should I particularly call you?

538
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Our club just called to provide

539
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
a place for you.

540
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,760
Ta-da! Breakfast is ready!

541
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,560
Wow, Brother Rui!

542
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,360
You finally found out that I didn't eat breakfast!

543
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
What are you talking about?

544
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,760
I'm telling you a truth with practical actions.

545
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,560
I've already eaten birds and birds.

546
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,760
If there's such a delicious panini every day,

547
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,560
I think I can borrow a bed.

548
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,360
If a breakfast can make you not sleep,

549
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I really am willing to be your breakfast manager.

550
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,760
Come, come, come. Look over here.

551
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,160
One, two, three!

552
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,560
What are you doing?

553
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,360
I'm taking a photo to send it to Miss Guan.

554
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,760
I want her to take a look and remember to take a look at the breakfast.

555
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,560
I'm willing to be your breakfast manager.

556
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
What are you talking about?

557
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,960
Brother Rui, what activity is it today?

558
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
I don't know. I'm not going to arrange it.

559
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,760
Brother Cheng!

560
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
Sorry, sorry!

561
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,160
Brother Cheng, I'm sorry for the makeup.

562
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,760
Please help me understand.

563
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
Sorry, I don't need to.

564
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,960
Brother Cheng, please help us understand.

565
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Brother Cheng, please help us understand.

566
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,960
Brother Cheng.

567
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,160
Yes, please help us understand.

568
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Please help us understand.

569
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,960
Then you can go to the small store.

570
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,760
Okay, okay, okay.

571
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,160
Everyone, hurry up.

572
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,560
Brother Cheng.

573
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Brother Cheng.

574
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,960
Brother Cheng has been up so early today.

575
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,160
I didn't expect that he would be so patient.

576
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,560
Brother Cheng is an old warrior.

577
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
Is he trying to be stolen by the fans of Wu Zhi?

578
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,960
Is he too cold?

579
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Brother Cheng, my, my.

580
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,760
Thank you.

581
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,360
I want to borrow you.

582
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,560
Yes, here.

583
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Here, my.

584
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,960
Here, this is my.

585
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Here, help me sign it.

586
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,760
Thank you.

587
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,960
Thank you, thank you.

588
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Thank you, Brother Cheng.

589
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,560
Thank you.

590
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Here, my.

591
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Thank you.

592
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Thank you.

593
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,360
Thank you.

594
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,960
Brother Cheng, it's done.

595
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
There's no time.

596
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Everyone, hurry up.

597
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,960
Thank you.

598
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Thank you.

599
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,560
Help me sign it.

600
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Brother Cheng, please sign it.

601
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,760
Miss, please sign it for me.

602
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
Here.

603
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Thank you.

604
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
Here, please sign it for me.

605
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Thank you.

606
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Here, this.

607
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,160
So handsome.

608
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,760
You're so handsome in this photo.

609
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,960
Thank you.

610
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,560
Miss, please sign it for me.

611
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
And this.

612
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Thank you.

613
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Thank you, Brother Cheng.

614
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Thank you, Brother Cheng.

615
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Thank you, Brother Cheng.

616
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Here, my.

617
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Here, my.

618
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Here, please sign it.

619
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Here.

620
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Thank you.

621
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Miss, please sign it for me.

622
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Thank you.

623
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Thank you, Brother Cheng.

624
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
I've been here for three times.

625
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Thank you, Brother Cheng.

626
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
You just signed it for me.

627
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
This is for my friend.

628
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Thank you.

629
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Anyway, you don't have to delay for long.

630
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Just sign it.

631
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Brother Cheng.

632
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Please sign it for me.

633
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Brother Wei.

634
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
What's wrong?

635
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
He's been here for three times.

636
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Is there anything else?

637
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Okay, I'll take care of it.

638
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Okay.

639
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Excuse me.

640
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
We're running out of time.

641
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Why don't you sign it?

642
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
It's just a signature.

643
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
What's the point of signing it?

644
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Well done.

645
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,560
These people want to show off with their friends.

646
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Who can I see at the backstage?

647
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Do you want to sign it for you?

648
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
Then you came here to sign it.

649
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Actually,

650
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
I don't know what you're doing.

651
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
I just know you're a celebrity.

652
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
It's all set. I'll go first.

653
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Do you know?

654
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
I'm a diet.

655
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
You're not my...

656
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
I'm not your diet.

657
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
You're a celebrity.

658
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
I think I know.

659
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
I'm a celebrity.

660
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
I should have seen him.

661
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
I should have seen him.

662
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Look.

663
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
This is our schedule.

664
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
We need you to cooperate.

665
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Please prepare.

666
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Let the team members

667
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
take the ball from the left side of the stage

668
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
to the right side of the stage.

669
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
The ball is the first to hit the ball.

670
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
It's a good chance.

671
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
I see.

672
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
It's totally a bad idea.

673
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
It's meaningless.

674
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Brother Rui.

675
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Have you seen this Liu Shunnan?

676
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Why is there such a game?

677
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Don't be anxious. Let me see.

678
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
This...

679
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Stop looking.

680
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Stop looking.

681
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,560
It's not good to be hugged like this.

682
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Yes.

683
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Yes.

684
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
The ball is too short.

685
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
We all eat by hand.

686
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
And we have injuries.

687
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
It's not good.

688
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
This game

689
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
is not good for us.

690
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
It's not good for us.

691
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Why don't we change it?

692
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Our props are ready.

693
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
The time is right.

694
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
You suddenly want to change it.

695
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Is it not good?

696
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
No. Look at this.

697
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
It's just a matter of a moment.

698
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
People will go through it.

699
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
We have a game tomorrow.

700
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
What if someone is injured?

701
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Who will go to the stage?

702
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
You?

703
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I say this girl.

704
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
You are so ugly from the beginning.

705
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
You are so hardworking.

706
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Didn't I tell you?

707
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
The props are ready.

708
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
The time is ready.

709
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
You can't change it.

710
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
No.

711
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Listen to me.

712
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
We have injuries in our hands.

713
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
This is...

714
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
We all take money to do things.

715
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Don't do anything more expensive than that.

716
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
If you are so unhappy,

717
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
don't come here.

718
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Don't take the money from the host.

719
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
You have to find tea here.

720
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
You play games.

721
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
Is it because of all these things?

722
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
My boyfriend is also a computer player.

723
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
I haven't seen him like you.

724
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
I can't even touch him.

725
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Some big guys

726
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
and dozens of gold girls

727
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
are living in the stage

728
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
and walking around.

729
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Do you want me to send a Weibo

730
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
to tell you that

731
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,560
your team is the most expensive?

732
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
What are you doing?

733
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
What are you talking about?

734
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Who are you threatening?

735
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
What? What?

736
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Who's threatening you?

737
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
No.

738
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
No.

739
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Don't touch me.

740
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Are you okay?

741
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Why are you still hitting others?

742
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
No.

743
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Why are you hitting me?

744
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Are you a bad person?

745
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Why are you hitting others?

746
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
I'm not hitting you.

747
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Let go of me.

748
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Let go of me.

749
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Why are you hitting me?

750
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Who are you?

751
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
I'm a mad woman.

752
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Did I hit you?

753
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
I'm a mad woman.

754
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Look, I'm a man.

755
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Who are you?

756
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
I'm a man.

757
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm a man.

758
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
I came to sleep.

759
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
I'm a man.

760
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Don't hit me.

761
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Are you okay?

762
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Are you okay?

763
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
I'm fine.

764
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm fine. Let's go first.

765
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Let's go first.

766
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm fine.

767
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Besides Tong Yao,

768
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
the others will go to the farm right away.

769
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Be careful.

770
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm fine.

771
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Now,

772
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
your favorite ZGDX

773
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
starting the game.

774
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Are you ready?

775
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm ready.

776
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Okay.

777
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Bye.

778
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Let's go.

779
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Come on.

780
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Come on.

781
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Okay.

782
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
I'm the winner.

783
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Let's welcome

784
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Chen Ge and Lao Ke.

785
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Chen Ge.

786
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Chen Ge.

787
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Chen Ge.

788
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Chen Ge.

789
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Chen Ge.

790
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
Chen Ge.

791
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
Chen Ge.

792
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Chen Ge.

793
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
It's okay.

794
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
My friend has come to pick me up.

795
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
There are many people here.

796
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,560
I've treated the wound.

797
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Thank you for your concern.

798
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,560
Nice and smooth.

799
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
What a normal girl!

800
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Either worse and scornful be salaries!

801
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
I'd suggest

802
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Wang Yu were important

803
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
to invite them

804
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
to performmaster and boss.

805
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
See?

806
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
No need to learn

807
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
to play with anyone.

808
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Instead,

809
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
I'll read something for you.

810
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,960
No one must know

811
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,880
I'm so excited.

812
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,240
No matter what, it's too much.

813
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,320
Luckily, you're fine.

814
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
Jia Qi is so gentle.

815
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,640
Seeing the same face,

816
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,920
I can tell that Su Zhi is happy.

817
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,240
I have your concern and support.

818
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,120
I'll recover soon.

819
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,800
Thank you, sir.

820
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,240
My dear.

821
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
I'm so sorry.

822
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
I'm sorry.

823
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
I'm sorry.

824
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
I'm sorry.

825
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
I'm sorry.

826
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
I'm sorry.

827
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,640
I've been in a relationship for a month.

828
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,520
I finally found out about her.

829
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,360
You tell me,

830
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,200
it's a fight.

831
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,080
The driver of the car,

832
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,120
Mr. Li,

833
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Thank you, sir.

834
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,960
I'm sorry.

835
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,800
Can you help me?

836
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,120
Please comment on the key words.

837
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,160
Yes, yes.

838
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
It's the fight.

839
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,960
No problem.

840
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm sorry.

841
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Thank you.

842
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Okay.

843
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Thank you.

844
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,480
Mr. Zhang, are you okay?

845
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,600
It's all our fault.

846
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,120
I'm sorry.

847
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,360
Mr. Zhang, I'm really sorry.

848
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm really sorry.

849
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,040
We must solve the plan.

850
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,880
Thank you, sir.

851
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,840
Mr. Li.

852
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,960
You're here.

853
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,080
I'm waiting for you.

854
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,360
Mr. Wang will be here soon.

855
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,680
You can talk to him.

856
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Lu.

857
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,840
Mr. Wang came here personally.

858
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,040
I thought...

859
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,240
What do you think?

860
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,080
You think it's not big enough?

861
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
No, no.

862
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
Mr. Wang.

863
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Mr. Wang.

864
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,080
You're Tong Yao, right?

865
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Yes.

866
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,080
Introduce yourself for the first time.

867
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
My name is Wang Lan.

868
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,080
I'm the executive director of Lu Group.

869
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,480
They all know my identity.

870
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm Lu Si Cheng and Lu Yue's mother.

871
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Mrs. Lu.

872
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,560
Mr. Wang, you go first.

873
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
I'll go out first.

874
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Mr. Wang, listen to me.

875
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,760
Actually, it's not really Tong Yao's fault.

876
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,520
She came here to investigate.

877
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,000
And the competition is very close.

878
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,480
Cheng's injury is also recovered.

879
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,080
If she's injured because of the girls' return,

880
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,480
the competition will be worse.

881
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,080
Tong Yao is also concerned about Cheng.

882
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,480
So she...

883
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,480
People say that the middle of ZGDX is a big deal.

884
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,280
No.

885
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
No.

886
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,080
And people say that the middle of ZGDX is very arrogant.

887
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,480
Like a loser.

888
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,280
Mr. Wang.

889
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,480
I'm responsible for this.

890
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,280
She and Tong Yao...

891
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
Of course you're responsible.

892
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,480
The salary and bonus for two months.

893
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,480
Don't argue with me.

894
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,880
It's so terrible to have such an old mother.

895
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,680
As for Tong Yao,

896
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
how about this?

897
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,080
Why are you here?

898
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,280
Brother Cheng, I can go back to your place.

899
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,480
I don't need to go in now.

900
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,280
Brother Cheng.

901
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
Brother Cheng.

902
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,680
You finally came.

903
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Why did you come here with your dad?

904
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Why are you so rude?

905
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Don't you know how to teach your mom?

906
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,280
Such a big thing happened.

907
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
I have to deal with it.

908
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,280
It's simple.

909
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,680
I've thought about how to deal with it.

910
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,280
This is indeed Tong Yao's move.

911
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
So no matter what,

912
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,880
the bureau must express first.

913
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,280
The apology is clearly stated.

914
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
It's decided to be a test.

915
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
But the principle of the matter

916
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
can't be passed on by anyone.

917
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
So, Xiaorui.

918
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Go find some good platforms and media

919
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
that are usually in good cooperation.

920
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
Make it clear.

921
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
Yes. Yes.

922
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
I think Brother Cheng is right.

923
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Besides the media,

924
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
I'll find some other brothers.

925
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
CK, YQCB.

926
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
When they're on live,

927
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
help us to make a living.

928
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Then?

929
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Then...

930
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Then what?

931
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
Apologizing is not just apologizing.

932
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
When you hit someone,

933
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
the bureau will definitely have an explanation.

934
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Otherwise, it would be so unambitious.

935
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Then, Mr. Wang.

936
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
What... what are you going to do?

937
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Tong Yao is on the competition.

938
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Competition?

939
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
This...

940
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Don't you want to

941
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
put this matter

942
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
in the control room of the competition?

943
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
I'll do it.

944
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Okay.

945
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
