1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
There's

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,320
so many romantic strangles and

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,720
olutions.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,080
The beating of the

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,600
wolf is so Karen's.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,760
I think you're right.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,640
Why do you promise

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,440
to do it?

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,120
This is really

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,200
a tragedy,

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,720
啊!

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,280
The deaf throne is

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
as sloppy as真的.

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,640
The shears,

15
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,960
has a girlіs' and a girl's dance.

16
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,960
I'll discuss with the company

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,960
to delete all the cards in the negative side.

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Then everyone should pay attention.

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Recently, you've stopped using your second phone.

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Weibo, Jingqiao's Yangzhi Market, and Lunta.

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Don't read it.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
This is for everyone's good.

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Don't be too busy.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Put your attention on the competition.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Don't watch what you have.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Otherwise, it will affect the mentality of the competition.

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
It doesn't matter if you don't watch the phone.

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
If you can win the competition,

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
they will shut their mouths at the end.

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,960
The key is to use your hands, not your mouth.

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Do you understand?

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Yes.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
The defense is not on the line.

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
You should go to the other side first.

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Yes.

36
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
The score on the court is 1 to 0.

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
The winner of the first game of the game,

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
ZGDX, can you win the game

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
and get the victory of the game?

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
We can see that the two sides are fighting.

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,960
ZGDX is more stable in the last game.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Yes.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
How do you think about the game?

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
In the last game,

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Smiling was really good at the game.

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
The opponent was so good.

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
The reaction of four people

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
is already very good.

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
It's true that the female king Smiling

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
is famous for his strategy.

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Yes.

52
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Lie down.

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Give me a little turtle.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm coming.

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Turn around.

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Little turtle.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Nice.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
This way.

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Go.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Little turtle, follow me.

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm coming.

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
What am I saying?

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Today's game is indeed Smiling.

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
The last team face

65
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
not only protected the gentlemen,

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
but also got the head.

67
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
OK.

68
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Let's congratulate ZGDX

69
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
for winning the game.

70
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Thank you, ZGDX.

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
The perfect match today.

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
It brought us a wonderful game.

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Yes.

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,240
And the three great

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,960
players in the opening game

76
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
never disappointed us.

77
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
We also congratulate ZGDX

78
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
for winning the game.

79
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Congratulations.

80
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Let's go.

81
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Let's go.

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Congratulations to ZGDX

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,960
for winning the game.

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Congratulations to Smiling

85
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
for winning the game.

86
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Thank you.

87
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
How do you feel

88
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,960
when you return to the team?

89
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
It's good.

90
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Because there were many

91
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
rhythm games before.

92
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
It caused everyone

93
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
to be a little nervous.

94
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
I believe that

95
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
after this game,

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
there will be some problems.

97
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
We saw that

98
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
there were some adjustments

99
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
on the play of ZGDX.

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
The command is not just

101
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
one person.

102
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
What adjustment

103
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
is there in this aspect?

104
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Yes.

105
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
There are some adjustments.

106
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
And in the game,

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
everyone is very active.

108
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Do you need to change the command?

109
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Our father

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
is still our father.

111
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
If we want to change the command,

112
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
we can't just

113
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
go over the body.

114
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Recently,

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
on the Internet,

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
we have received a lot of questions

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
about the return of ZGDX's captain

118
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
and fans.

119
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Do you have anything

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
to say to your teammates and fans?

121
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Two MVP matches.

122
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
You guys just want to ask this.

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Smiling, come on!

124
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
We will always be strong!

125
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
You are the best!

126
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Come on, Smiling!

127
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
We will always be strong!

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
We will always be strong!

129
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Come on, you are the best!

130
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Smiling, come on!

131
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
I don't know

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
what kind of identity

133
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
I should use

134
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
to answer this question

135
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
today.

136
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
I played half a season of the game

137
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
and became a teammate of half a season.

138
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
I think

139
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
I should know

140
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
what ZGDX, Lu Si Cheng,

141
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
and what he wants.

142
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
I believe

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
everyone in the arena

144
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
should know that.

145
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
One day,

146
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
I can stand on the stage

147
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
with my five-star red flag,

148
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
and raise our

149
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
pride.

150
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Before that,

151
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
I can be a good person.

152
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I can kill him.

153
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
As the captain of GDX,

154
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
everyone has to

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
look forward to it.

156
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
He should take it.

157
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
He is willing to take it.

158
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
He must take it.

159
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Please, some fans,

160
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
we can understand

161
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
your feelings for Lu Si Cheng.

162
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
But the electronic system

163
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
is not successful.

164
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
There is nothing.

165
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
The player you raised

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
is the one who

167
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
stood on the stage

168
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
and wanted to play.

169
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
It's just because

170
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
he is a little tall

171
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
and handsome.

172
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
We have to know that.

173
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
I know

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
the female in the electronic circle

175
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
is not very friendly on the Internet.

176
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Many girls are trying to change this role.

177
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
But I want to ask you

178
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
when we are trying to play a game,

179
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
watching the game,

180
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
and analyzing the game,

181
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
what are you doing?

182
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Okay, that's all.

183
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
I will be scolded

184
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
if I say too much.

185
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
But if I get offended

186
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
in the above,

187
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I won't regret it.

188
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Thank you.

189
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Thank you.

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
He is so sweet.

191
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
I think he is right.

192
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Why are you here?

193
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
You scared me.

194
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
Why are you here?

195
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
It's all right.

196
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Don't say that

197
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
without the word.

198
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
You are afraid of it.

199
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
I just saw you on stage.

200
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
It's all because of the same number of people.

201
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Stop it.

202
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
I did it for who?

203
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Actually, after I said

204
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
those words on the stage,

205
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I was very afraid of loving you.

206
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Why?

207
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Because after I said

208
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
the hook-up incident last time,

209
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
I promised you

210
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
that I will do my best.

211
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I won't be a person now.

212
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
You are quite good at learning.

213
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Yes.

214
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
But

215
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
I will forgive you this time.

216
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
It's easy to be born in the electric circle.

217
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Then, Miss Xiao is so cute.

218
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
I like it.

219
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Miss Xiao, come on.

220
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
I will be a little bit more mature.

221
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Miss Xiao, come on.

222
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Guang,

223
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
there are a lot of questions about Smiling

224
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
on the Internet these days.

225
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
What do you think about it?

226
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Smiling is a good person.

227
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Those who say she is

228
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
will never know

229
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
and don't want to know her well.

230
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Smiling is a very good professional player.

231
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Pay attention.

232
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I am talking about professional players.

233
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Who is talking about Smiling

234
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
and Sister Huaihua?

235
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
What can I say?

236
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
What can I say?

237
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I advise you

238
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
not to be a little bit more mature

239
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
and take the responsibility of being a gentleman.

240
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Don't be in my live stream either.

241
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Or in any of our team's live streams,

242
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
you can use Smiling's rhythm.

243
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Those who know how to play

244
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
will not talk about it.

245
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
It's embarrassing.

246
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
My room

247
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
doesn't have Sister Smiling Huaihua.

248
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
It's not interesting.

249
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
It will be crazy.

250
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
No way.

251
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
It's forbidden.

252
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
I help her talk

253
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
to a relationship that is not half-percent.

254
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
It has nothing to do with her.

255
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
It's okay.

256
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
First, you should take care of yourself

257
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
and then you should worry about others.

258
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
You are against her.

259
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
You should not pay attention to me.

260
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
She has her own achievements today.

261
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
She is a hard worker.

262
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
You can not like her.

263
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
But most of our team

264
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
have such a rival.

265
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
I don't like to ask you to respect me.

266
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Respect her IG

267
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
will make this dream come true.

268
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
It's none of her business.

269
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
One day,

270
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
she can stand on the peak of that stage

271
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,960
and invite her to the grand prize of Meng Mei Yi Qiu.

272
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Before that,

273
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
she is good at being competitive.

274
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
She is a good player.

275
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
As the captain of ZGDX,

276
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
she has all the hopes and faith

277
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
and she is willing to win.

278
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
She should win.

279
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
She must win.

280
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
She is so good.

281
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
She is very brave.

282
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I am very impressed.

283
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Don't worry.

284
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
She is standing on the top of the national championship.

285
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Unfortunately, she is not ZGDX.

286
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
But I will

287
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
win the grand prize of the champion.

288
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
No one will be able to make it.

289
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
If you have time to work here,

290
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
you should spend some time to improve yourself.

291
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Tian Zimeng,

292
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,960
my wife is good at drawing.

293
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Rehab?

294
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I saw it.

295
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
She is very charming.

296
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
That's why I said

297
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,960
who is Lu Si Chen?

298
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
What do you mean?

299
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
The main character is Qin Er.

300
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Yes.

301
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
That's the saying.

302
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,960
The main character is this.

303
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Fuer,

304
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
let me tell you.

305
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
It's a pity that

306
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
our ZGDX team is very close to each other.

307
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Don't worry.

308
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Miss Tong Yao said

309
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
that the title of the champion is

310
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
the same as the title of the champion.

311
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
I think

312
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
it's not related to

313
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
the title of the champion.

314
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
It won't affect us.

315
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
It's better for the fans

316
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
or the black face.

317
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
We will give you

318
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
a satisfactory answer

319
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
in the national competition.

320
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Yes.

321
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Come on.

322
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
As we said,

323
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
the suffering of the champion

324
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
will be the light of the road ahead.

325
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
ZGDX, come on.

326
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Come on.

327
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Let's make a toast

328
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
to the champion of the champion.

329
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Come on.

330
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Come on.

331
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Let's take a photo of the whole family.

332
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Come on.

333
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Come on.

334
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,960
ZGDX, come on.

335
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Come on.

336
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Cheers.

337
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Come on, Lao K.

338
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Come on.

339
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Let's have a big chat.

340
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Who is it?

341
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Come on.

342
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
I don't care.

343
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I don't care.

344
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Recently,

345
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
my friend said

346
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
that I have a bad relationship

347
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
with Lao K and my brother.

348
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Come on.

349
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Xuan Li, let's take a photo.

350
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Take a photo.

351
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Hello, your delivery.

352
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Please sign it.

353
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Okay.

354
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Thank you.

355
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Thank you.

356
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Come on.

357
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Let me take you.

358
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Okay.

359
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
What's going on?

360
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Go back.

361
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
No, wait a minute.

362
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Okay.

363
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Come on.

364
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
This is so disgusting.

365
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
You are actually a wolf.

366
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
You are a pervert.

367
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
With such a low-key means,

368
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
you can't even get a chance to play.

369
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
You're so dangerous.

370
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Look.

371
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Here's a letter.

372
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
What did you write?

373
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Who wrote it?

374
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
I'll give you a little lesson

375
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
that's so arrogant.

376
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
You should leave the competition.

377
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
The audiences are very far away.

378
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
The audience is very far away.

379
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
I'll take it away.

380
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
It's so embarrassing.

381
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I'll take a photo first.

382
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Yes, it's all the evidence.

383
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
And this.

384
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Take a photo too.

385
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Hello, comrade Jiang Shao.

386
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I'll call the police.

387
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
This guy is crazy.

388
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
What's the point of being so ugly?

389
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
He's so cruel.

390
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
Can't you do this?

391
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
It's okay.

392
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I'll hold it.

393
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Okay.

394
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
There's a stamp in the box.

395
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
The stamp is more suitable for the old man.

396
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
They're all stamps.

397
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
I must have said it in the live broadcast.

398
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I'm afraid of stamps.

399
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Why didn't I say

400
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
I have a gold peacock stamp?

401
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
You shed tears.

402
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
You said so much.

403
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
But it hurts.

404
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
You're going to put the whole bottle

405
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
on my hand.

406
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Do you know how painful it is?

407
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
It's not painful.

408
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
It's not painful.

409
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Are you okay?

410
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm fine.

411
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I think so.

412
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Let's go.

413
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Let's go.

414
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Have a rest.

415
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Brother Cheng.

416
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
What's wrong?

417
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
There's a seal and a letter

418
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
in the box.

419
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
They said they're going to do something

420
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
during the day.

421
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
I'm afraid they'll do something

422
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
after the day.

423
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
I've called the police.

424
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I've also contacted the

425
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
head of the competition.

426
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
They'll make sure

427
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
they can get a close-up.

428
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
But it might be useless.

429
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
So?

430
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
What we mean is

431
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Tong Yao's hand is injured.

432
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
To be safe,

433
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
she shouldn't go to the scene

434
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
if she doesn't listen to the red arrow.

435
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
It's good that Lu Yue can practice.

436
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
The boss is training

437
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
and doesn't play the game.

438
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm afraid

439
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
she won't be able to do it

440
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
when she's in the scene.

441
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
No.

442
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
She can't be hurt.

443
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Safety first.

444
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Although the injury

445
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
isn't that serious,

446
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
she's injured after all.

447
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

448
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

449
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

450
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

451
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

452
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

453
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

454
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

455
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

456
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

457
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

458
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

459
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

460
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

461
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

462
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

463
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

464
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

465
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

466
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

467
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

468
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
I'm afraid she'll do something.

469
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Presidenthao.

470
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,460
With formal and persuasive operation.

471
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Group Hotel.

472
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Group Hotel.

473
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,980
They like to Lake opera

474
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,960
with her evening work.

475
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,960
And it's a Grade 6 cast.

476
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,960
The copy from Old Cat

477
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,460
has been merged for research.

478
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,460
Next, we shall talk about new accents.

479
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Ok.

480
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Let me tell you.

481
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Because of the fast-release event,

482
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
the club has sent a notice.

483
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
The competition is held on the weekend.

484
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
In order to be safe,

485
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Tong Yao will temporarily stop the competition and start the show.

486
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Tong Yao, you agreed?

487
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
I think it's fine.

488
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,960
It's just that I want to practice the new spirit of the club.

489
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Maybe I can use it in the future.

490
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
And the club also comes with a safety plan.

491
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
We don't have to be so anxious to be safe.

492
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
We don't have to be so anxious to be safe.

493
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
And I've discussed this with Brother Rui.

494
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,960
It's not announced for the time being.

495
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Some people want to study medicine.

496
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
But I'm the only one who's unlucky.

497
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
And I don't want my fans to worry about me.

498
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,960
It's a big problem for me.

499
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
What's wrong with Brother Cheng?

500
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
What's going on?

501
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
He's angry.

502
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Are you okay?

503
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
This is a very urgent matter.

504
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
But there's nothing I can do.

505
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
I understand the management.

506
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Don't blame them.

507
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
You're a little girl.

508
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
You're a little girl.

509
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
You're a little girl.

510
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
You're a little girl.

511
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
You're a little girl.

512
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
If anything really happened,

513
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
we wouldn't have the face to tell your family.

514
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Don't worry.

515
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I'm fine.

516
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Where did she go?

517
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
She's back.

518
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm sorry.

519
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm sorry.

520
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
I'm sorry.

521
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm sorry.

522
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
I'm sorry.

523
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I'm sorry.

524
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
I'm sorry.

525
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm sorry.

526
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
I'm sorry.

527
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
I'm sorry.

528
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm sorry.

529
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I'm sorry.

530
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm sorry.

531
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
I'm sorry.

532
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm sorry.

533
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm sorry.

534
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
I'm sorry.

535
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
I'm sorry.

536
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm sorry.

537
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
I'm sorry.

538
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
I'm sorry.

539
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
I'm sorry.

540
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
I'm sorry.

541
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm sorry.

542
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
I'm sorry.

543
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm sorry.

544
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm sorry.

545
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
I'm sorry.

546
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
I'm fine.

547
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
I just want to rest for a game.

548
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Not a game.

549
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I don't feel any pain.

550
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Although I'm a professional player,

551
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
the only job is to play games.

552
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,960
But fans are not allowed to sell their products.

553
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Sometimes you'll think it's too harsh.

554
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Why don't they disappear?

555
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
But sometimes,

556
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
if it's a low-key period,

557
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,960
it's not like we can't see them

558
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
and support us.

559
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
This world is not really black and white.

560
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
For example,

561
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
when I was doing an MVP interview,

562
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,960
I was brave enough to say those words

563
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,960
because of fans' support.

564
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
I don't regret it now.

565
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Forget it.

566
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
I don't know if I'm telling the truth.

567
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I did it.

568
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,960
Do it again.

569
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Tell me.

570
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,980
The

571
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Match Chur's age.

572
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
I'm asking my age.

Why are you so mad?

576
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,360

I just came back home this morning.

585
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,420
I didn't answer my phone for so long.

586
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,380
I thought you were dead.

587
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,620
I'm fine.

588
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,100
I just went to the cat room.

589
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I didn't see it.

590
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,820

He just started to push me.

683
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,380
He didn't even let me take a bite.

684
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,620
The enemy is gone.

685
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,340
Be careful, Lu Yue.

686
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,420
A white-tea has already made me feel so stressed.

687
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,900
You guys should come and catch him.

688
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,860
Let's scare them.

689
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,420
The captain is pushing the line.

690
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,780
We can't get through.

691
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,300
Okay.

692
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,820
Call the enemy.

693
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,300
Mengmeng, come here.

694
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:22,980
Wait for the mid lane.

695
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,020
Wait for the mid lane.

696
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,140
Lu Yue, go and sell it.

697
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,900
Don't be too deep.

698
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,500
Okay.

699
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,900
Why are there so many people today?

700
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,380
The enemy is already moving.

701
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,820
Mengmeng, what do you mean?

702
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
The enemy is coming.

703
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,140
The team of the bot lane is going to take the kill.

704
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,740
The bot lane is really amazing.

705
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,020
Lu Yue, be careful.

706
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,420
You're going to cheat the white-tea.

707
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,060
Okay.

708
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,100
Don't be too anxious.

709
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,780
Wait for the top lane.

710
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,380
The enemy is going to go for the kill.

711
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,940
They are going to eat the white-tea's tiger.

712
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,540
They can't get through.

713
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,540
They can't get through.

714
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,220
They can't get through.

715
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,020
They can't get through.

716
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,780
What's wrong?

717
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,060
White-tea is trying to kill the green team.

718
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,180
The team of the green team is going to kill the white-tea.

719
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,260
They are trying to kill the red team.

720
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,820
They can't get through.

721
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,180
Get up.

722
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,140
Get up.

723
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,980
They are being chased by the ZGDX.

724
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,660
They are trying to kill the red team.

725
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
They are trying to kill the green team.

726
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,260
Get up.

727
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,660
This is so cool.

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,060
You guys are so awesome.

729
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,900
The game has been played for 30 minutes.

730
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,940
The ZGDX is getting more and more aggressive.

731
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
Let's watch this game.

732
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,660
The enemy is going to take the kill.

733
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,780
They are going to support the bot lane.

734
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,300
You guys hide.

735
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,060
I'll go over from the jungle.

736
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,180
Lu Yue is going to defend the bot lane.

737
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,700
They are going to support the team.

738
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,500
I'm He Xi.

739
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,580
You guys have to protect me.

Go up.

743
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,940
I'm going up.

752
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,260
Do we still have a chance?

00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,240
Over there.

754
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,380

Hey, that's it.

756
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,380

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,480
They will be走?

758
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,780
Why are they so scared of me?

759
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,380
There is the way out the wrong way.

760
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,580
They really don't deal damage.

761
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,180
No, it's a tie.

762
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,760
They are beaten.

763
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,580
It's a tie, what it means.

764
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,020
F complete.

765
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
All the matches are still open.

766
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,460
Spring SPower is awesome.

767
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,500
Spring SPower has an amazing pack.

768
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,260
Spring S Branch is so crazy.

769
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,860
It's the finish point in the final.

770
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,740
The雨 Hall is fond of An amadeus.

771
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,620
We'll be back, ladies.

772
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
I want to congratulate you!

773
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,140
Congrats on BGX!

774
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,660
Bravo!

775
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,420
Run, didn't you see him?

776
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,540
He's not easy to reach.

777
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,740
Run.

778
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,620
Unless we reach him today,

779
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,380
we'll belan for the next two hours.

780
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,980
You've got również purse.

781
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,660
You're so agenda-a coverless.

782
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,700
Now that you're here,

783
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,260
don't forget I can just tell you

784
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,140
to go to the club.

785
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,800
The club is about to

786
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,980
beat a hard guy out of work.

787
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,420
We'll see��kie

788
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,380
how it goes.

789
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,480
There are some bad news.

790
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,280
the silly questions of the host?

791
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,520
No way.

792
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,520
They're here.

793
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,560
I'm very sorry to inform you

794
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,080
that there's no MAP interview today.

795
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,000
ZGDX's captain,

796
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,800
Chaseman,

797
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,040
refused our invitation.

798
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,040
Thank you.

799
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Why did you choose me?

800
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,200
Can you explain to us?

801
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,360
Explain to us.

802
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,440
Here's the car.

803
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,680
encrypt the Purse Card.

804
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:53,740
enquanto

805
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,300
You're very emotional today.

806
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,100
Is that true?

807
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,500
Is that meaningful?

808
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,100
Everyone knows that Smiling didn't participate in the match today.

809
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,660
The official staff didn't give any explanation for this.

810
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,940
Why is that?

811
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,020
When you saw which team was changing the formation,

812
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,500
you posted a Weibo first.

813
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,940
The reason why the club didn't change the formation

814
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,820
is because of the Smiling who didn't show up last week

815
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,140
and got the punishment after the match?

816
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,900
No.

817
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,580
The match today is planned for the World Championship

818
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,540
in June.

819
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,700
And the Smiling players

820
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,660
did everything they could to make it.

821
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,620
Except for the fight,

822
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,540
they did everything well.

823
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,860
No matter if it's me or the club,

824
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,740
there's no reason to punish them.

825
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,860
Right. Explain it.

826
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,140
Right.

827
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,500
Are you guys enough?

828
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,940
No one came to the club to ask these questions.

829
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,180
Give it to me.

830
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,460
Everyone,

831
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,100
you're going to write a report. I don't have any idea.

832
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,620
But you should take a look at the title and content.

833
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,060
You should pay attention to it.

834
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,980
There are a few media

835
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,100
that are in the field of entertainment.

836
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,220
If I see

837
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,020
you guys making a fuss around the club,

838
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,980
I'll make a report.

839
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,060
Let's see if we can

840
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,740
make you guys proud.

841
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,780
Why are you saying that?

842
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,740
What's going on?

843
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,420
Why are they like this?

844
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,380
What's going on?

845
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,660
Cheng, you're back.

846
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,380
Cheng.

847
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,460
Cheng,

848
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,100
I'm watching the match.

849
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,660
Why are you so fierce?

850
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,460
Do you feel uncomfortable?

851
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,860
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

852
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,700
Does your head hurt?

853
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,460
Does your stomach hurt?

854
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,620
Or do you have a cold?

855
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,300
No.

856
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,180
Why don't you accept the interview of the third-party MEP?

857
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,540
Or

858
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,740
do you see the online comments?

859
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,580
What do you mean?

860
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,820
You said

861
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,940
you're not satisfied with the punishment

862
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,820
that the club has given me.

863
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,220
So you're wearing emotions.

864
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,820
You don't accept the interview of the third-party MEP.

865
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,060
You're against it.

866
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,540
Of course, I know it's not like that.

867
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:40,900
Why are you...

868
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,140
I'm not a club.

869
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,900
But I'm not against the club.

870
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
Please eat.

871
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,460
Don't wait for me.

872
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,660
Sorry, I'm on a ride.

873
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,820
I brought you something.

874
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,700
What's wrong?

875
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,860
What's wrong?

876
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
Are you unhappy?

877
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,460
Tell me.

878
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,340
Brother Cheng is very strange recently.

879
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,420
As his girlfriend,

880
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,300
you're really more famous in this observation.

881
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,580
The reporter of the MEP

882
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,340
has already said so.

883
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,100
He's a girl.

884
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,300
Ever since he went out last time,

885
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,140
he's been so quiet and quiet

886
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,500
that he's still

887
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,900
not interested in what he said.

888
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,940
He doesn't care.

889
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,660
He's more like a painter to me.

890
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,140
Even if he keeps me in his arms,

891
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,780
he's like a lost soul.

892
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,660
Let me ask him.

893
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,340
He doesn't say anything.

894
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,260
He's crazy.

895
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,300
These days,

896
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,620
I'm fine.

897
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,900
He's almost got my lips touched.

898
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,980
But he's not useful to him at all.

899
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,220
I'm starting to suspect

900
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,380
he's not satisfied with me.

901
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,780
Chen Mo, the report, the drama,

902
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,780
and the show.

903
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,900
I have no idea.

904
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,660
He said this morning

905
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,460
he's not satisfied.

906
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,860
But he's not a club member.

907
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,140
Is he a team member?

908
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,540
He's a bit difficult to be a member.

909
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,900
I've never done this before.

910
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,900
I'm just focused on playing the game.

911
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,380
You're right.

912
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,900
It seems that you're different

913
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,460
after you came here.

914
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,580
You think it's because of me?

915
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,900
What are you talking about?

916
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,100
You're busy with your business again, right?

917
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,460
You saw Jian Yang

918
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,900
breaking up with his own

919
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,740
bomb in the KTV show

920
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,340
and now you're here again?

921
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,580
I don't know how funny you were.

922
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,620
At least,

923
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,300
you have your first point.

924
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,460
What's the point of Chen?

925
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
You're not even close to him.

926
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,820
You're just a criminal.

927
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,820
I'm just a random uncle.

928
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,020
He's a good man

929
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,940
who plays the game.

930
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,340
He's like a firefly

931
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,500
that's been caught by me.

932
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,540
At least,

933
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,300
the brain powder is right.

934
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,500
Firefly?

935
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,740
I'm so jealous of these little bastards.

936
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,740
They even have a couple

937
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,980
who want to be their own side.

938
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,180
I think they're not satisfied.

939
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,100
They're just not satisfied with themselves.

940
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,180
They're hiding from you.

941
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,380
Men are sometimes

942
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,300
stronger than we think.

943
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,380
But their self-esteem

944
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,740
is weaker.

945
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,060
Maybe they're hiding

946
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,180
in a place you can't see

947
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,500
and stealing a wall.

948
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,380
They're not responsible

949
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,780
for your small wound.

950
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,460
What small wound?

951
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,100
It's obviously big, okay?

952
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,780
I even broke up with Shang Feng

953
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,260
just for this.

954
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,140
I'm a little heartless.

955
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,140
It's impossible to break up.

956
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,500
You can't beat me.

957
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,820
You can only think about it alone.

958
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,180
I'm so hard.

959
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,700
The whole world is pretty high.

960
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,100
Who told him to ignore me?

961
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,420
I was just a hand pain.

962
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,620
I didn't even care about it.

963
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,220
I don't know why I'm so hurt.

964
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,660
By the way,

965
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,980
there's one more thing.

966
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,540
He's been missing all day.

967
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,340
He doesn't reply to my messages.

968
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,780
But the next morning,

969
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,700
he quietly climbed onto my bed

970
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,020
and hugged me.

971
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,460
He was still peeing.

972
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,340
What's going on

973
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,260
when he suddenly took a break?

974
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,100
What did he take a break for?

975
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,580
He disappeared as soon as he wanted to.

976
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,340
He just appeared.

977
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,740
This behavior

978
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,300
is what I'm talking about.

979
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,020
They're back to normal.

980
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,220
I must have been talking too much

981
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,180
in the live broadcast room.

982
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,900
I'm afraid of the war.

983
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,700
Why didn't I say

984
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,340
I have a brick-and-mortar fear of war?

985
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,380
I've shed tears.

986
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,700
I'm still talking too much.

987
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,980
It hurts.

988
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,420
You're going to put the whole bottle

989
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,620
on my hand.

990
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,300
Do you know how much it hurts?

991
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,100
It hurts my heart.

992
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,500
I'm afraid of the war.

993
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,420
I'm afraid of the war.

994
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,500
I'm still talking too much.

995
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,900
Chen,

996
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,180
what do you like about Tong Yao?

997
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,700
To be honest,

998
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,820
Tong Yao

999
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,460
is just a normal girl.

1000
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,420
She's the type of girl

1001
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,180
who can pull out and

1002
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,020
take care of herself.

1003
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,580
Because she's strong.

1004
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,060
You are very cute.

1005
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,220
You're so Enterprise

1006
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,900
and cute.

1007
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,420
Useless.

1008
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,060
And?

1009
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,660
To be honest,

1010
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,180
I'm the type of girl.

1011
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,340
Why are you crying?

1012
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,760
Why do you need to cry?

1013
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,320
I just want to move on.

1014
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,020
Brother Yuan,

1015
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,940
I will leave you with the very last piece of wood.

1016
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,340
It'll go with this.

1017
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,800
Finally,

1018
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,660
I can take my firework as well.

1019
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,260
I'm sorry.

1020
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,060
Please eat.

1021
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,060
Don't bring it back.

1022
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,660
Brother Cheng.

1023
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,460
Did I really do something wrong?

1024
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,460
Shouldn't we

1025
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,660
really be together?

1026
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,460
In my life

1027
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,860
I'm left with a message

1028
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,460
in your heart

1029
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,660
Now I know

1030
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,660
how long the future will last

1031
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,060
You are a hot love

1032
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,260
and you don't need to have it

1033
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,460
I want to get close to you

1034
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,860
A little bit close to you

1035
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,260
One moment, no expression

1036
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,660
Wei Zhuang, calm down

1037
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,060
The heart beat is always at home

1038
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
From the road to the salt rain

1039
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,260
the light is passing by

1040
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,260
The world is me and you

1041
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
The first touch

1042
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,660
You are like my breath

1043
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,260
I'm also standing there

1044
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
I want to get close to you

1045
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,260
A little bit close to you

1046
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,260
One moment, no expression

1047
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
Wei Zhuang, calm down

1048
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,060
The heart beat is always at home

1049
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,260
From the road to the salt rain

1050
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,260
the light is passing by

1051
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,260
The world is me and you

1052
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,260
One moment, no expression

1053
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,260
Wei Zhuang, calm down

1054
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,260
The heart beat is always at home

1055
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
From the road to the salt rain

1056
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
the light is passing by

1057
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,260
The world is me and you

1058
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,260
One moment, no expression

1059
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,860
I like you

1060
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,860
Your hand is my proof
