1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,720
I don't know anything about Tamamonomae.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,630
I'm no fricking No. 1 Tamamonomae player in China.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,350
She won't be discouraged by this

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,460
and not dare to play again, will she?

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,990
Rui, I'm going out for a bit.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,830
It's already eleven o'clock.

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,210
Why hasn't Tong Yao come back yet?

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,940
That silly girl didn't go jump in the sea, did she?

9
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,830
Waiter, give me another iced tea!

10
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,590
That's no iced tea!

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,250
That's a Long Island Iced Tea.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,910
But I saw online

13
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,470
that the new recruit of yours, "Smiling,"

14
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,670
was completely destroyed by Tai.

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,890
I wasn't destroyed at all.

16
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,980
I'm very strong.

17
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,310
Am I going to be a substitute for the substitute now?

18
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,780
You can't keep me on the bench.

19
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,220
I only lost one match.

20
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,030
I don't want to be stuck watching the water cooler.

21
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,170
Alcohol might make you forget your sorrows temporarily,

22
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,400
but we won't.

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,570
Let them say whatever they want.

24
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,920
We just need to focus on doing our best.

26
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,330
You don't understand me at all.

27
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,650
You have no idea what I care about.

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,800
What I care about

29
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,850
has never been what people say online.

30
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,400
I just hate myself for letting my teammates down.

31
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,550
As her teammates,

32
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,790
we must try to understand her at times like this.

33
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,710
For me, Tamamonomae is…

34
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,030
A belief.

35
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,010
How about establishing a new belief

36
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,370
with the determination to win?

37
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,780
Sis Smiling,

38
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,430
it's time to face it.

Good morning, Rui.

Cheng, let me be in the starting lineup.

I don't want to look at that water cooler over there.

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,470
How about I sing you a song,

are you going to harm me

just to let your brother be in the starting lineup?

68
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,190
No way, I'm the No. 1 Tamamonomae player in China.

You can't do this to me.

Cheng, your little girlfriend is quite a handful.

71
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,260
Shut up.

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,330
Open her mouth.

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,280
Come on. Open your mouth.

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
Here. Take the medicine.

75

Where's my yogurt?

81
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,610
There were five or six cans left before I went to bed last night.

82
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,230
What?

83
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,990
What are you doing?

84
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,890
Reflecting on life.

85
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,260
Reflecting on life?

86
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
From which moment?

87
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,510
Let me guess.

88
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,510
From...

89
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,920
the second before you were born

90
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,770
or from about fifteen hours ago

91
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,250
when you had your first Long Island Iced Tea?

92
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm guessing it's the latter.

93
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,850
Because the content of the latter

94
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,650
is rich enough to keep you thinking for a long time.

95
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,150
Captain,

96
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,470
did I do a lot of inappropriate things last night?

97
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,570
Inappropriate?

98
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,960
Not at all. What do you mean by inappropriate?

99
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,140
Which one are you referring to?

100
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,990
Are you referring to

101
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,800
the fact when you saw my brother,

102
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,910
you got scared, thinking you saw my ghost?

103
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,100
Or the time when you were crying so hard,

104
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,490
saying you're so strong

105
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,410
that you can't be a substitute?

106
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,280
That being a substitute means losing the whole world?

107
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,540
And then you started singing "The Flying Bugs"?

108
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,180
Oh, right.

109
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,860
Let me give you a piece of advice.

110
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,830
You really shouldn't sing anymore in the future.

111
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,290
Because you really turned a children's song into a scary song.

112
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,660
You also forcefully gave your used tissues

113
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,340
to our teammates one by one,

114
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,210
saying they were farewell gifts.

115
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,860
You wouldn't take no for an answer.

116
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,940
If they didn't accept, you'd hug them and cry loudly.

117
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,730
In the end, you even licked your cat's fur

118
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,049
and then put its ear in your mouth.

119
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,120
Several people couldn't pull you away.

120
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,850
You even bit someone in the end.

121
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,870
To be honest,

122
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,059
I got up this early

123
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,200
to get a rabies shot.

124
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,370
So, have you taken your medicine?

125
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,780
What medicine?

126
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,050
Hangover medicine.

127
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,790
I left it at your door.

128
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,220
How else can you cure this madness without medicine?

129
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,350
Stop, stop.

130
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,970
I know I was wrong.

131
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,050
Who knew that drink had alcohol in it?

132
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,780
Why call it Long Island Iced Tea if it has alcohol?

133
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,990
Because there's no wife in Wife Cakes,

134
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,690
no squirrel in Squirrel Fish,

135
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,430
and no Lei Feng in Lei Feng Tower.

136
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,220
So, of course, Long Island Iced Tea isn't tea.

137
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,420
You country bumpkin.

138
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,180
Also,

139
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,940
what's the idea of coming down in your pajamas?

140
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,040
What are you trying to do with that mask on?

141
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,190
Are you trying to scare us to death so you can eliminate us all and silence us?

142
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,390
Can I keep the mask on?

143
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,830
Why are you wearing that?

144
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,010
I'm embarrassed.

145
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,100
Oh, so you know what embarrassment is?

146
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,530
When you made us guard your snotty tissues yesterday,

147
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,500
you didn't seem to think it was embarrassing.

148
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,640
I'm not listening. I'm not listening!

149
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,540
Go upstairs and change your clothes now.

150
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,940
They're about to wake up.

151
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,900
Hey, sis, what is it?

152
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,540
You're looking for me?

153
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,470
Sobered up, huh?

154
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,030
What exactly happened at the bar yesterday?

155
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,510
I blacked out.

156
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,140
Nothing else matters.

157
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,370
You just need to remember

158
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,460
it was Cheng

159
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,600
who carried you away

160
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,060
right in front of your ex-boyfriend.

161
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,450
Ex-boyfriend?

162
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,170
Jian Yang was there, too?

163
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,970
It's all because of that idiot Ai Jia.

164
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,770
He insisted on calling him over.

165
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,780
Honey,

166
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,220
who are you calling an idiot?

167
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,790
Who's there?

168
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,630
Something's up?

169
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,080
Yao, let's get back together.

170
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,590
Yao, have you returned to the training base?

171
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,390
Where are you?

172
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,970
Drinking will give you a headache in the morning.

173
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,170
Remember to drink plenty of warm water.

174
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,150
Take this for a moment.

175
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,800
I won't.

176
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,970
I said take it.

177
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,250
Just hold it, will you?

178
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,580
You look like a big moron.

179
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,770
Shut up, will you?

180
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,410
The supermarket was so crowded today.

181
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:26,850
I was nearly crushed to death.

182
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,110
I think it was alright.

183
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,010
-Hurry up.
-Not bad.

184
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,300
Look, all Pang bought are delicious snacks.

185
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
What kind of food?

186
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,220
Hey, sis,

187
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,620
you're up so early to duo queue with Cheng?

188
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,740
How's your record?

189
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,740
Hello, Pang.

190
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,060
Why is it you?

191
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,140
Lu Yue, why are you back?

192
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,860
I'm back.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,940
What's up?

194
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,760
What?

195
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,100
I'm just suspended,

196
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,050
not retired.

197
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,690
Why are you all so surprised?

198
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,670
Cheng,

199
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,130
where are Rui and God Ming?

200
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,460
Do they know about this?

201
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,970
We ran into each other last night.

202
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,810
I'll go find God Ming.

203
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,840
Smiling guru,

204
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,140
what new trick are you up to now?

205
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,650
Too ashamed to show her face, I guess.

206
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,420
Why are you still here?

207
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,580
Because the team needs me.

208
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,380
No, it doesn't.

209
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,170
They need me.

210
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,080
No, they don't.

211
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,880
-They do.
-No, they don't.

212
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,080
This is my spot.

213
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,810
Is it?

214
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,780
Then, will it respond to you

215
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,910
if you call its name?

216
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,770
Get up.

217
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,410
No.

218
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,230
Get up.

219
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,300
No.

220
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,490
Oh my god, Cat,

221
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,440
why are you licking my cat's ears?

222
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,630
You're both almost 24 years old.

223
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,850
Why are you still acting like a three-year-old?

224
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,440
She's the one who's more like a three-year-old,

225
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,900
telling such a stupid lie just to grab the chair.

226
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,170
You believed such a stupid lie.

227
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,650
Doesn't that make you even more stupid?

228
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,290
Anyway, this is my chair now.

229
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,970
You can say whatever you want.

230
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,370
Pancake,

231
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,340
when did I lick your ears?

232
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
What's going on?

233
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,570
Why are you bringing your chair to eat?

234
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,500
Afraid I'll steal it from you?

235
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,380
This chair belongs to the starting mid laner.

236
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,940
You're the worst mid laner in our team's history.

237
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,070
Still better than you as a substitute.

238
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,500
Not bad.

239
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,020
The food has improved while I was away.

240
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,940
Where are you going?

241
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,000
Aren't you eating?

242
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,140
We are.

243
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,010
I'll eat over there.

244
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,540
How long are you planning to act crazy?

245
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,820
When are you leaving?

246
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,730
When I'm too old to lift a mouse.

247
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,600
When he's too old to lift a mouse

248
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,060
and stops competing with me for the starting position.

249
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,690
Or maybe you should say that again

250
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,350
when you can finally beat Tai.

251
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,140
That's enough.

252
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,290
You've already lost all face.

253
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,100
Even wearing a mask won't save it.

254
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,770
Let's eat.

255
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,770
K, Pang,

256
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,850
why are you eating over there?

257
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,780
Are you fighting over chairs, too?

258
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,440
What's wrong?

259
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,490
I'm not eating here, either.

260
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,750
This place isn't suitable for me to stay.

261
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,420
No way.

262
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,710
I'm here to avenge ZGDX.

263
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,280
I knew there was a reason I couldn't sleep.

264
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,340
Some people not only took my position

265
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,780
but also messed up my account.

266
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,860
Scoundrel.

267
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,020
Cheng, aren't you going to do something about her cursing?

268
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,930
Weren't you sleeping?

269
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,020
Why are you back down here?

270
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,500
There are always villains trying to usurp my throne.

271
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,030
How can I sleep peacefully?

272
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,360
Look who this is.

273
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,460
Tai?

274
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,870
Why don't you take over?

275
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,670
Does he know who's playing?

276
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,870
He's already picked Tamamonomae.

277
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,970
Why did you still choose Higanbana?

278
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,540
It's me this time.

279
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,580
What's there to panic about?

280
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,880
Do you really think

281
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,090
he can be that arrogant again this time?

282
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,650
You and your brother are cut from the same cloth,

283
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,810
arrogant and proud.

284
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,730
Watch your words.

285
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,330
Anyway, whether you win or lose this game,

286
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,940
I'll always be a loser

287
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,460
in Tai's eyes.

288
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,640
That image must be deeply rooted.

289
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,860
Sooner or later,

290
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,220
he'll be defeated.

291
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,050
Why care so much about what he thinks?

292
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,450
You've got too much time?

293
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,460
Keep attacking.

294
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,430
Why are you chickening out?

295
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,619
What's the point of attacking?

296
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,060
It won't kill him, and instead, I'll lose troops.

297
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,319
Are you stupid or what?

298
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,300
Trying to run?

299
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,450
Where do you think you're going?

300
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,670
Not bad. Well done.

301
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,300
You're pretty good.

302
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,010
Stop hitting. Stop hitting.

303
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,690
Cheng, can you control her?

304
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,750
I lost some troops.

305
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,240
He's tricking me again.

306
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,980
This Tai isn't very smart, either.

307
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,180
Trying to use the same trick on me twice?

308
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,610
No.

309
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,470
It's me who's not very smart.

310
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,780
Right.

311
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,300
He can only trick you.

312
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,850
He actually came here to feed me kills.

313
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,040
It's obvious he has help.

314
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,880
Trying to trick me?

315
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,940
No way, friend.

316
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,610
I have teammates, too.

317
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,090
How could you feed him a kill?

318
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,870
But honestly,

319
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,270
if it were me in that last wave,

320
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,300
I would have gone in.

321
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,180
I'm a coward.

322
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,880
Being a coward makes you safe.

323
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,170
Yes!

324
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,460
Not bad.

325
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,090
Not bad.

326
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,270
I have to admit,

327
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,910
you do have some skills.

328
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,740
Do you know what it means to come prepared?

329
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,730
I've studied all of Tai's match videos

330
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,970
beforehand.

331
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,940
I used to be a substitute for God Ming.

332
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,450
Whenever they needed a defensive mid laner,

333
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,580
they would put me in.

334
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,900
So, last season's results

335
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,830
were very good.

336
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,670
What's the use of that?

337
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,300
What's the point of having good results in the qualifying season?

338
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,770
We still didn't make it to the finals

339
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,020
because of someone.

340
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,710
In the end, we handed the trophy over to others.

341
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,490
Think about it.

342
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,310
God Ming's hand injury was so severe.

343
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,370
Who was really responsible for that?

344
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,380
I don't know what you guys are thinking.

345
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,930
I still stand by my opinion.

346
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,570
If this person is going to be a substitute,

347
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,210
fine.

348
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,980
That's the club's prerogative.

349
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,250
But personally,

350
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,510
I won't accept such a teammate.

351
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,070
You guys continue. I'll go check.

352
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,810
It's been so long since this happened.

353
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,280
Why bring it up again?

354
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,660
God Ming himself hasn't said anything about it, right?

355
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,590
You think that everyone is like you

356
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,440
and that not talking about it makes it go away?

357
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,300
Why are you being so harsh with me?

358
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,360
He's right.

359
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,360
It's my fault.

360
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,960
Let's continue playing.

361
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,020
Do you know what it means to come prepared?

362
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,150
I've studied all of Tai's match videos

363
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,220
beforehand.

364
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,860
I used to be a substitute for God Ming.

365
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,380
Whenever they needed a defensive mid laner,

366
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,510
they would put me in.

367
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,400
Sis, I lost to a substitute.

368
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,380
I saw him play mid lane today, and he was pretty good.

369
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,460
He's more stable than me.

370
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,410
What should I do?

371
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,950
I feel like my starting position is in jeopardy.

372
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,730
I'm feeling insecure and unhappy.

373
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,060
I'm getting emotional.

374
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,370
I'm being oversensitive again.

375
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,690
We still didn't make it to the finals

376
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,890
because of someone.

377
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,530
In the end, we handed the trophy over to others.

[ZGDX withdraws]

379
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,890
Team ZGDX won this year's

380
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,700
Onmyoji Arena Spring Championship.

381
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,820
And in the National League,

382
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,060
they fought their way through,

383
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,930
dominating every match.

384
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,990
Just when everyone thought Team ZGDX

385
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,420
was in closed training

386
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,420
to prepare for the National Finals

387
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,500
of OPL,

388
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,980
ZGDX officials announced shocking news.

389
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,190
Team ZGDX

390
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,900
decided to withdraw from the National Finals

391
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,930
of OPL.

392
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,260
The internet was filled with criticism at the time.

393
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,660
Some said ZGDX had lost its funding

394
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,450
and was facing dissolution.

395
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,730
Some said there were internal issues among the members

396
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,940
and they couldn't compete at all.

397
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,170
Some even said they just couldn't handle the pressure

398
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:28,900
and chickened out.

399
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,700
There were many theories,

400
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,140
but in the end, no one got a definitive answer.

401
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,300
In last year's finals,

402
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,780
Team ZGDX wasn't on the roster.

403
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,280
Think about it.

404
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,140
God Ming's hand injury was so severe.

405
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,040
Who was really responsible for that?

406
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,840
Could it be that these so-called "certain things"

407
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,550
are related to Lu Yue?

408
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,390
And even God Ming is involved?

409
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,890
Isn't anyone going to discuss Smiling?

410
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,420
Did she just get revenge on Tai?

411
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,810
The Korean server's general channel is blowing up.

412
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,670
Could it be that Lv played for her?

413
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,030
Lu Yue caused so much harm to God Ming.

414
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,690
Just don't come back

415
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,710
to ruin the Chinese esports industry, okay?

416
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,460
When it comes to the team's starting position,

417
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,060
I still support Sis Smiling.

418
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,260
Wait, something's not right.

419
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,390
How do the netizens know Lu Yue is back?

420
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,070
I wonder what God Ming and Rui were thinking.

421
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,710
I'm really not trying to stir up trouble,

422
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,920
but you saw his attitude today,

423
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,960
didn't you?

424
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,850
We can't just let go of this matter.

425
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,780
Someone has to speak up about certain things, right?

426
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,930
I thought since so much time had passed,

427
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,190
he might have changed.

428
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,340
But I never expected

429
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
he'd be so nonchalant about it,

430
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,700
acting like nothing ever happened

431
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,020
and just come back like this.

432
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,150
He even has the nerve to say he was God Ming's substitute.

433
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,290
Look,

434
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,050
he's even brazenly announcing it to the whole world

435
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,710
as if he's done nothing wrong.

436
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,840
Maybe he thinks that after a year,

437
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,370
everything has blown over.

438
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,850
But God Ming's hand...

439
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,380
Why aren't you guys sleeping in the middle of the night?

440
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,520
Are you playing ghosts here?

441
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,980
Why aren't you asleep yet?

442
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,250
I can't sleep.

443
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,340
What? Did you eat too much?

444
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,580
It's because of Lu Yue, isn't it?

445
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,340
You all saw today's match.

446
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,670
Lu Yue's performance was indeed more stable than mine.

447
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,860
Perhaps if he were the starting mid laner,

448
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,320
it would be more suitable.

449
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,860
Don't worry.

450
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,410
Lu Yue will definitely not become the starter.

She's quite cunning behind the scenes.

471

Maybe she's afraid of Lu Yue

taking her starting position in the national competition,

00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,970
we can't just ignore it and hope it goes away.

507
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,100
We need to quickly think of a solution.

508
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,210
Lu Yue, you'd better not look at it.

509
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,890
There are hardly any kind words.

510
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,820
Don't look at it.

511
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,230
Rui, I'll handle the official blog issue.

512
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,820
Hello?

513
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,860
Regret it now?

514
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,740
I told you back then

515
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,140
that professional players are also semi-public figures.

516
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,170
Your behavior can't be the same as when you were in school.

517
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,580
Keep a low profile in everything.

518
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,380
Don't harm others and yourself.

519
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,450
First of all,

520
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,660
this incident is definitely aimed at Lu Yue.

521
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,780
He just returned to the club after his suspension ended,

522
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,580
and someone released the video.

523
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,740
It's obvious.

524
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,810
They want to use public opinion to prevent his return.

525
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,410
This video

526
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,640
is only available to our internal staff.

527
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,420
To be honest,

528
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,130
at that time, why the news

529
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,930
was kept so tightly under wraps?

530
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,370
Because those who have seen this video

531
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,770
and those who have had access to it,

532
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,880
including the karaoke room staff and the police,

533
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,340
were absolutely no more than twenty people.

534
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,810
The karaoke room security and the police

535
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,760
are all middle-aged people in their thirties and forties.

536
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,790
In their view,

537
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,380
this incident had nothing to do with esports.

538
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,840
It was just a group of young people fighting.

539
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,410
The remaining people

540
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,080
are only from our club and Team JK.

541
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,290
The people from Team JK

542
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,020
certainly wouldn't dare to release this video.

543
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
Because in terms of suppressing public opinion,

544
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,130
releasing this video

545
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,660
would do them no good at all.

546
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,630
The decision to suppress this matter at that time

547
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,890
was also a result of everyone's discussion.

548
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,670
They even seemed more eager than us.

549
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,470
Why?

550
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,540
Wasn't Lu Yue the one who started it?

551
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,740
But they fought back.

552
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,540
Self-defense.

553
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
That's not how self-defense works.

554
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,900
At that time, those people were trying to subdue Lu Yue.

555
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,820
They pinned him to the ground

556
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,160
and tried to take the weapon from his hand.

557
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,820
That's called self-defense.

558
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,460
Later, they beat him up again.

559
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,010
This is called group fighting.

560
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,060
But in my opinion,

561
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,170
he had it coming.

562
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,880
Alright, alright.

563
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,950
Anyway, this matter

564
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,850
was definitely done by one of our own.

565
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
I don't know who it was

566
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,400
but on behalf of the club,

567
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,860
I hope you can step forward

568
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,550
and resolve this issue properly.

569
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,140
There are a lot of rumors going around now.

570
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,980
Everyone is in the spotlight.

571
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,940
If we're not united internally at this time,

572
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,200
something really bad is going to happen.

573
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,780
I posted the video.

574
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,180
Pang?

575
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,060
I'm sorry, Tong Yao.

576
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,840
I didn't mean to implicate you.

577
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,160
This was only aimed at Lu Yue.

578
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,670
I'll say it again,

579
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,740
if he wants to be a substitute,

580
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,130
fine.

581
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,450
That's the club's prerogative.

582
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,500
But personally,

583
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,580
I don't accept such a teammate.

584
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,820
Pang, stop talking.

585
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,690
If someone like him rejoins the team,

586
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,350
you all might agree,

587
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,150
but I can't.

588
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,370
I don't accept it, either.

589
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,010
What are you saying?

590
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,560
He's the main reason why God Ming retired.

591
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,620
He must give all of us an explanation.

592
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,850
He's not the reason why I retired.

593
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,090
God Ming,

594
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,460
by protecting him like this,

595
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,270
do you think you can cover up all his mistakes?

596
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Why fight?

597
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,290
Why drag God Ming Shen?

598
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,080
Why implicate the whole team?

599
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,180
You think it's cool to hit someone with a bottle, huh?

600
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,820
When I was in school,

601
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,730
I was hot-blooded, too, and often got into fights.

602
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,460
But I stopped doing that later.

603
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,340
Why?

604
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,540
Because I know I'm a professional player.

605
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,800
Fighting

606
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,580
not only brings punishment and criticism to me,

607
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,300
but also affects my teammates, the club,

608
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,430
and even the entire esports industry.

609
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,460
On a small scale,

610
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,180
because of your one action,

611
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,570
God Ming's entire career

612
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,780
was ruined just like that.

613
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,090
We also couldn't go to the national finals

614
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,450
because of this mess.

615
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,390
A whole year's effort of the entire team was wasted.

616
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,580
On a larger scale,

617
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,100
do you know what people outside

618
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,900
say about the esports industry?

619
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,820
They say we're internet-addicted youth,

620
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,530
good-for-nothing,

621
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,260
and that playing games won't lead to any success.

622
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,280
I hear this kind of talk every year.

623
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,950
Even though I'm tired of hearing it, I still can't hold my head high.

624
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,660
Because no matter how hard I try

625
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,640
to explain to others

626
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,650
that we esports players are not like that,

627
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,900
that we're not just hooligans who only know how to play games,

628
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,100
but then, I'll always

629
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,690
find teammates like you dragging us down.

630
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,930
You prove to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of people through your actions

631
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,180
that they are right,

632
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,100
that we are exactly as they described—

633
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,420
a bunch of losers.

634
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,580
Oh my god.

635
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,700
The video was posted by Pang.

636
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,460
Pang! That Pang!

637
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,660
Honey.

638
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,130
I made you a delicious breakfast with love.

639
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,020
Here, have a cup of soy milk.

640
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,110
Pang got into an argument with Lu Yue.

641
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,820
What should we do?

642
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,850
It feels so awkward.

643
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,290
Who am I? Where am I? What am I supposed to do?

644
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,120
Did Pang really post that video?

645
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,740
We're all from the same roots. Why the rush to torment each other?

646
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,030
Honey.

647
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,090
You're talking about that fight video online, right?

648
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,170
I was there when it happened.

649
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,220
Who are you calling "honey"?

650
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,340
Watch how you speak.

651
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,570
You're still on probation.

652
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,430
Don't make me deduct your points.

653
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,140
Ai Jia, are you crazy?

654
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,620
How dare you touch my lipstick!

655
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,030
Honey, don't be angry.

656
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,840
Let me show you something.

657
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,340
Look.

658
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,470
Love heart light waves, Biu Biu Biu!

659
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,090
Biu my foot!

660
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,010
I fought so hard to get

661
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,610
this heart-shaped lipstick!

662
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,430
Don't make me deduct your points.

663
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,630
Don't deduct points.

664
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,890
How about this?

665
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,700
Do you want to know the truth about what happened?

666
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,680
You know the truth?

667
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,730
Of course I do.

668
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,590
The truth is often not what it appears on the surface.

669
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,130
Do you want to hear it?

670
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,410
If you're going to say it, say it.

671
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,370
If not, get lost.

672
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,860
Just wait.

673
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,210
After causing such a big mess

674
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,010
and bringing us so much trouble,

675
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,490
and just by simply spending a year fooling around outside,

676
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,060
he can act like nothing happened

677
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,050
and take no responsibility?

678
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:30,820
On what grounds?

679
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,300
Pang, you've got it wrong.

680
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,170
Lu Yue didn't fight with others for no reason.

681
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,500
It was because what they said

682
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,610
was really offensive.

683
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,940
That's why he resorted to violence.

684
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,540
In this situation, any one of us would have…

685
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,610
I wouldn't.

686
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,160
It's clearly Lu Yue who made a mistake.

687
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,890
Why do you keep protecting him?

688
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,980
No need to say more.

689
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,500
I was impulsive.

690
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,780
I am a scumbag who dragged down my teammates.

691
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,100
But how is your action of posting that video

692
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,900
any different from my fighting?

693
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,980
Didn't it also affect our teammates?

694
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,130
The difference between you and me is

695
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,380
that I have a sense of shame.

696
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,450
When I make a mistake, I take responsibility.

697
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,060
As for you,

698
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,050
you're just a coward who always runs away.

699
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,660
Say that again!

700
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,480
What if I say it again?

701
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,660
-You're a coward!
-Shut up.

702
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,860
-You coward!
-Say it again!

703
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,690
-Sit down.
-You coward!

704
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,180
You're just a coward!

705
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,910
Alright, Pang, that's enough.

706
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,820
Sit down. Sit down.

707
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,580
Come on, let's go outside and cool off.

708
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,699
What are you doing?

709
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,150
Lu Yue, calm down.

710
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,520
Take a breather and calm down.

711
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,440
Calm down.

712
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,219
Out of sight, out of mind.

713
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,360
As long as Lu Yue doesn't keep popping up in front of me,

714
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,620
I'll feel much better.

715
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,530
I know

716
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,120
it's boring to talk about this so seriously,

717
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,590
but that's just how I feel.

718
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,420
I know I'm a professional player,

719
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,290
and what I'm doing isn't anything to be ashamed of,

720
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,870
yet I still can't hold my head high.

721
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,880
Why is that?

722
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,909
I also know

723
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,940
my way of dealing with this is a bit extreme,

724
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,540
but I just can't understand

725
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,969
why someone like Lu Yue can rejoin the team.

726
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,700
So,

727
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,080
what exactly happened a year ago?

728
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,840
Come on.

729
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,590
Everyone worked hard today.

730
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,610
Let's relax and unwind.

731
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,370
-Yeah.
-Come on.

732
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,560
I'm really sorry about today.

733
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,230
It was just pure luck.

734
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,980
A narrow victory, indeed.

735
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,890
Come on. Let's have a drink together.

736
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,940
Come on.

737
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,850
A toast to Mr. Bao and Mr. Pan.

738
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,730
I'll drink first.

739
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,260
Cheers!

740
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,460
It was just an exhibition match anyway.

741
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,060
Chessman isn't here?

742
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,890
He's not feeling well today，

743
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,620
so he didn't come.

744
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,090
Come on, I'll…

745
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,700
Not feeling well?

746
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,700
When he was playing the game earlier,

747
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,360
wasn't he pretty impressive?

748
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,890
This is clearly disrespecting our A.

749
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,770
No, not at all.

750
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,450
How could we disrespect A?

751
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,100
A, let me toast you.

752
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,060
He really isn't feeling well today.

753
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,550
Well,

754
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,860
let's just say we had a slight edge today, okay?

755
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,420
I'm sorry.

756
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,570
A slight edge?

757
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,230
You call a 2-0 victory a slight edge?

758
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,910
You're just looking down on us.

759
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,680
No, no.

760
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,420
I...

761
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,430
Come on.

762
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,230
Today was really just luck.

763
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,240
On behalf of my brother,

764
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,940
I'll give you respect.

765
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,940
A toast to you all.

766
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,840
Yes, this one's from Lu Yue.

767
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,630
This drink counts for Lu Yue.

768
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,170
Come on. Let me personally toast you.

769
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,030
Come on. Let's have one together.

770
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
Come on. Let me pour wine for you all.

771
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,640
Come on. Come on.

772
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,820
Here.

773
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,210
Lu Yue. Lu Yue.

774
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,440
Good.

775
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,840
Impressive.

776
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,740
That's enough.

777
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,500
-You're awesome.
-Friendship first, competition second, right?

778
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,700
Yes, yes, come on.

779
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,510
Are you okay?

780
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,340
Well, come on.

781
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,330
Let me toast everyone. Come on.

782
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:54,780
I'd like to toast everyone.

783
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,220
Come on. Let's all drink together.

784
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,940
Come on. Let's drink up. Drink up!

785
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,610
You've all worked hard, really hard.

786
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,540
Everyone has worked hard today.

787
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,380
It's been tough. Everyone's worked hard.

788
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,860
Come on. Let's drink up!

789
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,060
Come on, everyone, have a drink together.

790
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,660
Let's drink together. Come on. Drink, drink, drink!

791
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,260
Drink!

792
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,100
Later,

793
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,330
Lu Yue probably overheard

794
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,510
A mocking our team in the bathroom.

795
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,820
What the heck is Team ZGDX anyway?

796
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,310
They're all so arrogant.

797
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,480
Exactly!

798
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,130
Especially that guy called Lu Yue.

799
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,500
What's he so cocky about?

800
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Didn't he just get into the team because of Lu Sicheng?

801
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,420
That kid is Lu Sicheng's younger brother.

802
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,840
The Lu family is really too overbearing.

803
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,730
Being cocky in the game is one thing,

804
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,070
but his brother doesn't even show up for tonight's party.

805
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,840
And he still dares to act all high and mighty.

806
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,040
He's not giving our A any respect at all.

807
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,980
A, you absolutely can't let them off the hook.

808
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,970
You've got to teach them a lesson.

809
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,720
Just like his brother, he doesn't know how to show respect.

810
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,430
They dare to disrespect our A.

811
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,630
What the heck.

812
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,110
Lu Yue.

813
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,980
A! A!

814
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,760
God Ming!

815
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,700
God Ming!

816
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,220
God Ming!

817
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,580
Stop it!

818
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,960
I'm calling the police!

819
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,750
-Let's go, A.
-Pro Ming.

820
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,500
Go!

821
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,570
Go! Hurry up!

822
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,610
Quick, let's get out of here.

823
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,040
Things have come to this point,

824
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,710
but God Ming still sides with Lu Yue,

825
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,100
saying that A's insults were too harsh at the time,

826
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,770
and that even a sober person couldn't tolerate them,

827
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,560
let alone a drunk Lu Yue.

828
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,740
He also said

829
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,340
that Lu Yue couldn't bear to hear others say

830
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,370
he joined the team through Cheng's connections.

831
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,020
But what I can't understand is

832
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,370
that if Lu Yue doesn't want to hear others say

833
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,450
he's got connections,

834
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,100
then he should prove himself with his skills.

835
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,480
He resorted to violence after hearing a few insults.

836
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,250
What's that?

837
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,600
Just because of a few insults,

838
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,090
he gets into a fight and even drags God Ming into it.

839
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,580
Why should God Ming bear the consequences

840
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,440
of the conflict between him and A?

841
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,160
God Ming didn't have to retire so early.

842
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,380
Because of Lu Yue's reckless behavior,

843
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,860
we've paid such a high price.

844
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,520
Has no one thought about this?

845
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:15,780
-Hello, sister.
-Jinyang.

846
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,340
-I know…
-I'll call you later.

847
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,630
Yao, don't hang up yet.

848
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,660
Go watch Ai Jia's livestream.

849
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,240
He's defending Lu Yue online right now.

850
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,320
Defending?

851
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,010
Jinyang says we should go watch the livestream.
