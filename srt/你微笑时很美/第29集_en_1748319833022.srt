1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
You don't believe your teammates?

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,120
If you don't believe your teammates,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,520
I want to say that we don't want to be in such a competition.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,640
Mom!

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,800
ZJDX is not my own team.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
It's our team.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,400
I admit that

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
I need you.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,280
Yes.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,240
A family needs to be full of energy.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,120
One can't be less than that.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
ZJDX is not my team.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not your team.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not your team.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not your team.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not your team.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not your team.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not your team.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not your team.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not your team.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not your team.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not your team.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not your team.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not your team.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not your team.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not your team.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not your team.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not your team.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not your team.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not your team.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not your team.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not your team.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not your team.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not your team.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not your team.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not your team.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not your team.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not your team.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not your team.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not your team.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not your team.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not your team.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not your team.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not your team.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not your team.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not your team.

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not your team.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not your team.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not your team.

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not your team.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not your team.

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not your team.

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not your team.

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not your team.

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not your team.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not your team.

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not your team.

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not your team.

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not your team.

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not your team.

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not your team.

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not your team.

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not your team.

64
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not your team.

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not your team.

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here you are.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's weird.

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why am I in the hot water again?

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're not blind.

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Have a bite.

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Have a bite.

72
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hello, Man.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yao Yao.

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You've been in a big trouble lately.

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You won't say no to us, right?

76
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm fine.

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But everyone has solved it for me.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yao Yao.

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're so stupid.

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What are you talking about?

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What are you talking about?

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We've been training for two days.

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Get ready for the game.

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We're busy.

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're pretending.

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What's wrong with you and your team leader?

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well...

88
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's that?

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You should go home early these days.

90
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Bring that Lu along.

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I told you that he's a good guy.

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He's handsome and handsome.

93
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I like him when I see him.

94
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What a mess.

95
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yao Yao.

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you don't come back soon,

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll go to your team's base with your mom.

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll beat you.

99
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No.

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We're going to the game these days.

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll go home on weekends.

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay?

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Remember to bring Lu along.

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll make you some food.

106
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He's busy.

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

108
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's it.

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I...

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well...

111
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My mom said

112
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
she wanted me to go home on weekends.

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
On weekends?

114
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

115
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You haven't been back for a long time.

116
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let me tell Xiaorui.

117
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
My mom also said

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
she wanted me to take you home with me.

119
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay.

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll have the last bite.

121
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Anything else?

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm so nervous.

123
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I haven't prepared it yet.

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Next time, you come again.

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They...

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Mom.

127
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yao Yao.

128
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Lu.

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Aunt.

130
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why isn't she going to the room?

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Come on in.

132
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Old man, they're here.

133
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Come on in.

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm so nervous.

135
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm so nervous.

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm so nervous.

137
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm so nervous.

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm so nervous.

139
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm so nervous.

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm so nervous.

141
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm so nervous.

142
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm so nervous.

143
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm so nervous.

144
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go.

145
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go.

146
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't hesitate.

147
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Put your shoes on.

148
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The first time I came,

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
you should take good care of them.

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There are food and fruits on the table.

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Take some for her.

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Dad, I'm home.

153
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

154
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Good day.

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
You bought it?

156
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,280
Our computer should have changed its mind.

157
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,040
It's still a thunder snake.

158
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
Dad, you're from the Hang family?

159
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,640
Why are you looking at me?

160
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,480
Wait.

161
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,800
Dad, you're watching a live game?

162
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,320
Yes, I'm doing it to catch up with your mom.

163
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,880
Your mom is really good now.

164
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,480
She's almost a professional.

165
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Dad, you bought a new computer

166
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
because of me?

167
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,120
I've been thinking about it.

168
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,760
Recently, I've been doing activities online.

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm still thinking about it.

170
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,360
I just changed my old computer

171
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,960
and changed it to a new one.

172
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,840
How about it?

173
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,760
Really?

174
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,240
You should teach me.

175
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,760
I want to change my phone.

176
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,000
Look, Wu Ji is different from before.

177
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,760
Dad, why don't you try it on your new computer?

178
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,680
I was on my way out when I delivered the goods that day.

179
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,800
I've made an appointment.

180
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll come back another day.

181
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,800
Don't do that.

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,960
Brother Cheng, hurry up.

183
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
It's time for you to do your work.

184
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
Yao Yao, come and wash the dishes for me.

185
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,720
Do your best.

186
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Do your best.

187
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,160
Uncle, let me help you.

188
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,760
Mom, what do you want me to do?

189
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,960
What will you do?

190
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,320
I won't do anything.

191
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,000
Mom, tell me.

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,200
Did you get along well with that Lu

193
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,240
at the beginning?

194
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,040
When I went to the base with your dad,

195
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,240
I thought he was your eyes.

196
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,960
But other boys are different.

197
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,440
What eyes?

198
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
It's like...

199
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,440
This thing is mine.

200
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,800
Understand?

201
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
It's mine?

202
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,680
Didn't you guys not get along well last time?

203
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
How do you know that?

204
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,600
Of course.

205
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm an old warrior.

206
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,080
Can you keep me company?

207
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,600
Okay, okay, mom. Don't say it.

208
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,800
Okay, okay.

209
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,960
It's a joke.

210
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,960
Come here.

211
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm telling you the truth.

212
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,840
No matter how free and open you are

213
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,040
and how young you are,

214
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,120
girls should be careful.

215
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
Before anything happens,

216
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,080
I'm telling you in a calm way.

217
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,720
But if there's any accident,

218
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,240
you must tell me.

219
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,040
I won't blame you.

220
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,480
I'll help you.

221
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,880
So you can't mess up.

222
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,000
Promise me.

223
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,160
Okay, I got it.

224
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,960
Don't be shy.

225
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,280
I'll take it.

226
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,760
Have some tea.

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,920
Thank you, uncle.

228
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,800
Please sit down.

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,840
I've made it.

230
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,520
Have a look.

231
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
So fast?

232
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,560
Okay.

233
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,440
Okay, okay.

234
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,680
Is Yao Yao's hand better?

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,040
She's better now.

236
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,280
Don't worry, uncle.

237
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
Yao Yao is very sharp.

238
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,200
She's actually quite sensitive.

239
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,280
She can't be soft in the eyes.

240
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,200
She's not in love with her.

241
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,360
Uncle, I know.

242
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,560
I won't object to your friendship.

243
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
But as her father,

244
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,600
I must make sure of it.

245
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you serious?

246
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,280
Have you ever considered

247
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,520
your future?

248
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,840
Or are you still in a mood?

249
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,600
I know.

250
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,040
You have a lot of female fans in your career.

251
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,080
Especially for you.

252
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,520
If it's a kind of attitude,

253
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't agree with you two.

254
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,480
Let's talk about it.

255
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,480
Do you really like my daughter?

256
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,840
I must make sure of it.

257
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,480
Uncle, don't worry.

258
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,880
I'll take responsibility for her.

259
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,280
After all,

260
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,880
I can't meet a girl like Tong Yao.

261
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,080
Okay.

262
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,680
Brother Cheng, what did you tell my father?

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,960
What did you say?

264
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,720
I heard it.

265
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,880
You heard it?

266
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,680
I heard you said I can't find it even if I hit the light.

267
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,880
And...

268
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,080
What else?

269
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
And...

270
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
You said you'll take responsibility for me.

271
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,520
What?

272
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
You can't hear it clearly?

273
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
I said you said you would...

274
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,880
I'll take responsibility for you.

275
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Wu Si Cheng,

276
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,040
even if I hit the light,

277
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,880
I can find someone better than you.

278
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I won't look for it.

279
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,880
You want to find someone better than me.

280
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,880
If you want to hit the light and find someone else,

281
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,680
I'll take the place that I set up.

282
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
President Ba Dao.

283
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,680
Right.

284
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Your President Ba Dao.

285
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Supreme Commander Coca.

286
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,200
討論

287
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,400
Old curve?

288
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,840
Why don't you go to bed?

289
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Go, go, go.

290
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,040
What time is it?

291
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,440
I have to study to practice your body language.

292
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,040
Watch the video of your graduation.

293
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Where is he?

294
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,880
Let me ask you something.

295
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,080
Do you think you're still young?

296
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,720
Why can't I?

297
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,760
Look at your brain.

298
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,360
What are you doing with it every day?

299
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,920
I mean, you're so young.

300
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,120
Your reaction speed,

301
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,320
your control,

302
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,240
compared to when you were a teenager,

303
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,560
did you change anything?

304
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
You're asking this.

305
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
There must be a change.

306
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,520
So every professional player

307
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,400
is more and more practice.

308
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,720
After all,

309
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm not a puppy.

310
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,840
So I'm going to start

311
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,360
training the next group of puppies.

312
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,680
What do you mean?

313
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm not a puppy.

314
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm just a puppy.

315
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm just a puppy.

316
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,480
I'm just a puppy.

317
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
I'm just a puppy.

318
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,480
I'm just a puppy.

319
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm just a puppy.

320
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,480
I'm just a puppy.

321
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,040
I'm just a puppy.

322
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
I'm just a puppy.

323
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,080
I'm just a puppy.

324
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,640
I'm just a puppy.

325
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,080
I'm just a puppy.

326
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm just a puppy.

327
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm just a puppy.

328
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,400
I'm just a puppy.

329
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,640
I'm just a puppy.

330
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,080
I'm just a puppy.

331
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,720
I'm just a puppy.

332
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,120
You're сами+.

333
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,880
She can't tell you how he is.

334
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
You naturally have feelings.

335
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,440
So there should be something you can teach him.

336
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,080
science teacher.

337
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
I talked to a investor who just came back from China

338
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
and talked about the inspiration.

339
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm now doing the raising plan of the top-tier electrician.

340
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
I've made it for you.

341
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
What?

342
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
I really didn't expect that

343
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
you said you want to be the top-tier electrician

344
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
as your career. Is that true?

345
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Of course it's true.

346
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
It's good.

347
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
I found that

348
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
our changes in the past half of the year are quite big.

349
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
It's quite a big change.

350
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
You've already made the top-tier electrician

351
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,080
for the past half of the year.

352
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Who said that you would never

353
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
date an electrician?

354
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
You're so mean.

355
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
You're even more embarrassed to say that I did.

356
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Who said that you and the top-tier electrician

357
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
are not as good as you are?

358
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Okay.

359
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Come on.

360
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Jin Yang.

361
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
I'm going to淘汰 soon.

362
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
I'm going to see CK.

363
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Are you nervous?

364
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Not at all.

365
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
It feels like half a year has passed

366
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
like a dream.

367
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
I was sitting in front of the computer

368
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
and watching other people doing their job.

369
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
I was so happy to see that.

370
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
How long have they been in the company?

371
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm the one who was so happy.

372
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Don't worry.

373
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
If anyone finds out that I'm the one

374
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,080
who's the happy one,

375
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,040
If I sent that to me half a year ago

376
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,680
and invited Xiaorui as a liar,

377
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,880
I wouldn't have been here today.

378
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,680
There will be.

379
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,880
But it's just another kind of thing.

380
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
You're destined to be in this circle and be hot-headed.

381
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Really?

382
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,480
Like I thought about many possibilities for myself.

383
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,280
But I'm not in the same boat with Ai Jia.

384
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
That makes sense.

385
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Sometimes, life is like a limitless possibility.

386
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,680
But there aren't many possibilities.

387
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,880
If I chose the path I wanted,

388
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,880
whether I got the great loss or the great happiness,

389
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
it's all up to her.

390
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,480
So, I just have to regret it.

391
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
That's the reason, Jinmei.

392
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,880
Of course.

393
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
So, regret it?

394
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
No.

395
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
With the victory of the C1K team,

396
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,880
the 2020 OPL finals is officially on the rise.

397
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,280
In the end, the other teams will start to prepare for the next game.

398
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,080
From the results of the entry-level game,

399
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,680
the current ZGDX, CK and YQCB

400
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,080
are very clear about the situation.

401
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,280
And no matter from the battle or the first person,

402
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
they have a certain objective.

403
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
According to our previous analysis,

404
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,280
the first round of the game is relatively simple for these three teams.

405
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,680
ZGDX should be able to win the blue team.

406
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,680
And CK met the legendary team Fnatic in the first round.

407
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,280
But with the entry-level game of the Yang Shicun,

408
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I will pressure one CK.

409
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,680
If CK can win Fnatic,

410
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,680
then ZGDX will soon meet their legendary opponent,

411
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
CK.

412
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,680
CK, the old opponents.

413
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,080
You all know their characteristics.

414
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
They are all the same.

415
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,280
Especially Yang,

416
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,280
who has been in the elimination game and in a good condition.

417
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,480
How is it?

418
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Are you confident?

419
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,880
Yes!

420
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,880
How do I feel a little nervous?

421
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
No, no.

422
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Let's go!

423
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Are you nervous?

424
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Stop biting.

425
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Your lips are about to break.

426
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Are you feeling better?

427
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
A little bit red.

428
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Is it soft?

429
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Do you want me to hug you?

430
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
I'm here.

431
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Let's go.

432
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Hello, everyone.

433
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Welcome to the competition of the national team of OPL.

434
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
I am Ah Heng, the elder sister of Fnatic.

435
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Hello, everyone.

436
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I am the legendary leader of the world.

437
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Now we can see the two teams have been eliminated.

438
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,280
The competition will begin soon.

439
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Huang Chuan, Yu Zaoqian, and Jiu Tian, move out.

440
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
The CK team moved out

441
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Huang Chuan, Yu Zaoqian and Jiu Tian.

442
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
It seems that they are more focused on the mid-way.

443
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Yes, it seems that the mid-way is more strong.

444
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Fang Fang, let's move out.

445
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Let's move out.

446
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Let's move out.

447
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Let's move out.

448
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
The CK team moved out

449
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Jue, Shan Feng and Jin Fangzhu.

450
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Let's get the bow and arrow.

451
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
The CK team's first round

452
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
got the bow and arrow.

453
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Jian Yang got the bow and arrow.

454
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Good.

455
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
I'm so scared.

456
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Do you have any memory of your childhood diary?

457
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Can you put down the problem of the childhood diary first?

458
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
It's good to have a bad time.

459
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Tong Yao, the other team put Huang Chuan out.

460
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
How about it?

461
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
It's hard to hit the green chicken.

462
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
It's a bit hard.

463
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
It's hard.

464
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
As long as the yellow one is AD, it's a good one.

465
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Brother Cheng, you are too bold.

466
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Tong Yao, you are forced to go to Liangshan by our brother Cheng.

467
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
I'll give you a good song.

468
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Come on, MC, drop the beat.

469
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
The CK team moved out.

470
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
The CK team moved out.

471
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
The CK team moved out.

472
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
The CK team moved out.

473
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Everybody, follow me.

474
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Lu Jian Bu, you are the best.

475
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
The CK team moved out.

476
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
We are not small.

477
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
We are on the same road.

478
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
What a man without feelings.

479
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Brother Cheng, Xiao Pang.

480
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,280
You have to choose the bow and arrow for the old cat.

481
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
The CK team moved out.

482
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
The CK team moved out.

483
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
The middle team chose Huang.

484
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
The second team moved out.

485
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
The difference is the fox and the sheep.

486
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
The CK team chose the purple-eyed copper boy.

487
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
The CK team moved out.

488
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
The CK team moved out.

489
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
The CK team moved out.

490
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
The CK team moved out.

491
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
The black-eyed copper boy.

492
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Come on.

493
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Come on.

494
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Come on.

495
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Slow down.

496
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Be careful.

497
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
God Yang, you are on the road.

498
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Be careful.

499
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
The sun is coming.

500
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Why didn't you come to protect me?

501
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I said Lu Jian Bu is not good.

502
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
But the road is flat.

503
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm coming, too.

504
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
We should be on the same road.

505
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Let's have a good fight.

506
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
I can't calm down the old cat's tongue.

507
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
It's too late.

508
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
The next round is too late.

509
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
The second round is too late.

510
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
The bell is ringing.

511
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
I'll go first.

512
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
I'll go first.

513
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
I'll go first.

514
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
God Yang and the good-natured come to play the game.

515
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Go ahead.

516
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
The young master is on the road.

517
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
No need to come.

518
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
The young master is on the road.

519
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
The road is flat.

520
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
The fox and the sheep are on the road.

521
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Okay.

522
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
The ice-cream push is not big.

523
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
It's not.

524
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
No.

525
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
But don't worry about God Yang.

526
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Brother Cheng can be a good hunter.

527
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Okay.

528
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
I feel very comfortable.

529
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Let's have a good game.

530
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
What kind of gun is it?

531
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
I speak normally.

532
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
It's your face that looks like a流氓.

533
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
When you speak, you look like a流氓.

534
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
When you don't speak,

535
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:19,440
you look like a

536
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Help me wait.

537
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
God Yang is here, too.

538
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
The second round is too late.

539
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
The second round is too late.

540
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
The second round is too late.

541
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
The second round is too late.

542
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
We're shook.

543
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
It's too hard.

544
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
I feel like I'm going to be tired.

545
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
I can drive very time-consuming for five minutes a day.

546
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
There wasn't so much time.

547
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
After a bereits,

548
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,860
a hurry dell

549
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
and everything changed from the hot and cold to swim чит

550
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
until the body and legs are clear.

551
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,960
We still have theisode,

552
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:50,540
that

553
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,420
into a mount,

554
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,980
fealty and attractive

555
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,820
I count the deposition and arrive at the mount

556
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
But you are an imposter

557
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,460
and you know I Gemini

558
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm so spoil

559
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,460
They meant to hide

560
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,300
but fell at the line

561
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,340
Be careful

562
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,140
They should also have gone in

563
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,180
I go and push you in

564
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,380
Mouse, you again

565
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,260
My luck is all available

566
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,060
soon

567
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,460
It's all under control

568
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,260
Have you tried anything

569
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,340
Penetrate and eliminated

570
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Good

571
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,900
Dearstep sea of 시떴

572
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,340
So P deu

573
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm afraid you have some misunderstanding about yourself.

574
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,540
It's so obvious that you can catch me.

575
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
I'm getting older.

576
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,540
The reaction has slowed down.

577
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
I didn't say anything.

578
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
Look.

579
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
4 to 2 is the head.

580
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,540
We have two heads in the lead.

581
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,540
The economy is not as good as CK.

582
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
I'm crying.

583
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,540
If we can get a snake,

584
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
come.

585
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Let's hide next to the snake.

586
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
I'm coming, Brother Qin.

587
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,540
Old Meng.

588
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Open the big snake business.

589
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
CK, the big snake, open the big snake business.

590
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,540
Open the big snake business.

591
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
We have to release any skills.

592
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
Yang Chen.

593
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
Yang Chen.

594
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
The snake is jumping.

595
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Look at the old man now.

596
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
Old Meng.

597
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
The old man is getting a snake.

598
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
The snake is jumping.

599
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
The snake is getting a snake.

600
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
The snake is jumping.

601
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
The snake is jumping.

602
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Get your voice back.

603
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
The snake is getting a snake.

604
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
The snake is getting a snake.

605
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
The CK is successful.

606
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,540
Nice.

607
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,540
This is the real team.

608
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,540
Is it the middle of CK?

609
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,540
Or the difference between ZGDX and ZGDX?

610
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
It's really amazing.

611
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
It's really amazing.

612
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
All of you, step back.

613
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
Okay.

614
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,540
Go up.

615
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Go straight.

616
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,540
ZGDX is starting to push.

617
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,540
ZGDX seems to be back to power.

618
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
It seems that

619
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
he is really going to prepare for the game.

620
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,540
The game is over.

621
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
Congratulations to ZGDX.

622
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
Congratulations to ZGDX.

623
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Congratulations to ZGDX.

624
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,540
Yes.

625
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
Yes.

626
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
Yes.

627
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
Congratulations to ZGDX.

628
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Okay, I got it.

629
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,540
I'm playing the game now.

630
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,540
Okay.

631
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,540
I'll call you later.

632
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
Brother Chen, look.

633
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,540
Last time you were hiding from the pool.

634
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,540
Yes.

635
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,540
You were fighting with me last time.

636
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
Since that,

637
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
I won't be in the game

638
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,540
if we meet again.

639
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,540
Okay.

640
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
Let's meet at the game.

641
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
I was a little bit careless.

642
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
Who was so good at the game?

643
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,540
I didn't expect that

644
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
I would be my team.

645
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
I didn't expect that I would be my team.

646
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,540
I just knew that he was going to play the game.

647
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
I was surprised.

648
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,540
In fact, after breaking up,

649
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,540
I haven't contacted him for a long time.

650
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
I didn't expect that he would come to play the game.

651
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,540
Actually, I didn't think about it at first.

652
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
I didn't think about breaking up with him.

653
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,540
So I'd like to thank you for your high-ranking.

654
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,540
Otherwise, I wouldn't have the chance to be in the game.

655
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
Come on, next game.

656
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,540
I'll lose this spring game to you guys.

657
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
I'm not ready to lose this year.

658
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,540
Okay.

659
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
By the way,

660
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
don't tell him that I'm going to play the game.

661
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,540
I'm not convinced.

662
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
I know you're still in danger.

663
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,540
I'll take care of it.

664
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
I'll take care of it.

665
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
Okay.

666
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Lu Si Chuan, did you take a peek?

667
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
No, I didn't.

668
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
I won't.

669
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
Definitely not.

670
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
No.

671
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
No.

672
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
No, please.

673
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
No.

674
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
No.

675
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,540
No.

676
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,380
during the battle,

677
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,780
you must pay attention to the distance between the middle and the wild areas.

678
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,180
Because you have to form a form that is less than a week.

679
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,020
According to the strategy I made,

680
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,100
you must play this ZGDX, okay?

681
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:53,900
Come on.

682
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,460
Come on.

683
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,700
One, two, three.

684
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Come on.

685
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,700
Come on, let's go.

686
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,620
Xiao Hua,

687
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,620
you have to be careful.

688
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,340
Tong Yaohe may choose Yu Zaoqian next round

689
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,140
to teach you a lesson.

690
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,700
Don't mention Yu Zaoqian to me.

691
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,940
I'm so worried.

692
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,740
I'll deal with him next round.

693
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,780
God Yang,

694
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,980
what do you choose next round?

695
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,060
Gu Hu Niao.

696
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:14,900
Sure...

697
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,660
At that time you were a little microdot.

698
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,060
What are you doing?

699
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,740
I've moved a tiger.

700
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,500
A tiger?

701
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,940
So we have to move one tiger?

702
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,540
Father.

703
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,900
Overcome a tiger.

704
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,780
What's nice about the state of your brother?

705
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,460
My brother is my friend.

706
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,260
Second Brother Nu.

707
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,420
First clasp of liberty.

708
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,220
His plate is tremor.

709
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
What's good about it?

710
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,540
It's a favor.

711
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,100
What favor?

712
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,540
It's nothing.

713
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,220
White radish,

714
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,740
steamed rice,

715
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,420
green onion,

716
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,220
and hand-wrapped rice.

717
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,300
People who lie don't deserve these.

718
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,460
When did I lie?

719
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,340
You said you were in a broth.

720
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
I didn't eat the broth just now.

721
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,900
You have a bad smell in your mouth.

722
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,660
You're too obvious.

723
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,260
When I went to the washroom,

724
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,660
which lady gave you the food?

725
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,700
You told me in advance.

726
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
I'm not a sugar-coated patient.

727
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,020
Why are you so strict?

728
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,860
Who was the mastermind?

729
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,980
We have the flight attendant today.

730
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,740
Whatitions?

731
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,220
Nothing, right?

732
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,900
No.

733
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:15,940
I have told you.

734
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,780
There was one person who came earlier than me.

735
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Online.

736
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,780
That person,

737
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,300
was I at your place?

738
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,220
Manager Guo.

739
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,660
I'm here to thank you for helping them

740
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,660
for taking care of oursamao Meanwhile team.

741
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,620
The verdict kilograms

742
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,220
say it yourself,

743
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,580
something is thanks to trials and errors.

744
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,420
Boss Han,

745
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,600
I think we should

746
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,920
What's wrong with him?

747
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,320
He's a good guy.

748
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,440
He's not a good guy.

749
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,480
Why did he come to Xia Hu Baobao?

750
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Lu Yue can't even breathe.

751
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,840
What's wrong with him?

752
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,680
Every time Lu Yue smiles,

753
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,080
he's happy.

754
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,280
He suddenly feels a little sad.

755
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,520
What's wrong with him?

756
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,000
I bet 10 hammocks.

757
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,040
Lu Yue is now fighting.

758
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,000
Chen He, you need to get the black bucket.

759
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay.

760
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,320
Okay.

761
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,760
The three teams have chosen

762
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,640
to start the game.

763
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,640
Let's start.

764
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,320
You're still looking at the top.

765
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,440
I think it's not easy

766
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,920
to get the black bucket.

767
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,640
Okay.

768
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,480
Come on.

769
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,120
You're so stubborn.

770
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,760
You can't get the black bucket.

771
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,360
Come on.

772
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
The top is coming.

773
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,840
Two-on-one.

774
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,880
This is the top.

775
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Go up.

776
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,720
Come on.

777
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,680
Come on.

778
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,960
The old man is out.

779
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,360
Wow.

780
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,440
You lost again.

781
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,600
Do you think you can't win?

782
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,320
Whop.

783
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,240
You can save me this time.

784
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,680
Look at me.

785
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,120
What a great situation.

786
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,480
Must have sounded.

787
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,920
You also gotta get your big bucket

788
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,240
to hang yourself.

789
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,040
Wonderful.

790
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,240
Talk to them.

791
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,380
Code.

792
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,600
Code.

793
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,020
Code.

794
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,740
Code.

795
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,960
Code.

796
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,160
Code.

797
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,160
Code.

798
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,560
Code.

799
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,560
Code.

800
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,600
Code.

801
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,400
Code.

802
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,740
Code.

803
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,460
The more you fight, the worse it is.

804
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,220
It's okay.

805
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,180
Keep fighting.

806
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,820
Keep fighting.

807
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,060
You...

808
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,500
You're giving Shang Lu a father.

809
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,500
Old Meng opened the ice line after signing the contract.

810
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,220
He came down.

811
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,100
Okay.

812
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,220
Get ready.

813
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,540
I'll come when I finish the line.

814
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,980
Xiaopang, let's push the line forward.

815
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,860
Then we'll go to the pool.

816
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,540
Okay.

817
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:01,900
Go, go, go.

818
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,620
I'll go.

819
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,460
Get him.

820
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,220
Get him.

821
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,740
Get the hydrants.

822
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,620
We've seen the flying fish up there.

823
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,380
The water flares.

824
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,580
The literally flash coming from the water flares.

825
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,700
concerns you.

826
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,880
To

827
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,380
Set the fire alarm.

828
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,140
This is so great.

829
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,380
The marausilu is so strong.

830
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,980
How can theчue team lose power anymore?

831
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,740
Give it to me.

832
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,620
Awesome!

833
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,580
So great.

834
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,840
It's you with the needle.

835
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,100
Let's go.

836
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,420
Continue playing.

837
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,260
DK is too steady.

838
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,180
DK managed to beat DM among виде kinds.

839
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,760
It's ago now.

840
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,680
larry.

841
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,800
DK's is key P3 coach.

842
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,260
Fore Adm. DK went fast.

843
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,860
This one hit statement is so good.

844
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,940
Not bad.

845
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,240
It's sitting right!

846
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,800
You got it, let's go

847
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,640
You got it, now you know it

848
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,640
You got it, now you know it

849
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,840
You got it, now you know it

850
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,640
You got it, now you know it

851
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
I can't understand their evil spirit

852
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Enough, stop thinking

853
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,840
You Linjia, you're so stupid

854
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,040
Chengguan, what are you thinking?

855
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,040
I'm thinking

856
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
If I didn't play with Jianyang

857
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,440
I might lose this game

858
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm warning you

859
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,840
We're only 1 to 1

860
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,040
We haven't lost the game yet

861
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,640
But what's the joke?

862
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,440
When did you meet Jianyang?

863
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,840
When we were resting

864
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,640
The toilet was safe

865
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,240
You said you didn't steal the candy

866
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,840
You can't go to the toilet in the future

867
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,240
You got the report and approved the food

868
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,440
Report, report

869
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,240
What?

870
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,440
Niaoji, the ghost is coming

871
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,640
You can't go

872
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,840
The last game

873
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,840
Mom

874
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,640
Didn't you say that the nine-toned fat sister

875
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm a ghost

876
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,640
There's a ghost切

877
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,440
Look at the ghost

878
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,640
Why don't you know it?

879
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Why don't you know it?

880
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,040
Tongya, you, you let the toilet go

881
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,640
You can't let it go

882
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,840
You're going to the toilet, right?

883
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,240
Come here, I'll check

884
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,640
Do you have any candy?

885
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Take off your clothes

886
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Open your legs

887
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Do you have any candy in your shoes?

888
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
Why don't you go with me?

889
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
You can't see the ghost

890
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
You're so stupid

891
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
You're so stupid

892
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
What are you looking at?

893
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
I didn't dare to speak loudly just now

894
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,440
I lost the game before

895
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,640
I was always in the face

896
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
Who dares to speak

897
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,440
I'm not aware of the situation

898
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,640
I'm here to be a soldier

899
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,840
A soldier

900
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,040
Don't be afraid

901
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,440
He's very kind

902
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,640
Just like the next CK team

903
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,840
I paid 100,000 fake money to his account

904
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,240
You worked hard

905
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
I think so too

906
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,240
This is the third game of the CK team

907
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,440
The ZGDX team

908
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,040
The third game of the CK team

909
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,640
Now the BT ring has ended

910
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,440
We will officially enter the game right away

911
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,240
Now the mid-to-late double-play starts to play

912
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,040
This is the god

913
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,840
In the process of the early game and the early game

914
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,040
It may be a little disappointing

915
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,640
But if you can get some head-to-head advantages

916
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,240
It's very easy to find the master of the god

917
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,540
Yang Shen goes to play on the top

918
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,040
And the ZGDX team

919
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,840
The CK team can reach level 4 after this game

920
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,040
In this case, whether it's the mid-to-late or the low-to-late

921
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,640
How long do you have to play?

922
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,840
Come and play a game

923
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,240
I feel like I'm going to lose

924
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
OK

925
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,560
The CK team has already been in the low-to-late

926
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,240
Xiaopang, go up the top

927
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
Coming

928
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
The low-to-late is hot again

929
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,040
Yes, Yang Shen's night is going up

930
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,840
Go

931
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,040
CK is out

932
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,840
Don't let him go

933
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,240
Don't let him go

934
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,640
Yang Shen is out

935
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
It's okay

936
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,840
It's okay

937
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Nice

938
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,240
If you can play with Xiaopang

939
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,640
You can directly win a game

940
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,040
And take him away

941
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
And finish the game

942
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,040
Seeing this, I can guess

943
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,360
Whether it's watching live

944
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,440
Or the fans of the ZGDX team

945
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,840
You can rest assured

946
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,560
There was no competition in the past

947
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,840
They didn't give you a bad impression

948
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,040
Mr. Neng, go to the mid lane first

949
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,440
Don't catch this difficult game

950
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,040
The CK team has a head-on

951
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,840
The world is taken by them

952
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,640
Xiaopang, K

953
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,040
Who do you want to take two?

954
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,640
OK, don't be noisy

955
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,440
Let me finish the money and experience first

956
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,440
They are afraid of catching them

957
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,240
If you can't catch them, you can't go to the mid lane

958
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,040
Yang Shen can't catch you anyway

959
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,440
You are quite emotional now

960
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Little brother will send you to the mid lane later

961
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
You talk so much

962
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,240
Why don't you stop the vision?

963
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,040
I won't

964
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,240
I'm poor, I want to play

965
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,640
You are so petty in the game

966
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,440
Can you play in the game?

967
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,640
He said Yang Shen won't come to the mid lane

968
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I think he doesn't look like anyone

969
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,040
Yang Shen, go to the mid lane

970
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
What are you laughing at?

971
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Your fans heard your scream

972
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
Impossible

973
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,440
I heard it just now

974
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,640
A female lioness was sent to the VGDX computer area

975
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,840
The god of the world

976
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,640
No wonder they say that the VGDX team is bad

977
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,240
That's right

978
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,840
Come, let's play a big game

979
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,440
OK

980
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,040
Old man, old K

981
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,240
You are on the top of the snake pit

982
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
The friend is on the left of the snake pit

983
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,840
Xiaopang is with me in the middle of the snake pit

984
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Coming

985
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,240
Go up, go up, go up

986
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,440
VGDX, open the big game

987
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
They started

988
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,040
Not too soon, they didn't play so fast

989
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Go to the box first

990
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,640
I'm coming

991
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,440
OK

992
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
Yang Shen is starting to play

993
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,440
Be careful, someone is coming to the other side

994
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,040
Still playing?

995
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
My husband is not well

996
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,240
Otherwise, I would have been robbed

997
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,640
Let's go, let's go, let's go

998
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,040
Keep the skill

999
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Let's go to the green field

1000
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,840
Let's take a step back

1001
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,640
OK

1002
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,840
OK, good

1003
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,440
No, they didn't go back

1004
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,240
But the people are in the jungle

1005
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,840
But the jungle is in this position

1006
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,440
Go, go

1007
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,240
The game is up

1008
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Yang Shen is behind

1009
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm behind, I'm behind

1010
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,240
Hu Di

1011
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,040
I'm behind

1012
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
The king of the jungle is being controlled by the dragon

1013
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,440
I'm being cut, the king is your man

1014
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
I'm controlled

1015
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
The king is down

1016
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,840
Xiaopang, go up

1017
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Xiaopang, open the big game

1018
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
Here it comes

1019
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Hu Di is in danger

1020
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Double kill

1021
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,440
You can't be big, friend

1022
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
The king is down again

1023
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,040
You are going to see the little flower

1024
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Can the little flower run away

1025
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Little flower

1026
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
The little flower is also dead

1027
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Yang Shen, go

1028
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Go

1029
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,440
This step is too old

1030
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,040
You can go

1031
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
I'm going to chase

1032
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
I'm going to chase

1033
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
There's a trap in the middle

1034
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Go back to the first wave

1035
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
OK, good

1036
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Come on, come on

1037
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
Now we see

1038
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
ZZZZX has already returned to the high ground

1039
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,640
There is only Yang Shen left

1040
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,040
It seems that there is only one wave

1041
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
Yang Shen is still in the water

1042
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
The fox is back to the sky

1043
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
But Yang Shen is going to sleep

1044
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
OK, go up

1045
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Not him, not him

1046
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
OK

1047
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
ZZZZZZZ

1048
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
Come on, come on, come on

1049
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

1050
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Go down

1051
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
The fox is back to the water

1052
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
The pack is in the water

1053
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
The pack is in the water

1054
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
The pack is in the water

1055
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
The pack is gone

1056
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
The pack is gone

1057
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Easy, easy, easy, easy

1058
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Just now we went big

1059
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Not bad

1060
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Go

1061
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm so happy.

1062
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm so happy.

1063
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,120
I'm so happy.

1064
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
So happy.

1065
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I'm so happy.

1066
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
So happy.

1067
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
So happy.

1068
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm so happy.

1069
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
I finally knew

1070
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
the reason why you said we were not suitable.

1071
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
I wish you happiness.

1072
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
I said we should talk about it again.

1073
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,120
You really want to come.

1074
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Yes.

1075
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,120
I hope to see you on the stage of the World Cup.

1076
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Okay.

1077
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
See you at the World Cup.

1078
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,200
Let's go.

1079
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,200
Let's go.

1080
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,200
I'm so happy.

1081
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,200
I'm so happy.

1082
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,200
I'm so happy.

1083
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,200
I'm so happy.

1084
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,200
I'm so happy.
