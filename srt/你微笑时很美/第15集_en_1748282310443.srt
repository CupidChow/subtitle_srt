00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm Zulu

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,680
Luo you seem to pass the malfunction

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,120
if something like this

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
affect the situation in the world

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm a kid.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,920
Do you have a discount for this weekend?

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,320
We can...

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
I want to play a game.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,120
I'll go to see you play.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,920
My brother hasn't come back yet.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,120
It means he believes in you.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,720
We'll have grass soon.

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:17,760
Owners Boss

19
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,220
Hello, sis.

20
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,720
What's wrong?

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Jian Yang,

22
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,920
our captain is going to Xiang Qing today.

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,320
That's why why you didn't come?

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,160
I have a relationship with the captain's family.

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
I'm not compared to him.

26
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,320
Why should I be a man?

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,880
What's so great about it?

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,320
Will Brother Cheng care about whether he's a student of law or finance?

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,920
But I need to take care of it to find a wife.

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Or give me a Harry Potter that can imitate me.

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,320
I suggest you pray for Brother Cheng to be a unique and reliable person.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Why should I pray for him to like him?

33
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,720
Then why do you have to be so close to him?

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm not. I just want to be with you.

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,720
You should start with the pen, okay?

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,720
In this world, there are not so many people like you.

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
You're tall and pretty.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
You're a good family member and a good student.

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,720
You know how to play games and draw. You're also good.

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Get out.

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,720
You sound so unreliable.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
You're laughing. I'm going to teach you.

43
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay, okay.

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
By the way, it's raining.

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
You can come out and eat some food.

46
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Brother, you can add some food to your food.

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
You can grow taller.

48
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Goodbye.

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
What are you looking at?

50
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Why are you back so early?

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Tong Yao.

52
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Where's my food?

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
I have a meal.

54
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
You're so small.

55
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
It's just this.

56
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
You don't have to be so excessive.

57
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
It's just that.

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Don't blame me for not being home.

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
What?

60
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Are you satisfied with the food or is it my brother's food?

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
You're so stupid.

62
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Come fishing.

63
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
It's forbidden!

64
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Throw them all.

65
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,080
Thanks, that was Awesome.

69
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,280

70
00:05:50,280 --> 00:06:10,680

75
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,940

Nice!

77
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,060
The captain 짜 is nothing but billiard.

78
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,160
Dating two characters,

79
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,500
rote their furs to squirm

80
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,100
but there're two theories

81
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,020
which is my main outlet.

82
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,640
The atmosphere

83
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,540
shows the characters have excellent casting.

84
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,120
Ms,

85
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,340
there's another person

86
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,340
who's already good for it.

87
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,880
What did you two

88
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,440
add to the conversation

89
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:53,980
which is interesting?

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,420
Our chat group's chat box?

91
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,960
Char 것처럼.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,820
S dressing shoulders?

93
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,120
For so many times,

94
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
is she a wearer?

95
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,900
Haven't I shadowed her?

96
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,580
I'm still handsome.

97
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
You're handsome?

98
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,980
Wait.

99
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,420
Didn't we already talk to the big brother?

100
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,180
We didn't let him go.

101
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
How could this happen?

102
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,980
Come on.

103
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,620
Who told you not to let him go?

104
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
What's wrong with you?

105
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,060
My stomach hurts.

106
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,380
I'm thinking.

107
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,380
What?

108
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,860
It's a call to the Great Nature.

109
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,780
A kind of strong call.

110
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Little Lasiang.

111
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
Little Lasiang.

112
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Little Lasiang.

113
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,780
This must be working.

114
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,340
4 Time Limit

115
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,360
No, no.

116
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,220
Brother Luo,

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,860

118
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,920
I can't play for 7 days now.

119
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,340
I still want more connects.

120
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,140
Don't be afraid.

121
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,760
I'm holding you in my life.

122
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,780
Pardon us.

123
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,000
We have the music pool.

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,920
Cheng,Cause Cheng, Fighting!

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,160
Firstly, I americanical win males

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,600
Once again, I offered cold and light front massage

127
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,900
forgave lots of shaved ice

128
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,140
the name is so awesome

129
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
It's welcome to do an interview in the 60s

130
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,500
The"]the sales somewhat differently

131
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,480
is a crown look

132
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,020
I think

133
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,260
the smile of ZGPX

134
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,800
is always big

135
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,720
Let's keep fighting as we think and show them that you're beautiful.

136
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
You are very beautiful.

137
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,520
I'm so confused.

138
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
Today is the day of the mid-way.

139
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,280
You can watch the video yourself.

140
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,640
If you get solo killed once,

141
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I'll take your S.I.S.E. video back.

142
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,320
Buy a super-sized TV.

143
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,280
You can broadcast 24 hours a day.

144
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,040
If you get solo killed twice, I'll broadcast for two days.

145
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,400
If you get solo killed three times, I'll broadcast for three days.

146
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,960
You're too much.

147
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,360
Don't challenge him.

148
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Maybe our Mr. Lu really made a public broadcast for you.

149
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Kei, my face is red?

150
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,880
It was just a flip-flop.

151
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,720
Where is it now?

152
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,360
The stem.

153
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,120
Now we can see that the two mountains are ready.

154
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,520
Let's start the game.

155
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,120
Take the camera.

156
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,320
Okay.

157
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,320
ZGTX has moved to the right.

158
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,800
Shansong.

159
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
I want to play the wave this time.

160
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,960
This board is really good.

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,080
Don't be afraid.

162
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
I've been practicing for a few days.

163
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,600
I can't use it.

164
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm not safe now.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
You know what? I want to play the wave.

166
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,280
No.

167
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,600
You'd better choose the red one.

168
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,120
The old cat from the GTV is chosen.

169
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,480
You can choose the one you want.

170
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,840
I'll take the white one.

171
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,800
You can ask the other one.

172
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,640
You can check the board.

173
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,920
Okay?

174
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,040
I can check it.

175
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,280
I'll give you a hint.

176
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,960
White wood ghost.

177
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Okay, let's start the group.

178
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,240
Okay.

179
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,920
We're in the middle.

180
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,800
Are you excited?

181
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,080
Take the yellow one and the waist.

182
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,960
Calm down.

183
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
No.

184
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,080
The other one didn't move the sky.

185
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,160
You can take the sky.

186
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Miss.

187
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,920
Do you believe that some people

188
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,760
don't talk or act like they should.

189
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,360
They should be in the middle of the group.

190
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,400
We'll be in the middle of the group.

191
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,480
Everyone, fighting.

192
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Okay.

193
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,880
Go in.

194
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
Go in.

195
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,400
Go five.

196
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,880
Five.

197
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,360
Five.

198
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,800
Go.

199
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,080
Yes.

200
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,720
Four.

201
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,920
Same.

202
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,400
And what is this?

203
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,440
What are you looking at?

204
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,560
Open the door and open the door.

205
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,800
Go up and open the door.

206
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,280
What kind of dirty business is this?

207
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,160
I haven't seen it before.

208
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,240
But I can't say that.

209
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
This Kun's ten thousand years old

210
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,160
is still very explosive.

211
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,200
If you can go there,

212
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
you can defeat 1.3 of them.

213
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,760
The two of them are all here.

214
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
Now it's really Smiling.

215
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,520
He can only be the first to be sent down.

216
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,560
Let's take a look at Kun's position.

217
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,880
Kun is still in the middle.

218
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,400
Go, go, go.

219
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
You're here.

220
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
Open the door and open the door.

221
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,040
Go down.

222
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,960
What are you doing?

223
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,160
The yellow one is in the middle.

224
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,840
The yellow one is in the middle.

225
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,040
Go up and open the door.

226
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Can we go?

227
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,240
This way.

228
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,960
This way.

229
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,720
This old man is really in the middle.

230
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,680
He's really in the middle.

231
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,040
He can go up and open the door.

232
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,600
Yes, yes, yes.

233
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
The yellow one is in the middle.

234
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,440
He's so strange.

235
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,840
He can't beat him.

236
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
My god.

237
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,600
He didn't go back.

238
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,200
He started to fight.

239
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
He went back and saw the yellow one.

240
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,960
He's chasing.

241
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,600
He's here.

242
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:08,720
He's here.

243
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,800
He's 20 meters behind.

244
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,720
Can we go?

245
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,080
Don't chase him so deep.

246
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,640
Now, you're the one who's chasing,

247
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,520
the one who's protecting.

248
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,120
The one who's chasing,

249
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,960
the one who's chasing.

250
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,640
Now, I'm going to send you back home.

251
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm going to get you out of the grass.

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
You're going to kill them all.

253
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,400
You're going to kill them all.

254
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
This is too hard to do.

255
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,640
We're going to kill them all.

256
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,040
Are we going to kill them all?

257
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,440
We're going to kill them all.

258
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
We've killed Smiling for two or three times.

259
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,680
It seems that the main road is very difficult.

260
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,720
And if we do this next time,

261
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,440
we can't get rid of Smiling.

262
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
Yes, yes.

263
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,520
What's going on?

264
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,880
Did he get the most Fnatic's jungle?

265
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
What's the trick?

266
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,600
I hope Tong Yao can stay calm.

267
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,360
Maybe he must be in a hurry.

268
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,160
Shut up.

269
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
We can see that

270
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,440
the enemy is coming to the ZGDX's bot lane.

271
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,280
Now, it's time for Smiling

272
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,920
to take the wave to the tower.

273
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,960
I'm so slow.

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,440
This is unnecessary.

275
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
We don't even want our own jungle.

276
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,920
Either we can get into the pit,

277
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,360
or we can get into the pit.

278
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,520
Look, the enemy is coming.

279
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,320
Smiling is getting into the pit again.

280
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,640
Smiling is so hard to get rid of.

281
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,520
I...

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,240
I'm done.

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
The map of the game

284
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,280
was cut in two parts.

285
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,800
It's just the middle.

286
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,680
He's not even playing.

287
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,640
He's just in the middle.

288
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
It's urgent, Miss.

289
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
We still have time.

290
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,240
Come on.

291
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,440
Miss, you finally said it.

292
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,040
I thought someone was coming back.

293
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Someone?

294
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,840
I'm not a mute, right?

295
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,640
I'm going to the tower to make a mistake.

296
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm a little busy.

297
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,000
Be careful, Fang Yu.

298
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,800
It seems that today's Smiling

299
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,320
is about to have a winner.

300
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,480
We see that he's already

301
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,080
in the tower to take the wave.

302
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,440
The enemy is coming.

303
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,000
The tower is coming.

304
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,080
You know what, Smiling?

305
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,000
What's going on?

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,480
Let's change the camp to the tower.

307
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600
Let's change the camp.

308
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,400
Are you crazy?

309
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,200
You're out of energy.

310
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
The tower is coming.

311
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's change the camp.

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,720
What's the hell is my jungle?

313
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,360
Why didn't you move the mouse just now?

314
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,400
If he comes out again,

315
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,320
I'll throw it at you.

316
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,200
Old man, you're so...

317
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,720
Old man, you can't hold it.

318
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,040
You've lost a tower.

319
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't want to fall down.

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,400
The enemy is going to be the double line.

321
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,920
I can't get out of the tower.

322
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,360
Look, I said he has to know.

323
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,920
It's all your fault.

324
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,720
Yes, it's my fault.

325
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,920
It's not a success.

326
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,600
You're so stupid.

327
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,240
You're so stupid.

328
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,400
You're so stupid.

329
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,120
You're so stupid.

330
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
You...

331
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Go.

332
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,920
The tower is coming.

333
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,320
Let the battle start and fight.

334
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,880
You will have to play one game at a time.

335
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,520
You will have to play as long as your Little Kun can görüş.

336
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,960
Just relax.

337
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Okay, now we see

338
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,400
the front team fighting.

339
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,080
Now you've both been threatened by group Chechong

340
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,840
by the mediocre.

341
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,920
But you have always

342
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,760
planned out the threat to the enemy.

343
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
And he's been chased.

344
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,160
He's decapitated.

345
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,200
I had this worked out.

346
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,440
I did it.

347
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,360
Don't play with Chechong.

348
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,680
It took me full 3 hours to become the Leopard.

349
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,320
I've captured half of the headline.

350
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,880
!

351
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,240
Anotherang, you dare to be a zebra like this?

352
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,940
Here is the obstacle

353
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,540
the edit member in the game

354
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,100
has removed the culpa

355
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,620
Snowflake tonight

356
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,560
ice cream is caring

357
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,060
Why did he have to skip instructions?

358
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,700
Don't worry

359
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,120
We're gonna win

360
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,320
Have to finish like this

361
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,780
The best ice cream

362
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,460
Now got the best

363
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,280
One-劳

364
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,860
One-劳

365
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,220
The result is

366
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,260
Congratulations!

367
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
Congratulations!

368
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
Yes!

369
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,260
Congratulations to the three teams

370
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
who won the game today.

371
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,260
Congratulations!

372
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Miss,

373
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,260
don't be depressed.

374
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,260
I only have full fire.

375
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Do you understand?

376
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
I'm sorry.

377
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,220
When are you going to meet

378
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,260
your girlfriend?

379
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Come and discuss the next game.

380
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,260
Hello.

381
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Miss,

382
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,260
can you be my fan?

383
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Is everyone your partner?

384
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Oh.

385
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Hello, everyone.

386
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm the Smiling of GGDX.

387
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Miss,

388
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
we look good together.

389
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Right?

390
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
Isn't it cute?

391
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
Hello.

392
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,340
What are you doing?

393
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
Don't do live broadcast here.

394
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
Can I add your name?

395
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,340
Give me a WeChat.

396
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,340
Can I have a look?

397
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
Yes.

398
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
I'll look for you.

399
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Thank you, Miss.

400
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
You're so cute.

401
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
What's going on?

402
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
I'm still in the game.

403
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,340
What do you mean?

404
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,340
She has our WeChat.

405
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Don't listen to her.

406
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Ke'er, come here.

407
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,340
Let's summarize the problem of the last game.

408
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,340
It's better to go back to the next game.

409
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,340
Welcome back.

410
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,340
The game is now in the final.

411
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
This game is very miserable.

412
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,380
If you play the next game, you'll be in the game.

413
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,380
You've already made three people in the game.

414
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Yes.

415
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
You can say that you're the best.

416
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
You have to be careful.

417
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,380
You have to be careful.

418
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
The game is over.

419
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
This game is changed to the game.

420
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
It's a game that has been played.

421
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
But the game is not good.

422
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
It's a game that has been played.

423
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Yes.

424
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,380
Let's look at the game.

425
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,380
The two teams are pushed down.

426
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,380
The middle team is in the game.

427
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
Be careful.

428
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,380
The other team is in the game.

429
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,380
The game is over.

430
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,380
I'll go catch Tong Yang.

431
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,380
The economy is good.

432
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
Now it's basically down.

433
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
Where are you going?

434
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,380
Brother Cheng doesn't want me anymore?

435
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
Take him away.

436
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
My god.

437
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Qian Shi has expressed his feelings quickly.

438
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
This is really a game that has been played.

439
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
It's a game that has been played.

440
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Xiao Meng followed me.

441
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Here we go.

442
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
Go back to the game.

443
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
The middle team seems to have been in the game.

444
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
The back side is open.

445
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
The game is very difficult today.

446
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
If this game wins,

447
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,420
there will be a better game.

448
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
Go up.

449
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
The game is very difficult.

450
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
Here we go.

451
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
Here we go.

452
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
The game is also for protecting the middle team.

453
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
The whole system is not fit for this game.

454
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
What is this?

455
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,420
The middle team is very stupid.

456
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
They are going to take the middle team away.

457
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,420
The middle team is also gone.

458
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
Go.

459
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
I understand.

460
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,460
Come on.

461
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
We can't go to the middle team now.

462
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Let's see if there is anyone who can't defend.

463
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,460
I found out that these two teams have been defeated.

464
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
Actually, as long as ZGDX is against their ZGDX,

465
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
they can't defend the middle team.

466
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,460
But the team is basically not going to defend.

467
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
What do we think about the middle team?

468
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
The middle team has been defeated.

469
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Do you have a chance?

470
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,460
But that team hasn't been able to defend.

471
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,460
Take him away.

472
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Come on.

473
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,460
Go.

474
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Go.

475
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Congratulations to ZGDX

476
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
for winning the final round of the final round.

477
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Congratulations.

478
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Congratulations.

479
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
You are amazing, Chen He.

480
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
After the final round,

481
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
I feel like I'm three years old.

482
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Go.

483
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Go, take the small team.

484
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Go.

485
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Smiling.

486
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm happy to meet you.

487
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Miss, you are so cute.

488
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I'm also cute.

489
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Let's go.

490
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
We are just eating.

491
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
We are so hungry.

492
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
So hungry.

493
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
He is so happy.

494
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Go.

495
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Hua said that you are not hungry.

496
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Brother.

497
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Brother, let's eat together.

498
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
Let's eat together.

499
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,540
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

500
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
Let's eat together.

501
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,540
Is that okay?

502
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,540
He is always so enthusiastic.

503
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
You may have some misunderstanding about enthusiasm.

504
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
He is called a loser.

505
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
Let's go.

506
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Let's go.

507
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
Go.

508
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
Okay.

509
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Brother, where is Miss?

510
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Miss!

511
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,680
What the hell!

512
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,600
How did she come to our car?

513
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,580
Jiyou is beautiful.

514
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
together.

515
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,900
Let's create a pretty�� telef Jes ist mit mir so du G

516
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,820
why don't you sit here

517
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,540
OK

518
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,900
tight

519
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,220
look

520
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,540
So sharp

521
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,660
you can hug me

522
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,300
10

523
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,100
Ten

524
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100
sitting

525
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,660
I sit

526
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
Master Su, why don't you sit on the fanatic chair?

527
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
I don't...

528
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
What's wrong?

529
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
I have an idea.

530
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
I don't know whether to be the leader or not.

531
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
No leader.

532
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,660
I think the fanatic team's aunt wants to trick me.

533
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
You think so too?

534
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,660
I think you should be the leader.

535
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
I think you should be the leader.

536
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,660
I think you should be the leader.

537
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,660
I think you should be the leader.

538
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
You think so?

539
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,660
I just want to put it in the coffin with Wan Nian Zhu.

540
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Then I'll keep it as a secret.

541
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
I'll keep it as a secret.

542
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
What's wrong?

543
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,660
What's wrong with you?

544
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,660
I'm sorry.

545
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
I'm sorry about you?

546
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,660
What did he say?

547
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
What did you say again?

548
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
He said sorry to you.

549
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
What did you say to him?

550
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
He said sorry to me.

551
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
Are you a cheat?

552
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
Please translate it for me.

553
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,660
Don't bother.

554
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Anyway, he won't look for you from now on.

555
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,660
Yan Yu, I want to talk to you.

556
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
Tell me.

557
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
Are you serious?

558
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
Yes.

559
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,660
The leader of your team is really your girlfriend now?

560
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Yes.

561
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
That's fast.

562
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
She doesn't seem to believe me.

563
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
I told you.

564
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,660
Can you be my proof?

565
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
Yes.

566
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,660
I'm sorry.

567
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,660
Even if it's not now, it will be like that.

568
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,660
You have to regret it.

569
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,660
You're already my girlfriend.

570
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,660
What's the difference?

571
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,660
If you're not my girlfriend,

572
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,660
do you think that's a success?

573
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
Don't get mad.

574
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
If you say that you're in a team,

575
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,660
you don't have to do that.

576
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,660
Dong Hyun is so cute.

577
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
I want to protect him.

578
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
Shut up, you bastard.

579
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,660
You're my girlfriend even if you're cute.

580
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,660
And if you were in Korea,

581
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,660
you said you were in a team.

582
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,660
Do you know what I'm talking about?

583
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,660
That bastard said that every time he drinks.

584
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,660
He said that he changes every day.

585
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,660
That's different.

586
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
That's different.

587
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
If you stay with Dong Hyun,

588
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
I'll show you on Instagram.

589
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,660
All Korean fans will know.

590
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,660
Everyone is so impressed by me.

591
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
How can I be so impressed?

592
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,660
I'll ask you to ask Jang In-heon.

593
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
No matter what, you can't do that.

594
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
You can't.

595
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
You're a bastard.

596
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
Hey,

597
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
don't you believe that you're in front of me?

598
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,660
You were so cute when you were playing the game.

599
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
Everyone in the game

600
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,660
will give you a smiley face.

601
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Hey,

602
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,660
please allow me.

603
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
I feel like I've met her.

604
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
She's so good.

605
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,660
She likes a guy like Dong Hyun.

606
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
What should I do?

607
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
What should I do?

608
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
I'm going to win.

609
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,660
I'll do it.

610
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,660
Or I'll hit the girl in front of her.

611
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,660
You said that I'm a good girl.

612
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,660
So happy.

613
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,660
You're here.

614
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
It's so good.

615
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
Why are you two here?

616
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,660
The meat is cooked.

617
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Don't have a meeting later.

618
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
Eat it.

619
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
The meat is cooked.

620
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
That's because of the guests.

621
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
Brother Cheng,

622
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,660
why are you two here?

623
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
You're not afraid of others, are you?

624
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,660
I'm not afraid of him.

625
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,660
You're a pervert.

626
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,660
You're a pervert.

627
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,660
Brother Cheng is usually not that fierce.

628
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
Eat more.

629
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
Don't be nervous.

630
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
You talk so much.

631
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Eat your own food.

632
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
You're so good.

633
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Let's go.

634
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,660
Why are you here?

635
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,660
This is our base.

636
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
What do you mean?

637
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,660
Aijia has been doing well recently.

638
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
I've pulled her out of the intern list.

639
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,660
And she's been chasing me for several places.

640
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,660
She even told me about her life, her plans and so on.

641
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,660
I think it makes sense.

642
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,660
So I decided to give her another chance.

643
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
Since I decided to start over,

644
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,660
I think my grandma is too suitable for that.

645
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,660
So I found this place.

646
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,660
So you and Aijia are good friends.

647
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,660
And you're in the five-star hotel

648
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,660
in the surrounding area.

649
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,660
You're really good friends.

650
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,660
Because of love,

651
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
why don't you move over?

652
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
No, I'm not.

653
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
I'm not a good friend.

654
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,660
No, I'd rather live in the hotel.

655
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,660
You're rich.

656
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
I don't deserve to have a partner.

657
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
What do you mean?

658
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Aijia, you deserve to have a partner.

659
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,660
Besides, I can live near you.

660
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,660
I can help you, right?

661
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Help me?

662
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,660
By the way, I have something to ask you.

663
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,660
Come here.

664
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
Come on.

665
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Help me translate it.

666
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,660
What is this?

667
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,660
What is this?

668
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
What is this?

669
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,660
What is this?

670
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,660
What is this?

671
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,660
What is this?

672
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,660
What is this?

673
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,660
What is this?

674
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
What is this?

675
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
Translate it.

676
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
She's my girlfriend.

677
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
Don't touch her.

678
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660
You little brat.

679
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,660
You're so idle.

680
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
Do you have time to read the script?

681
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
No way.

682
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,660
Is this Brother Cheng's voice?

683
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,660
What is this?

684
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,660
I told you you were laughing at me.

685
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660
Add it.

686
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,660
I bought the tickets for you.

687
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,660
So,

688
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,660
let's have dinner after the match.

689
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,660
What's wrong with that girl?

690
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,660
Which girl?

691
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,660
Su Luo.

692
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,660
You're not a blind date, are you?

693
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,660
Why did you appear in the drama?

694
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,660
She's quite good at acting.

695
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,660
She's good at acting.

696
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
She's also good at personality.

697
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,660
She's a good actress.

698
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,660
She's a good actress.

699
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,660
She's a good actress.

700
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,660
She's a good actress.

701
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,660
She's a good actress.

702
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,660
She's a good actress.

703
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,660
She's good at personality.

704
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,660
She's good at family matters.

705
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,660
She's a good actress.

706
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,660
She's a good actress.

707
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
When I say the third time,

708
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,660
you're lying on the ground.

709
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
Give me another chance.

710
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Why did you appear in the drama?

711
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,660
The queen told me

712
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,660
that you were not in a good mood

713
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,660
when you got married.

714
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
But after she went home,

715
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,660
she thought about it for a few days.

716
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,660
She wanted to try your threat.

717
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,660
The queen said that you wouldn't agree.

718
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,660
So she called me...

719
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,660
Let me explain.

720
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,660
I was threatened.

721
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,660
She said that if I didn't listen to her,

722
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,660
I would go back to help you get married.

723
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,660
And I would get married.

724
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Bro, I thought about it all night.

725
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
I told you that you were my girlfriend,

726
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,660
but I don't believe it.

727
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
I'm going to watch the game on the weekend.

728
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
If you're my girlfriend,

729
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
you'll know what I'm going to do.

730
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,660
If you're my girlfriend,

731
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
I'm going to give up.

732
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
But if you don't,

733
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
I'm not going to give up.

734
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
I love you so much.

735
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,660
Do whatever you want.

736
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Bro, I'm so ashamed of you.

737
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,660
What did you say to her in the car that day?

738
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,660
You don't have to be a peach flower for me.

739
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,660
You're a great peach flower.

740
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
You can give me another one.

741
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
I'll give it to you.

742
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,660
What's that?

743
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
You're wrong.

744
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Can you explain it to me?

745
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
My brother is actually dead.

746
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,660
Something terrible happened between you two.

747
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,660
Right?

748
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
Go back and practice your body language.

749
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,660
Why are you hitting my number again?

750
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Let's play.

751
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Miss, come on.

752
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
You go.

753
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Let's play.

754
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
Are you a computer dead or bad?

755
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
I know.

756
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
You're looking at my cat ears.

757
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,660
What?

758
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Where is it?

759
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
You're looking at my cat ears.

760
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
No, it's not.

761
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
It's a man's name.

762
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Let's go.

763
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Come on, boss.

764
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Okay, come on.

765
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
Come on.

766
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
What's that?

767
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
It's a honeycomb.

768
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
Do you want one?

769
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
No.

770
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,660
It's much better.

771
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
You want to play with the plum?

772
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
I'll play with your plum.

773
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,660
What's the use of this?

774
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
It's not water.

775
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
Come on.

776
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Is your temperament okay?

777
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,660
What?

778
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
You're not feeling well?

779
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
We're going to meet up.

780
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,660
It's not far away.

781
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
You can dream.

782
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,660
You're going to dream.

783
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,660
You're going to dream.

784
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
You're going to dream.

785
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
You're going to dream.

786
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,660
Wait.

787
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Hangseo.

788
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Hangseo.

789
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
What a jerk.

790
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
Oh, fuck.

791
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
What?

792
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
What's wrong?

793
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
Someone's looking at me.

794
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
There's no one here.

795
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
I guess there's a ghost.

796
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,660
Good bye.

797
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Take a rest.

798
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,660
Let's see you at the stadium.

799
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Luckily, he was faster.

800
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
He almost found me.

801
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
I'm sorry.

802
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,660
I'm sorry.

803
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,660
I'm sorry.

804
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,660
I'm sorry.

805
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,660
I'm sorry.

806
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,660
I'm sorry.

807
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,660
I'm sorry.

808
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,660
I'm sorry.

809
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,660
I'm sorry.

810
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
I'm sorry.

811
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
I'm sorry.

812
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
I'm sorry.

813
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
I'm sorry.

814
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,660
I'm sorry.

815
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
I'm sorry.

816
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
I'm sorry.

817
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
I'm sorry.

818
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,660
I'm sorry.

819
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
I'm sorry.

820
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
I'm sorry.

821
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
I'm sorry.

822
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,660
I'm sorry.

823
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
I'm sorry.

824
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,660
I'm sorry.

825
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
I'm sorry.

826
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,660
I'm sorry.

827
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
I'm sorry.

828
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
I'm sorry.

829
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,660
She should be here.

830
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Yes, her life started earlier than before.

831
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
The game starts after today.

832
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,660
She's executed with such aちょっと防 Но.

833
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
You couldn't hear me for long.

834
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
It's okay.

835
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Don't be so nonsense.

836
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
You put so much effort on changing.

837
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Of course.

838
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Your mountain passes from憑

839
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,660
prepared.

840
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,660
I saw you far away from my parents.

841
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
No, it's a pity to throw it away.

842
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,260
Why don't you eat it?

843
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:21,900
Okay.

844
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,860
Today's competition,

845
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,060
Li Hengshuo will come.

846
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,980
Who?

847
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:41,900
Kun.

848
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,300
Why is he here?

849
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,100
Not so confident.

850
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,620
I want to see if we're really together.

851
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,740
If he finds out that he's not a real person,

852
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,540
you'll be his 18th son.

853
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,020
18th?

854
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,500
But he looks like a good boy.

855
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,220
You said it looks like him.

856
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,220
He was changed to a girl in Korea earlier,

857
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,700
but he's even faster than a girl in Korean.

858
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,420
That's because he never found a girl

859
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,900
with his own eyes.

860
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,540
So he never found her.

861
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,220
Why do you know him so well?

862
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,940
Because when I was in the Korean TIT team,

863
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,180
he was already a trainee in the TIT team.

864
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,820
So I didn't look like the one in the media.

865
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,420
I was the one who joined the team.

866
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,620
So I'm his senior.

867
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,860
That's exactly why

868
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,940
I can't let him go because of me.

869
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,340
That's what I said before.

870
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,420
Before you make such a terrible excuse,

871
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,940
can you say hi first?

872
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,380
Just your little boldness.

873
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,620
Is it useful to say hi to you?

874
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,940
After saying hi, I came to grab my phone

875
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,100
and then he kept calling me.

876
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,900
Then Chen Lun became 18th.

877
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,060
I see.

878
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,700
Don't say that.

879
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
But he's really good.

880
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,900
Thanks.

881
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,180
Thank you.

882
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,140
Hello, guys.

883
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,560
Welcome back to DSุ

884
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Welcome to the live broadcast of 2020 OTL Championship.

885
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,560
The participants are the VGDS and Blue Team.

886
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,560
We are looking forward to the match.

887
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,560
Look at the big rose.

888
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Smile!

889
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Is that your trust partner, Brother Cheng?

890
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Forget it.

891
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:46,580
Choose 199 mane

892
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,420
Good.

893
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,140
Did you see that?

894
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,860
I saw it.

895
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,100
It's Brother Cheng's hand.

896
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,860
It's like live streaming.

897
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,260
I think they're good.

898
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,100
I knew they're bad.

899
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,740
Right?

900
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,180
If you dare to act with them again,

901
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,740
I'll be his face next time.

902
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,700
I'll be able to wake him up.

903
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,500
No, I didn't.

904
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,940
You're blind.

905
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,060
I know.

906
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,300
Put your head away.

907
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,100
No.

908
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,260
He's still looking at me.

909
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,780
You're talking nonsense again.

910
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,740
The competition is about to start.

911
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,940
Is that appropriate?

912
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,420
Some people are too arrogant.

913
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,460
They want to win the 10,000-year-old.

914
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,900
I asked him if he wanted to see the sun.

915
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,900
But I didn't say.

916
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,500
Brother Cheng.

917
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,340
What?

918
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,940
You're doing this.

919
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,220
Can't you be jealous of your blind date?

920
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,940
No.

921
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,100
I've already rejected him.

922
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,140
But he said he didn't want to try.

923
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,740
He doesn't even know what a powerhouse is.

924
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,820
What's so good about it?

925
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,500
He's looking for a boyfriend.

926
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,660
He's looking for a job.

927
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,500
Why would he know what a powerhouse is?

928
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Because I'm a person.

929
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,260
Okay. The competition is about to start.

930
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,580
Let's have a round of applause.

931
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,020
Come on.

932
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,940
Let's have a look.

933
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,020
I'm going to be a good girl.

934
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,220
I'm going to be a good girl.

935
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,420
I'm going to be a good girl.

936
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,780
I'm going to be a good girl.

937
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,940
I'm going to be a good girl.

938
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,140
I'm going to be a good girl.

939
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,460
I'm going to be a good girl.

940
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,660
