1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What's the point of being successful in the game?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,800
We didn't even go to the finals because of someone.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,800
We even won the prize.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,600
The injury on the god's hand was so serious.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Who did it?

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,800
Not all the mistakes can be revealed by time.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Lu Yue will definitely not be the first one to make a mistake.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,600
Anyway, this thing

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,200
must be done by us.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,200
I made the video.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
Fatty.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Why are you fighting?

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,000
Why did you drag the god away?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
Why did you even join the whole team?

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,200
You will always be a coward who will escape.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Say it again!

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
What's wrong with you?

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,600
Stop fighting!

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Stop fighting!

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,000
What's wrong with you?

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Fatty, you made a mistake.

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Lu Yue didn't mean to fight with others.

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
Lu Yue made a mistake.

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Why do you keep protecting him?

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,800
The truth of the matter is never on the surface.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,800
Do you want to hear it?

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,800
What happened a year ago?

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Hello, sister. I know...

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Yao, don't hang up.

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Go watch Jia's live broadcast.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
He is now in the scene of Lu Yue's death.

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
It's a coincidence.

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I was just in the toilet at that time.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
I was just in the toilet.

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I was just in the toilet.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Did you know how much money the members of the JK team had?

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
ZZDX gave me a stone-shaped key.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I was so happy.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
I was so happy.

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I was so happy.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I was so happy.

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
What's the point?

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I was so happy to be the one who was so happy.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
You are so arrogant.

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Yes.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Especially Lu Yue.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
His brother didn't come to the party tonight.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
But he dared to call Xiao here.

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
He didn't give us a face to cry.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,800
He spent so much money to promote the game.

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
But he even gave us a 2-2 win.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Didn't he say that the game is over?

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
The big brother is done.

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
He didn't give us a face to cry.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
He even made a high-quality play.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
He is so arrogant.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
If he didn't say it again,

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
if our brother wasn't in a good condition today,

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
he wouldn't lose to them.

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Yes.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
They are just the finalists of the game.

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
They are so arrogant.

63
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Exactly.

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Want to go to the national finalists?

65
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Don't do that.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Don't give me a face.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I want them to know what they can't eat.

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
They are all ugly.

69
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Hello.

70
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
You are here.

71
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Yes.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Take a few more people.

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Give me the hands of the few people

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
who didn't get on the ZGDX.

75
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
They are all gone.

76
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Well.

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Be careful when you are doing it.

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Don't hurt Mr. Lu's 2nd master.

79
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Well, Gao.

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Why don't you break the hand of the guy who made the new road?

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,800
The people from Lu's family are in trouble.

82
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
The fight is about

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,800
the first-ever swordsman from A-Ga.

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
He wanted to find someone

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
to break the hand of the professional player.

86
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Who is the professional player?

87
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
It's ZGDX.

88
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Brothers.

89
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
They want to find someone

90
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
to break the hand of the ZGDX team member.

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
And they are not kidding.

92
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
They called someone at that time.

93
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
If it's you,

94
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
you will be in trouble.

95
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Can you solve it?

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
And if they really call someone,

97
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
everything will be solved.

98
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Yes.

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
This is the whole thing.

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I just want to try it.

101
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Everyone, take your time.

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Bye.

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Lu Yue.

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Since we are all brothers in a team,

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
in order to protect us from the fight,

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,800
you shouldn't hide your heart from them from the start.

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
He didn't say anything wrong.

108
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Your hand

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
is not a weapon.

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
You can't hide your heart from them.

111
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
You can't hide your heart from them.

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
You can't hide your heart from them.

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Your hand is still hurt because of me.

114
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Lu Yue.

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Alright.

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
We have made it clear.

117
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Then, don't let go of the past anymore.

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
But your hand is hurt.

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I have my responsibility.

120
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
So, even if I say it,

121
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I can't change anything.

122
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
What Xiaobao said is right.

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
I really depend on you.

124
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I depend on the team.

125
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
No matter what,

126
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
this is really Lu Yue's fault.

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
It seems like

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
he can't blame all the mistakes on Lu Yue's head.

129
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
It's just a misunderstanding.

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
It's better to blame the one who is too close to the team.

131
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Yes.

132
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
If you were me,

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
if someone heard it,

134
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I would be the one to blame.

135
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Right?

136
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
So, this whole thing

137
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
can't be blamed on Lu Yue's head.

138
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
How can you think like that?

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
You should find the police.

140
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes.

141
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
You must tell him that he can't blame himself.

142
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
It's all clear now.

143
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Okay.

144
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Xiaobao.

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Are you okay?

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Lu Yue.

147
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
It's my fault.

149
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I misunderstood you.

150
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
It's okay.

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Brother Cheng.

152
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I think we should

153
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
reveal the truth first.

154
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
It's not a complete twist.

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
But at least we should let people know

156
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
that it's not our fault.

157
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
I'll call the police.

158
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
How can I solve it?

159
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Lu Yue.

160
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I don't think it's wrong.

162
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
I really think

163
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
the most差 thing is to solve it.

164
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Lu Yue, you're right.

165
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
You should contact me

166
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
in such a situation.

167
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
If I were there,

168
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I wouldn't be hurt

169
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
if I didn't get my hands on it.

170
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
If you call me,

171
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I'll go there.

172
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
I don't have to...

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I'll call the police.

174
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Right?

175
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Okay.

176
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I'm fine.

177
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Brother Cheng is here.

178
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I finally got to know

179
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
the live stream of ZGDX.

180
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm so curious.

181
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm dead.

182
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Can you explain

183
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
the fight?

184
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Why did Lu Yue get his hands on it?

185
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
It's indeed Lu Yue's hand.

186
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
As for why,

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
you can watch the live stream.

188
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
You're the one who got the hands on it.

189
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
That's why you're leaving.

190
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
It's because of this fight.

191
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
For the sake of God's safety.

192
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm sorry.

198
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
The wound of the famous doctor's hand is an accident.

200
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
That's right.

201
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
It does have something to do with this.

202
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
But the wound of the famous doctor's hand

203
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
is also injured.

204
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
It's a common thing

205
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
to fight with professional players.

206
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
The experience is private.

207
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
It's normal to fight with four people.

208
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
No matter what,

209
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Lu Yue is the one who got the hands on it.

210
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Brother Cheng,

211
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
if it were you,

212
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
what would you do?

213
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
I won't go up to hit people.

214
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
But I'll let those who bully me

215
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
know

216
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
how to regret it twice.

217
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Look.

218
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
We're a contract contract.

219
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
You're so lazy.

220
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Why don't you go and

221
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
expand your time?

222
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Are you going to

223
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
give it to a fixed position?

224
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
You can always

225
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
force this stupid computer.

226
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Right, Secretary?

227
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
That's enough to say

228
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
that I'm in a good position with you.

229
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I'm talking about adding

230
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
a computer table to you.

231
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Fatty has been in the kitchen

232
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
since morning.

233
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Is it now?

234
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm afraid she's going to do something big.

235
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I don't think so.

236
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
She's just

237
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
making dinner

238
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
for everyone.

239
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm hungry.

240
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm hungry.

241
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
No way.

242
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,040
Yo,

243
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,100
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,800
Just go back to sleep.

245
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Let's leave.

246
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Xiaopang,

247
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I'm not sure

248
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
but you stillplanet

249
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I have

250
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,300
paid such a long平

251
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,800
the same price as the last time.

252
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,120
What do you want? I'll get it for you.

253
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,920
No need. You guys sit down.

254
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Brother Rui,

255
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,280
I heard that you've spent three months on this project.

256
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,640
It's so terrible.

257
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,760
That means that he's spending three months

258
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,000
on this project.

259
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,640
Can I choose not to eat this white rice?

260
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,360
I don't want to eat it.

261
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,240
You want to talk about Feng Lianhua?

262
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,120
Feng Lianhua?

263
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,560
I'll eat it.

264
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,560
I'll eat it.

265
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,720
I'm a good cook.

266
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,520
I deserve this.

267
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,080
Fatty,

268
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,160
even though you're being paid for,

269
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,400
you're a guest.

270
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,480
You should at least eat more meat.

271
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
You have nothing to eat.

272
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes.

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
Why don't you have any meat?

274
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,720
You two don't eat. Give it to me.

275
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,320
No, no, no.

276
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Eat.

277
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Eat.

278
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
I'll find more.

279
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,200
Here's what I said.

280
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
Do you have meat?

281
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
A little.

282
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
What are you doing?

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,520
No, Fatty.

284
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,720
You're giving yourself a hard time

285
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,400
and you're hiding the meat from the kids.

286
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,880
I thought I wouldn't be popular

287
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,440
at that age.

288
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,440
Look, you're angry, right?

289
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Look at him.

290
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,060
Little Are you Mode

291
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,680
Lu Yue, I was wrong.

292
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,180
I shouldn't have made it clear

293
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,240
and wear the wedding seal.

294
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,340
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,860
Prevention Leave

296
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,400
How could my room be spoiled by Xiaopeng earlier?

297
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,000
That's enough.

298
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,640
The hospital is due.

299
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,520
Did we don't notice the record of the mistake?

300
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,240
No.

301
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,040
Then I'll fill out the

302
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,680
market stakeings tomorrow.

303
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,440
What?

304
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,760
Why don't you notice?

305
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,760
Why don't we notice?

306
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,880
I have both Walnut and Walnut.

307
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,600
I have only one point.

308
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,400
All new members

309
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,080
are planning to start them from July 31.

310
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,240
Are you kidding?

311
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,640
I didn't hit the job. Don't lie to me.

312
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,760
You're right.

313
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,040
When I was about to hit the job,

314
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,440
I was also giving the job to someone else.

315
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,720
But I only took one year to

316
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,800
press the person on the T-shirt to color-pick the hair.

317
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,240
Listen up.

318
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,240
That person doesn't have a color-pick hair.

319
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,880
If I color-pick the hair,

320
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,240
that's impossible.

321
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,640
Shut up.

322
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,760
Who is the one who is trying to color-pick the hair?

323
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,840
Jiang Hua.

324
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,200
Jiao Huang?

325
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,680
The one who is a professional?

326
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,200
My brother and Jiao Huang used to be a professional.

327
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,080
The strongest official in the history of OCK.

328
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,000
Zhi Wan.

329
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,520
Do you want to convince me or do you want to do something?

330
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,960
To tell you,

331
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
everything will be lighted up in the world.

332
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,960
Look at Brother Cheng and Jiao Huang.

333
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,600
Right?

334
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
They are respected by the same people.

335
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
They are all in the same team.

336
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
All these two people

337
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,140
have to color-pick the hair under their

338
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,840
model.

339
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,640
They are all in the same team.

340
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,240
I don't want to.

341
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Talk to me.

342
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,640
Say it again.

343
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
I don't want to.

344
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
He doesn't want to talk.

345
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
What?

346
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Your brother is going to ride my head.

347
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,240
Who asked you to be so late?

348
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,840
And he doesn't know how much time he has left.

349
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,040
Be honest.

350
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,040
Why are you helping him?

351
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,840
You can't control him.

352
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,440
Did you hear that?

353
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,040
I will be the first to arrive.

354
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
I will be the second to arrive.

355
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,640
You will be the first to arrive.

356
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Don't be so soft.

357
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
You two didn't participate in the official competition.

358
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,440
It's normal for you to be kicked by a substitute.

359
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
You two want to be in the first place.

360
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,240
You should fight with your strength.

361
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,440
Great.

362
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I respect Brother Cheng's experience.

363
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Let me tell you.

364
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,040
This is the most perfect match I've ever seen.

365
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,040
Really.

366
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:33,840
4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 2, 3.

367
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Brother Cheng.

368
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
As the captain, you have to be a good boy.

369
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,640
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

370
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
I'm 1.5.

371
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,040
From here, I can see the other team is watching the Korean drama.

372
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,240
I can't believe I have such a good strength.

373
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Do I need to do it?

374
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,240
6, 7, 8, 7, 2, 3.

375
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
When I'm not around,

376
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,040
the ZG TV is really a big mess.

377
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,440
A family is really a miracle.

378
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,040
Is this the new computer that the club gave you?

379
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,640
Yes.

380
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,440
The club has always been the best for me.

381
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,040
What generation is this?

382
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,440
You are still doing the security check?

383
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,240
I bought you a protective light.

384
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,840
In the future, no matter how long the computer is,

385
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,640
you don't have to worry about the pain in your eyes.

386
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,440
Everyone has it.

387
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Everyone needs it.

388
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
You think it's pretty good.

389
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Of course.

390
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
You fool.

391
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
You...

392
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Come over here.

393
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
Captain, you come over here.

394
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Captain, you come over here.

395
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,560
When you practice,

396
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,320
I will be good at it.

397
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,440
I will be good at it when you practice.

398
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Why are you about to tell me?

399
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,320
Why are you.

400
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
T Dip Lee Min,

401
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,120
How's your play?"

402
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,620
That was exactly the phrase.

403
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,580
How is he?

404
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,980
Looks like you're still in good health.

405
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,460
I've pulled him into the intern's man's list.

406
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,420
Let's see his performance.

407
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,140
You've been together for six years.

408
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,940
He's been in the intern's list for six times.

409
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,260
He's never been fired.

410
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,060
Shut up.

411
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,900
The new season of the fashion show

412
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,780
and the formation show are here.

413
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,660
Take a look.

414
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,180
I'm here to see you.

415
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,420
What?

416
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
The national team is going to take the formation photo?

417
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,380
The national team?

418
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,420
You're going to host the national team?

419
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,580
Sister.

420
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,260
You should know your position a little bit.

421
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,060
I just want to be beautiful.

422
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,300
You don't need to know this.

423
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,540
Your fans have decided to host you.

424
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,820
Why are you angry?

425
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,980
Because Lu Yue is here.

426
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,700
Our team hasn't decided the name of the cook yet.

427
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,060
It must be yours.

428
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,300
My sister is not that good.

429
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,540
It's not necessarily.

430
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,620
Cheng Ge said he'd drink a bowl of water.

431
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,580
I was worried

432
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,540
how to get this bowl of water

433
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,180
from him.

434
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,660
Don't be ridiculous.

435
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,420
Girls should be confident about themselves.

436
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,340
Let's go.

437
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,580
I'll take you to the battle.

438
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,540
Battle?

439
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,940
What battle?

440
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,100
Our team has just chosen the right match.

441
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,860
It's different.

442
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,820
This battle is not a battle.

443
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,300
This...

444
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,940
This is what you said...

445
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,700
Go try it on.

446
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,540
A perfect girl

447
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,500
should have all her programs

448
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,420
in a Prophet-like manner

449
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,180
I'm national team will onlarge

450
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,420
not marriage tag.

451
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,980
I said thing like

452
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,780
your friend will take the photo shooting for you

453
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,820
for the first time tomorrow.

454
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,980
I hope

455
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,020
both of you will make the frame

456
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,180
show us your marriage interviews.

457
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,220
How much longer do you want?

458
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Sister,

459
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,420
I'm quite incredible.

460
00:21:51,020 --> 00:22:04,560
Come on, I could

461
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,800
dive each day.

462
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,900
What's the matter with you?

463
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,340
You look so eager!

464
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,060
Come on!

465
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,260
I'm not going to wear this.

466
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
I just like it.

467
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Okay then.

468
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Try these two.

469
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
No need to try.

470
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Okay.

471
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
Since you haven't decided who will be the first one to be sent out,

472
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,260
it's useless for you to send out your photo now.

473
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Anyway, you have to take a photo first.

474
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,260
You just have to tell your captain about your mental state.

475
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,260
You are his best shot.

476
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,260
By then, you will be able to take a photo of yourself.

477
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,260
You will be able to take a photo of yourself.

478
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
You will be able to take a photo of yourself.

479
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
By then, you and Brother Cheng's CP will be sent out.

480
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
You can also send out your own account.

481
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,260
The military department will be your first one.

482
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
Okay.

483
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,260
Are you going or not?

484
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Please.

485
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Let's go.

486
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,260
As a spa,

487
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
why are you like a rock on the board?

488
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,260
You are a rock on the board.

489
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Jin Yan,

490
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,260
you said that Lu Yue is back.

491
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Can't I just become a star and send out my photo?

492
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,260
You said this so many times today.

493
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,260
Look at it.

494
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,260
It's your photo.

495
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,260
It's not your photo.

496
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,260
It's useless.

497
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Can I?

498
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
Okay.

499
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
Jin Yan,

500
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,260
you said that Lu Yue is back.

501
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Can't I just become a star and send out my photo?

502
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
You said that so many times today.

503
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Jin Yan,

504
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,260
you said that can't I just become a star and send out my photo?

505
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,260
I'm going.

506
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Go.

507
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
Come on, Jin Yan.

508
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
Bye.

509
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
Look at them.

510
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,260
I don't understand what they are thinking.

511
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
I have to do it.

512
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Look at the other side's economy.

513
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,260
I'm going.

514
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
I'm going.

515
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
I'm going.

516
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,260
I'm going.

517
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
I'm going.

518
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
I'm going.

519
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,260
I'm going.

520
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
I'm going.

521
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
Darling!

522
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
Darling!

523
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
Darling!

524
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Darling!

525
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Darling!

526
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Why don't you come and see me?

527
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,260
Darling!

528
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Darling!

529
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
You're dressed up.

530
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,260
You're awake.

531
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,260
The water and the water are beside you.

532
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
There's no light.

533
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Lu Yue,

534
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
I advise you to be kind.

535
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
Why are you sitting in my position?

536
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,260
And you're eating my food?

537
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
Today is fat.

538
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,260
I can eat it and share it with you.

539
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,260
This is a healthy diet.

540
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
You know what?

541
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
Fattening.

542
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
Tong Yao.

543
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,260
Come out with me.

544
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
What's wrong, Brother Cheng?

545
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,260
Do you want some mangoes?

546
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
It's sweet.

547
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
What is this?

548
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,260
There are so many things in the family.

549
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
Why don't you touch the keyboard?

550
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
And

551
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,260
such a long hair.

552
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
You can't do it without hair.

553
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Such a strong perfume.

554
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
I want to kill my team.

555
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
And I can't even get a third one.

556
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
If you want to use your hands to do it,

557
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,260
just give me a good face.

558
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,260
Don't make useless things.

559
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,260
I caught the money rule.

560
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
I'm off.

561
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
I'm not...

562
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
How dare you take the money to revenge?

563
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
I'm not polite to you.

564
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
Brother Cheng, you've changed.

565
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Come on.

566
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,260
Yao Yao.

567
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I forgot to hang up with you.

568
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,260
Who did you meet the day before yesterday?

569
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
You met the ghost?

570
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
What ghost?

571
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
I met Su Shao Laosan.

572
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
He has been with our squad leader.

573
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,260
Such an ungrateful girl.

574
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,820
to our class monitor,

575
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,860
the red-hot one.

576
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,660
I feel like

577
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,060
her heart is about to burst.

578
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,860
Her heart is about to burst?

579
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,260
That's not a common thing.

580
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
Don't interrupt.

581
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Tong Yao.

582
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
What's wrong?

583
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,860
I'm wearing your fake and fake hair.

584
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,260
Are you being beaten up?

585
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,660
Brother Cheng doesn't agree.

586
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Sister.

587
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
I found out that

588
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
only Brother Cheng can crush you now.

589
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,260
Why did he pull Brother Cheng

590
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,860
on Brother Cheng?

591
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,260
In the last nine or eight hours,

592
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,860
your heart is about to burst.

593
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,460
Brother Cheng took you back.

594
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,660
The next day, you'll be back to your original state.

595
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
Tell me.

596
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,860
Did Brother Cheng do anything to you?

597
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,660
Tell me honestly.

598
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,860
Do you now

599
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,460
think that Brother Cheng

600
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,860
is just a heart-throbbing,

601
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
heart-throbbing,

602
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,060
and shameless?

603
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
Brother Cheng.

604
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
I'll give you a second.

605
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Answer me quickly.

606
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Answer me.

607
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
I'll just go back.

608
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,260
Do you like Brother Cheng?

609
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
What's this?

610
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Tell me.

611
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
Sister.

612
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,260
You're in love.

613
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Brother Cheng.

614
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Big bottle.

615
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Why didn't you close the door?

616
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
Why didn't you close the door?

617
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
I forgot.

618
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
I thought you were rolling down from the bed.

619
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
My god, Brother Cheng.

620
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
You two are really together.

621
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
Yes.

622
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,260
All people slept early today?

623
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
Right.

624
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,260
We're filming cereal for a short time,

625
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,260
so we'd better hurry our worries away.

626
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
That, you really were right.

627
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,260
Brother Cheng, why did you become a legend?

628
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,260
He just came down from the bed.

629
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
I helped him.

630
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,260
He was smiling.

631
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,260
Listen, he came down again.

632
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
Then you don't need to help him anymore?

633
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Forget it.

634
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,260
The human race needs to learn to grow by themselves.

635
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
No, I didn't.

636
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
No.

637
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
I heard it again.

638
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
I won't bring you tomorrow.

639
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,460
Listen to my nurse.

640
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,140
Her subjectsora's pill.

641
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,660
Class Gioid wyscood.

642
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,340
What's vederebed?

643
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
Take this Silence Futurary to bed.

644
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,180
Do you still...

645
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,440
She probably likes할

646
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,660
memory easily.

647
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,620
That's fine, leave it to us.

648
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,100
inding.

649
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,980
One of us

650
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,620
Mom.

651
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,060
Why does he yangASY come out?

652
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,300
He comes up anyway?

653
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,940
Why does�m whose head looking so good with the cover of hisくぶ?

654
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,380
Such a've got too much skin Во

655
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,100
Tao LAUGHTER

656
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,780
Damn it, first time meeting you in summer.

657
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,440
I feel pity for the Pisces.

658
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,160
Let's start off with a simple girlleaf.

659
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,880
Yep.

660
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,980
Sis.

661
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,840
Sorry to break up with you.

662
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,900
I'm flattered!

663
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,620
So, after playing hard and being very cautious,

664
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,820
you'll gradually look better.

665
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,820
You can see that

666
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,360
everyone outside of this world

667
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,840
is holding a challenge.

668
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,280
Except you.

669
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,540
Then,

670
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,000
you will also are

671
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,440
sharing an authority with others.

672
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,200
These 2 moments

673
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,560
start from day 2.

674
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Don't be afraid.

675
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,100
I'm not afraid.

676
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,760
Even your hair will be fine.

677
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,840
Here.

678
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,100
Look,

679
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,600
it's Castle of Yellow zobbers.

680
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,320
ヾ!!!

681
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,240
No, no.

682
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
What are you doing?

683
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
You have a hair on your head.

684
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
A big one.

685
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,320
I'm practicing waist-lifting today.

686
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
5-6-1, are you going to exercise?

687
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
I'm going to exercise.

688
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
Go, go, go.

689
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Healthy people, healthy life.

690
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Master.

691
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Thanks.

692
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,320
5-6-1, are you going to exercise?

693
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
You are not even a fighter.

694
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
You are not even a fighter.

695
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Why are you so serious about training?

696
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
You are not a fighter either.

697
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
What are you doing?

698
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
I was just checking the schedule.

699
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
Don't be so serious about what you want to say.

700
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
You can't even get me a baby next time.

701
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
I'm definitely a fighter.

702
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
You are definitely not a fighter.

703
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
You are definitely not a fighter.

704
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Why are you talking to me?

705
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Why are you talking to me?

706
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
I'm not talking to you.

707
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
I'm not talking to you.

708
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
I'm talking to you.

709
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
You are a weakling.

710
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
You are a weakling.

711
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
Mom.

712
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
What's up?

713
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Have you seen Ruo Zhi?

714
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Ruo Zhi.

715
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Where?

716
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
There.

717
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
I'm coming.

718
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
I'm coming.

719
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
What are they doing?

720
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
There's you.

721
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Who is it?

722
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
It's not over.

723
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,720
The new pair is here!

724
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,720
The new pair is here.

725
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,920
How is it?

726
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
It looks good.

727
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,520
The black one was more beautiful.

728
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,920
It's better than yours.

729
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,520
It's better.

730
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,120
It's called the responsibility of coming and going.

731
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,920
Do you understand?

732
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,920
Didn't you say you were afraid of fat?

733
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,520
I don't even have half of my shoes in my heart.

734
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,120
A girl says she's fat.

735
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,720
Can you believe it?

736
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,320
She's not fat.

737
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,520
She's wearing the same clothes.

738
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,120
What are you talking about?

739
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Do you have any manners?

740
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,320
Who says she's wearing the same clothes?

741
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,120
A perfect woman

742
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
should be able to express her feelings

743
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,120
in every way she can.

744
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,920
The night is about to pass.

745
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,920
Are you still remember?

746
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
I spent my time with you.

747
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
How many times do I want to hear?

748
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,720
Don't hesitate to ask me to learn.

749
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Let's all stop.

750
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,920
Youth is not leaving a trace.

751
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,920
If I chase after a dream

752
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,920
I will chase after the light

753
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,920
I will chase after the light

754
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,920
If I chase after a dream

755
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,320
I will chase after the light

756
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,920
So we are in the future

757
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
I will chase after the light

758
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,920
I will chase after the light

759
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,920
How much is the heart that is forever

760
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Remember that moment when the wind blows

761
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,920
We have seen the sun and the moon together
