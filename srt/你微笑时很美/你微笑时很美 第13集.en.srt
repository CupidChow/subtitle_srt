Hurry up. What are you doing?

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,320
Coming, coming!

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,350
Everyone,

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,600
to some extent,

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,990
is enthusiastic about dress-up and role-playing games.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,830
That's because these types of games

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,710
can satisfy many subconscious needs.

9
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,460
Perhaps these needs

10
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,539
are ones they themselves aren't even aware of,

11
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,270
nor would they admit to having.

12
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,510
Who says games are all fake?

13
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,220
Sometimes,

14
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,400
they are more honest than you are,

15
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,280
and they help you see yourself more clearly.

16
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,960
At the same time,

17
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,840
they also make you understand

18
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,010
that these are ultimately

19
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,370
just human delusions.

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920

Tong Yao!

24
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,060
What were you thinking?

25
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,280
You're here for the match,

26
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,680
not for romance.

27
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,390
You promised yourself not to date esports players.

28
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,350
Have you forgotten the goal you set for yourself?

29
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,940
You mustn't let Jinyang's words affect you.

30
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,670
You mustn't!

31
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,550
Idiot.

32

Quadra kill!

33
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,310
Guang, Team KING's jungler, has secured a quadra kill!

34
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,380
Once again, we are amazed by

35
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,630
the excellence of this talented esports boy.

36
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,370
Although he's in a secondary league team,

37
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,700
his mechanical skills

38
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,490
can be said to be

39
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,090
on par with any jungler in the national league.

40
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,600
Tong Yao.

41
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,040
What are you doing?

42
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,490
You wrote this?

43
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,790
You've taken notes of the habits

44
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,520
of all the players on Team KING, our rival?

45
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,990
As the saying goes, "Know yourself and your enemy, and you can fight a hundred battles without defeat."

46
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,680
Let me see.

47
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,560
Not bad.

48
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,150
We should all learn from you.

49
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,610
This...

50
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,350
Good work.

51
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:15,870
This kind of work

52
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,900
should have been done by the data analysts.

53
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,460
But since the qualifiers have just started,

54
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,260
and we're facing a newly promoted team like Team KING,

55
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,630
we didn't think it was necessary to pay much attention.

56
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,930
And considering you were all tired from yesterday's game,

57
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,060
we planned to let everyone relax a bit.

58
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,940
The term "newly promoted team" refers to

59
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,850
a team that has moved up

60
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,510
from a lower category to a higher one.

61
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,950
But we shouldn't look down on them

62
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,030
just because they were newly promoted.

63
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,500
It's not that we're looking down on them.

64
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,750
It's just we have stronger teams to face.

65
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,270
Just facing the completely transformed Team YQCB alone

66
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,930
requires a lot of analysis and habit-tracking.

67
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,100
You were up late organizing materials last night too, weren't you?

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,600
Keep it up.

69
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,440
Let's go.

70
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Good luck.

71
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:34,920
Hey.

72
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,920
If they reach level 3 first,

73
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,960
the probability of the ADC going in to apply strong pressure is

74
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,730
85.37%.

75
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,050
Why did you snatch my notebook?

76
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,650
What if it was a girl's diary?

77
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,240
Where did you get that percentage from?

78
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,560
I calculated it from the dozens of matches I watched,

79
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,360
of course.

80
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,200
You watched dozens of matches of the newly promoted team?

81
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,760
Yes.

82
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,300

83

Why are you guys so arrogant?

84
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Be careful not to lose to them today.

85
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,450
Is your abdominal pain better?

86
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,710
Not really.

87
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,530
You still have abdominal pain, and you're not wearing slippers.

88
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,480
No woman has dysmenorrhea for four or five days, okay?

89
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,600
If that were the case, how are women supposed to live?

90
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,130
If it doesn't hurt much, have some breakfast.

91
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,679
Why are you acting like a breakfast butler?

92
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,690
Put on your slippers before eating.

93
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,990
I'll wait for you outside.

94
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,520
Shorty.

95
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,210
Lend me your girl's diary.

96
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,370
Why do you want to read my girl's diary?

97
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,570
I want to see Team KING's data analysis.

98
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,360
Didn't you say you didn't need to see it because they're not a strong team?

99
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,490
You've already written it, so I might as well take a look.

100

Come take a look at this.

103
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,120
Starting by clearing their own jungle until level 4,

104
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,380
they'll then invade the enemy jungle to steal small camps.

105
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,530
After clearing the first set of camps,

106
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,650
there's a high chance they'll gank mid lane.

107
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,560
They'll try their luck there,

108
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,000
and if they fail to gank mid lane, they'll poke and harass

109
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,250
the enemy mid laner a bit, and then recall.

110
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,310
There should be a counter-gank here.

111
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,520
What the hell?

112
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,960
She's teaching you how to counter-gank. Don't you get it?

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,670
I don't.

114
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,610
Why did she write so many of her own thoughts

115
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,600
in the tactical analysis?

116
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,330
Because she's a born actress.

117
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,280
A drama queen.

118
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,690

please look in this direction.

What's appearing on the screen

is the introduction of Team KING's players.

128
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,840
The first to appear on the screen

129
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,720
is Team KING's captain, Guang, who's a jungler.

130
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,160
It was he who single-handedly

131
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,240
carried Team KING

132
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,890
from the qualifiers into the National League.

133
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,720
With bare hands,

134
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,980
we climbed up from the secondary league.

135

We thirst for victory

136

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,240
craving for the last drop of water.

138
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,400
This is a battle for survival.

139
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,790
We will give it our all.

140
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,280
So,

141
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,450
veterans of Team ZGDX,

142

Player Guang is really full of youthful vigor.

145
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,760
-Just a rookie.
-But his youthful vigor

146
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,920
is not unfounded.

147
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,970
His confidence is quite well-grounded.

148
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,050
After all, he has just reached the age

149
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,640
required by national regulations to participate in professional leagues,

150
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,280
and he's already led Team KING

all the way from the qualifiers into the National League.

152

As for himself,

153
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,440
he's the team's most powerful driving force

154
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,910
and the tempo engine.

155
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:32,840
That's right.

156
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,600
It was also because in the finals of the qualifiers,

157
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,330
Guang forcefully snatched Orochi and turned the tables

158
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,680
that he led Team KING

159
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,770

can give Team ZGDX a surprise.

Speaking of this, although...

165

They want to target me.

166

Okay.

-Okay.
-I think it's still pretty hard.

Well, it's hard to say.

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,080
There's an old Chinese saying

171
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,080
that goes, "Newborn calves aren't afraid of tigers."

172
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,560
Let's wait and see.

173
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,120
As we can see,

174
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
both sides are ready now.

175
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,640
Let's see their final lineup choices.

176
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,770
Alright, let's see.

177
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,930
Now, as for Team ZGDX,

178
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,520
top laner Cat picked Ibaraki Doji,

179
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,680
jungler K picked Yoto Hime,

180
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,770
mid laner Smiling picked Ootengu,

181
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,050
ADC Chessman

182
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,300
will play Dodomeki,

183
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,990
and Pang as support picked Ichimokuren.

184
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,720
Now, let's take a look at Team KING.

185
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,480
They picked Shuten Doji for top lane,

186
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,200
Guang as jungler picked Mannendake,

187
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,890
mid laner Jung picked Menreiki,

188
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,720
and bot laners SKY and YC picked the combo

189
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,160
of Hakuro and Kuro.

190
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,600
Don't forget, everyone,

191
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,390
focus on ganking the jungler.

192
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,930
Our strategy is top, mid, and jungle coordination.

193
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,860
-Got it.
-Got it.

194
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,100
Good luck, everyone.

195
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,490
This game is yours, guys.

196
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,800
Cheng and I will just be supporting.

197
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,400
Alright.

198
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,260
We'll carry Cheng to victory today.

199
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,940
Sis.

200
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,260
Do you want to carry the whole team?

201
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,330
Do your job, top and jungle.

202
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,330
Don't count on me.

203
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm just an invisible mid laner,

204
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,400
trembling in fear of the enemy jungler.

205
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,060
It's the enemy jungler who should be trembling.

206
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,330
So, the ten players

207
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,060
have all picked their shikigami.

208
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,210
What kind of audiovisual feast

209
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,740
will these ten shikigami

210
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,490
bring us?

211
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,400
Let's enter the game right away.

212
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,290
God Ming.

213
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you think Tong Yao's strategy will work?

214
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,560
Let's have confidence in Smiling's girl's diary.

215
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,370
This is strange.

216
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,720
K left a camp untouched

217
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,150
and went straight into the bush.

218
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,680
What's this supposed to mean?

219
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,970
Smiling has also come to the top lane and jungle area.

220
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,350
Could it be that K wants to

221
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,050
leave this camp for Smiling to kill?

222
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,600
But he's already falling behind in levels.

223
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,960
It doesn't make sense to give up any more economy.

224
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,920
Moreover, at this point,

225
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,680
the opponent's level is already high enough for a push.

226
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,240
Team ZGDX's decision this round

227
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,170
is a bit puzzling.

228
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,570
It really is.

229
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,050
This is truly bizarre.

230
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,960
Is the bush really that attractive?

231
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,920
Not just K, but Smiling has also gone into the bush.

232
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,600
Support, help me take a look.

233
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
I'll go invade their jungle.

234
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,970
As we can see,

235
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,850
Guang is already in position to invade the enemy's jungle.

236
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,790
So, K and Smiling

237
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,640
are planning to kill Guang in the jungle.

238
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,990
Guang is here. K, let's go!

239
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,390
Okay.

240
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,830
Here it comes, here it comes!

241
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,800
Yoto Hime and Ootengu

242
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,240
are surrounding and chasing Guang relentlessly!

243
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,040
Kill him. Don't let him get away.

244
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,400
Ootengu used his blink

245
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,450
and instantly killed Mannendake with his first skill!

246
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,840
Nice! First blood secured!

247
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,680
Nice!

248
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,360
Nice!

249
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,590
That was brilliant!

250
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,720
Mid lane and jungle coordination.

251
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
K and Smiling worked together in the mid lane and jungle.

252
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
-What's going on?
-What happened?

253
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,700
Why didn't you tell me their mid laner was missing?

254
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,930
How was I supposed to know?

255
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,040
I saw her push the minion wave

256
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,550
and retreat, so I thought she recalled.

257
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,040
How did she know

258
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,930
you would invade their jungle at this time?

259
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,270
Shouldn't K normally

260
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,620
clear the top lane jungle first and then go clear the bottom jungle?

261
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,980
They must be cheating.

262
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,300
Talking big, saying they'll dominate us.

263
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,610
Cat, keep it low-key.

264
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,730
But our skills don't allow us to be low-key.

265
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,890
But here's the question.

266
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,100
How did the two of them

267
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,330
know that Guang was coming to invade their jungle

268
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,090
without any vision of the enemy?

269
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,000
From my point of view,

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,310
Team ZGDX must have studied their enemy team thoroughly.

271
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,860
Whether it's the regular qualifier match, or...

272
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,440
Tong Yao.

273
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,590
The things you wrote in your little notebook

274
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,930
are quite effective, huh?

275
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,990
Of course they are.

276
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,720
Sis, awesome!

277
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,680
If that's really the case,

278
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,290
it's incredibly professional and impressive.

279
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,210
As a veteran top team,

280
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,080
to be able to study a new team

281
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,320
so thoroughly,

282
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,050
they've really got something.

283
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,260
And if Team ZGDX has really figured out

284
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,160
Team KING's strategies,

285
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,270
Team King is in a very dangerous situation

286
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,200
in this match.

287
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,290
Come on, K.

288
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,350
Let's wipe the floor with them today.

289
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,730
As we can see,

290
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,790
K is already lying in wait for Guang in the bush.

291
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,960
It seems that the enemy jungler's strategy

292
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,860
has been completely figured out by Team ZGDX.

293
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,580
Bring it on!

294
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,340
At this moment, Team KING's support is on his way!

295
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,330
Kill.

296
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,880
K's Yoto Hime beautifully landed against the wall

297
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,840
and used her third ability to dash away!

298
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,560
Even though the enemy's support arrived in time...

299
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,170
Nice!

300
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,160
It was still too late.

301
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,440
What were you thinking, my friend? See ya.

302
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,180
that Team KING's mid laner will fight head-on with the enemy.]

303
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,180
[When fighting one-on-one, if the HP and economic gaps are not big, there's a 72% chance

304
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,030
Now let's look at Ootengu's core ability.

305
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,640
This ability

306
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,240
relies entirely on predicting the timing of the opponent's skill release.

307
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,260
The shikigami Ootengu

308
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,250
is a bit overwhelmingly strong

309
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,690
played by Smiling.

310
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,960
In this match,

311
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,069
Guang, as the jungler, is almost completely...

312
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,800
I'll cover you, I'll cover you.

313
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,240
Indeed.

314
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,609
Wait for me to farm, wait for me to farm.

315
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,940
He hasn't fed any kills,

316
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,410
but his economy is still significantly behind the opponent's.

317
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,210
That's right.

318
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,000
This fight is really smooth.

319
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,540
What's wrong with the enemy jungler?

320
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,340
He's just been farming and doesn't dare to show up.

321
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,810
K, Guang is in their jungle.

322
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,410
Follow me.

323
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:34,940
Okay.

324
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,370
We can't fight them. Let's retreat immediately.

325
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:39,970
K, attack!

326
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:40,910
Roger that.

327
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,090
They seized the timing with great accuracy.

328
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,000
Guang doesn't have his ultimate,

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,020
and Team KING's overall economy is being crushed.

330
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,740
Nice!

331
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,400
Tong Yao has completely figured out Guang's jungle tempo.

332
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,230
Let's take a look at the bottom lane.

333
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,290
Chessman is already leading the team to push the tower.

334
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,600
Tong Yao, come here quickly for the team fight.

335
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,460
Be right there.

336
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,530
Can Team KING withstand the pressure and defend their high ground?

337
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,610
Pang, watch your positioning.

338
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,270
Roger that.

339
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,560
Since Team KING

340
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,320
lacks the damage from the core jungle position...

341
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,400
Retreat, retreat. Let's not fight for now.

342
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,350
Chase, chase!

343
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,600
Shoot him, shoot him!

344
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,450
And look.

345
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,060
After Chessman pushed down the second bottom tower...

346
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,040
Here we go. K. I'm going in. Follow up.

347
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,620
Go, go, go. I'm right behind you.

348
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,150
Good, good. Let's go, let's go!

349
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,200
Good to go. Good to go!

350
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm coming!

351
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,890
Another team fight. Another team fight! Do they have a chance?

352
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,230
They've pushed to the high ground in the top lane.

353
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,160
Smiling is also constantly destroying the high ground in the mid lane.

354
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,750
Keep going.

355
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,130
Stay steady.

356
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,920
Watch this fight.

357
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,090
-Team KING can't take it anymore.
-Retreat!

358
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,400
After the team fight, their HP was critically low,

359
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,460
and Chessman scored multiple kills.

360
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,570
Shoot the tower, shoot the tower!

361
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,770
Go, go, go. Good to go.

362
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,240
While relentlessly chasing Hakuro,

363
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,480
Ootengu managed to take down Hakuro.

364
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,520
-So exciting!
-Team kill!

365
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,060
This fight was truly breathtaking.

366
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,400
Congratulations to Team ZGDX for winning the first game.

367
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,060
Congratulations to Team ZGDX for winning the second game.

368
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,320
Now, the first match of Group A

369
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,170
of 2020 National OPL

370
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,360
between Team ZGDX and Team KING is over.

371
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,330
Team ZGDX secured another victory,

372
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,060
currently ranking first in the group standings.

373
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Bro!

374
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,260
♫We will be your hero♫

375
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,680
It was a breeze. I didn't even break a sweat.

376
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,560
Let's go.

377
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,970
It was too easy.

378
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,160
Sis, you were amazing.

379
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,330
So, judging from the past two matches,

380
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,520
when facing our veteran powerhouse of OPL,

381
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,090
Team ZGDX,

382
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,560
the newly promoted

383
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,370
Team King

384
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,640
[Defeat]

385
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,080
still has a noticeable gap in strength.

386
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,540
Indeed.

387
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,280
If we look at the first game,

388
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,800
the jungler, Guang, was marked and defended against during the entire game.

389
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,960
In the second game, he was just farming the jungle.

390
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,680
What the hell? What kind of performance was that?

391
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,330
Let's go.

392
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,240
Let's go. I'm done watching.

393
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,770
Let's go.

394
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,240
Moreover, Team ZGDX

395
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,600
has thoroughly figured out Team KING's strategies.

396
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,060
They've got them down pat.

397
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,930
It can be said that

398
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,840
for a veteran powerhouse,

399
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,700
to be able to study a newly promoted team's strategies

400
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,880
so thoroughly

401
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,080
is very professional.

402
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,120
-It doesn't happen a lot.
-Yes.

403
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,160
So, it's only reasonable for Team ZGDX

404
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,310
to win this match.

405
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,200
Yes.

406
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,230
Let's congratulate Team ZGDX again

407
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,130
for winning their second match in the National League.

408
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,570
Congratulations.

409
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,630
Congratulations.

410
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,270
Congratulations.

411
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,400
Cheng.

412
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,610
I didn't expect your team

413
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,620
would even study the teams promoted through the qualifiers.

414
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,700
It was truly impressive.

415
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,100
It was an exciting match.

416
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,860
It's just our mid laner gets nervous no matter who she faces.

417
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,990
Don't overthink it.

418
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,520
Congratulations.

419
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,240
ZGDX!

420
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,080
What?

421
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,520
Did you just say something bad about me to them?

422
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,450
Do you have paranoia or something?

423
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,190
Then what were you just saying to Guang...

424
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,660
Cheng.

425
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,800
The MVP interview is about to start.

426
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,230
Please come to the interview area.

427
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,760
Okay.

428
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,920
Pang, help me pack my things.

429
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,760
No problem.

430
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,840
There are always people trying to hurt me.

431
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,570
Congratulations to Team ZGDX.

432
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,970
Congratulations to you, Chessman, for successfully winning

433
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,850
the first match

434
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,850
of OPL National League qualifiers.

435
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,710
Is there anything

436
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,520
you'd like to say to your fans right now?

437
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,160
Thank you to all the fans for your support.

438
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,360
We'll give our all in the National League.

439
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,970
It seems you

440
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,830
really understand what the fans are expecting, Cheng.

441
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,900
I'd also like to ask,

442
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,000
in today's match,

443
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,170
you were up against

444
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,400
the newly promoted team

445
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,200
from the OPL qualifiers, right?

446
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,130
As a traditional powerhouse,

447
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,850
Team ZGDX obviously made thorough preparations.

448
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,120
It was a bit surprising.

449
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,360
So why did you do that?

450
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,160
Was that your secret to victory?

451
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,000
No.

452
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,970
It's just that our mid laner gets nervous no matter who she faces.

453
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,040
If we slack off against any team, she'd say we're getting cocky.

454
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,640
Before we left this morning,

455
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,610
she was loudly announcing at the training base

456
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,070
that we'd lose this match.

457
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,990
It seems you

458
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,330
are getting along well with your team's new mid laner, Cheng.

459
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,860
Well, we're not that close.

460
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,850
But she's very skillful.

461
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,350
She's also very diligent.

462
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,360
As the captain,

463
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,490
I'm very happy to have such a teammate.

464
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
With her joining,

465
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,230
this summer,

466
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,060
Team ZGDX will be stronger than ever before.

467
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,090
Do you feel the same way?

468
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,890
You know what?

469
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,730
I saw a beauty blogger

470
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,930
apply a new lipstick the other day.

471
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,880
The lipstick on her lips

472
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,820
looked like fairies dancing on her mouth.

473
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,940
Why are you so slow?

474
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,040
My computer cable and mouse cord got tangled.

475
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,760
It took me a while to untangle them.

476
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,960
-Guys.
-Good for you.

477
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,690
Team DQ.Five that will be using this lounge

478
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,580
is already on their way.

479
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,640
Let's tidy up a bit.

480
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,270
I'll finish eating in a minute.

481
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,260
We should take these away too.

482
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,760
I almost forgot.

483
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,810
You're like the queen of manners in the esports industry.

484
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,400
Good job.

485
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,160
That's how classy our team is.

486
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,490
Strong, and classy.

487
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,730
Perfect.

488
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,360
Hello?

489
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,050
I also said we should clean up just now, but did anyone listen to me?

490
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,040
Why did everyone listen when she said we should clean up?

491
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,840
That's gender discrimination.

492
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,990
You guys.

493
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,480
I'm going to report you

494
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,150
to the esports industry committee later.

495
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,110
Go ahead.

496
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,520
You'll be the first one I report.

497
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,440
Go, go.

498
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,500
-I'm not afraid at all.
-Good.

499
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,030
I won't let you off the hook.

500
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,650
Tong Yao.

501
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,240
When is Cheng coming back?

502
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,530
I don't know.

503
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,560
You came in so late. Didn't you see him?

504
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,370
I didn't.

505
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,450
I'm telling you, with Cheng's performance today,

506
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,210
he's going to receive so much admiration.

507
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,240
Looks like we'll have to wait until the cows come home.

508
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,560
You guys, check out the Douban special discussion group.

509
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,090
The Esports Farm is bombarded with comments.

510
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,040
Judging from the current situation,

511
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,650
I'm afraid it's not Esports Farm that's bombarded,

512
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,880
but Team KING.

513
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
Look at these headlines.

514
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,880
"As expected from a newly promoted team."

515
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,130
"So what if they were champions in the qualifiers?"

516
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,400
-"Headshot by Team ZGDX."
-Look at this.

517
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,600
"So tragic. I'm speechless."

518
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,660
"Team KING's jungler is killing me."

519
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,130
"The gap is still huge."

520
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,320
"Their tactics in the qualifiers were too simple.

521
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,370
Even though they successfully got into the OPL,

522
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,230
they're going to get destroyed."

523
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,800
Why isn't anyone praising my performance today?

524
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,290
They have no time to do that.

525
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,290
Everyone's busy

526
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,750
trying to divide the blame among the five members of Team KING.

527
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,930
Divide?

528
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,340
Divide what blame?

529
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,320
This comment.

530
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,970
Someone said, "In the 10 seconds of the teamfight,

531
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,240
the ADC spent 9 seconds just dodging around like a snake."

532
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,880
"The Support was invisible the whole game.

533
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,570
Couldn't even cast a shield."

534
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,680
Anyway, every one of them is getting criticized. No one's spared.

535
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,120
Although everyone's being criticized,

536
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,920
I think

537
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,440
their team's jungler, Guang, is getting the worst of it.

538
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,300
Yeah, he's really in a tough spot.

539
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,880
Starting from the first fight of the first game,

540
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,840
when he wanted to invade our jungle and steal camps

541
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,400
but got caught by Tong Yao and K,

542
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,650
and ended up giving first blood.

543
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,730
Why didn't you tell me their mid laner was missing?

544
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,730
He's been exposed to our vision

545
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,610
almost the entire game.

546
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,930
A jungler needs to be elusive,

547
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,040
making unexpected attacks

548
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,370
to give teammates early lane advantages.

549
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,610
A jungler who only farms in the early game

550
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,440
and disappears in the jungle like a coward

551
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,930
will definitely be

552
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,220
criticized by the audience until they're blue in the face.

553
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,090
Unfortunately,

554
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,210
Guang did it again in the second game.

555
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,540
He disappeared in the jungle early on,

556
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,080
and during that crucial Orochi teamfight,

557
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,450
he failed to provide timely support.

558
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,040
He only showed up after the 4v5 fight when all his teammates were dead.

559
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,300
By the time he arrived,

560
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,960
they'd almost lost the game.

561
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,570
He even fed us the last kill when he arrived.

562
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,840
After the first game ended,

563
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,100
they must have known there was a problem.

564
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,390
But at that moment,

565
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,930
it was difficult to come up with a solution.

566
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,410
So in the second game,

567
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,870
having known he couldn't ambush anyone,

568
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,080
Guang could only focus on farming the jungle

569
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,720
and try to find chances for teamfight.

570
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,320
What else could he have done?

571
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,000
You think the spectators would care about that?

572
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,260
All they can see is that

573
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
in the first game,

574
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,810
Guang failed to counter-jungle and couldn't ambush anyone,

575
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,010
feeding first blood,

576
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,010
and in the second game,

577
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,280
Guang focused on farming the jungle,

578
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,240
had no impact, and was practically invisible the entire game.

579
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,300
It was like Team KING was playing 4v5.

580
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,610
These are the most obvious things.

581
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,840
That's why they're most critical of Guang,

582
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,700
saying all kinds of nasty things.

583
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,190
Who's to blame? So tragic.

584
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,930
Don't make it sound like Team ZGDX

585
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,330
won easily.

586
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,180
Where are you going?

587
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,250
To the restroom.

588
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,240
Come back quickly.

589
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,040
We'll leave when Cheng returns.

590
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,370
Trash.

591
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,860
The queen of manners has retired.

592
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,500
Exactly.

593
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,900
Quick to come online, quick to go offline.

594
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,130
This is totally unacceptable.

595
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,380
Pang, go.

596
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,280
Why me?

597
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Just go.

598
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,400
Or I'll report you.

599
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,890
-Collect the trash.
-Go.

600
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,440
Go, go.

601
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,340
Collect it.

602
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,750
Good boy.

603
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,400
You go throw it away.

604
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,930
Let me finish eating first.

605
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,330
I heard some noise,

606
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,040
so I came in to check.

607
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,160
Sorry you had to see me like this.

608
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,290
Why are you hiding here, crying alone?

609
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,100
You already know why.

610
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,050
Is it because you lost the match?

611
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,720
We fought for this spot against secondary league players

612
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,520
who were like a pack of wolf cubs in the qualifiers.

613
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,840
We came to the venue full of joy,

614
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,810
but little did we know

615
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,060
we'd lose so badly.

616
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,520
Losing the match was bad enough,

617
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,650
but then I saw the Esports Farm

618
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,450
filled with such harsh insults.

619
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,490
It's not like I haven't seen things like this before,

620
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,750
the esports forums praising winners and trashing losers.

621
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,800
I had prepared myself

622
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,930
mentally for the criticism if we lost.

623
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,630
But when it actually happened to me,

624
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,500
I still couldn't take it.

625
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,960
I wanted to tell everyone

626
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,940
that we really had no choice at the time.

627
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,750
We could only farm and wait for chances of teamfights.

628
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,680
We couldn't ambush because it was truly impossible.

629
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,600
Next time, with preparation, we'll do better.

630
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,290
But there won't be a next time.

631
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,240
So many people.

632
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,890
So many posts.

633
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,000
So many insults.

634
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,270
It's impossible to respond to them all.

635
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,480
You already know those people always praise winners and trash losers,

636
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,880
so why do you care so much?

637
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,370
Because they used to say I could lead the team to victory,

638
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,180
and that I was the best at creating opportunities for my teammates.

639
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,470
Although it might seem

640
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,280
that I was the only one chasing opportunities,

641
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,080
what they didn't know is

642
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,840
every single person in our team

643
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,640
longed for such an opportunity.

644
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,520
Everyone worked incredibly hard,

645
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,330
dreaming of entering

646
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,280
OPL

647
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,750
and proving ourselves

648
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,030
in front of the national audience.

649
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,190
I knew Team ZGDX was strong,

650
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,850
and we probably couldn't beat you.

651
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,130
I originally thought that even if we lost,

652
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,060
it wouldn't be this embarrassing.

653
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,390
At least we'd have some chance.

654
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,920
Deep down inside,

655
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,030
what we'd always longed for

656
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,220
was a chance to win, just like this.

657
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,290
I understand.

658
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
How could you possibly understand?

659
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,850
You started playing in the professional league in such a strong team,

660
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,580
and you're skillful yourself.

661
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,710
No one would criticize you.

662
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,890
The only one who wouldn't get criticized

663
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,250
is probably our captain.

664
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,870
If Team ZGDX loses a match one day,

665
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,330
they'll definitely criticize us like crazy.

666
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,330
Do you think they'd spare me?

667
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,320
Actually, the reason you're feeling this

668
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,060
is because when you won the games,

669
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,660
you were praised too highly.

670
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,490
So now that you've lost, it hurts more.

671
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,930
This feeling

672
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,250
is actually also quite familiar to me.

673
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,550
When I first joined the team,

674
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,890
I was like a fearless newborn calf.

675
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,360
I was on cloud nine after winning just one practice match.

676
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,210
Later,

677
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,710
we had a match with Team TAT from Korea.

678
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,290
You know about that, right?

679
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,450
That time, I lost to Tai so badly that I almost developed a fear of Korean players.

680
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,920
Even now, when I occasionally see that ID

681
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,290
in ranked matches,

682
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,350
my palms still get sweaty from fear.

683
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,330
I still haven't found a way to fully recover from that.

684
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,550
But starting from the National League,

685
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,280
you've been playing very well.

686
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,060
You don't seem nervous

687
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,480
or uncomfortable at all.

688
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,570
You and your team work together perfectly.

689
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,300
I can see that your teammates also trust you a lot.

690
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,590
Your team is great too.

691
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,000
Besides, this is just the beginning.

692
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,600
Your professional careers have just started.

693
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,830
As a newly promoted team from the qualifiers,

694
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,040
after you see more professional teams' strategies

695
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,090
and tactics,

696
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,550
you'll have a lot of room for improvement.

697
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,620
The next time we meet on the battlefield,

698
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,170
you'll become stronger.

699
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,290
But in the end, we were still

700
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,820
easily crushed by you guys.

701
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,570
Easily?

702
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,290
Esports Farm says it was easy,

703
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,860
but was it really that easy?

704
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,120
What's with getting misled by the special discussion group?

705
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,450
If you want to know if it was really easy,

706
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,680
why don't you ask me?

707
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,160
I have the most say in this.

708
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,420
To study your jungling routes

709
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,650
and team strategies,

710
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,240
I watched all the videos

711
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,200
of Team KING's matches.

712
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,760
I only came to

713
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,490
all these conclusions

714
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,450
after watching dozens of matches.

715
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,440
Before today's match,

716
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,640
I was still watching your qualifier finals.

717
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,970
Look at my dark circles.

718
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,440
So don't cry.

719
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
What's to cry for?

720
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,070
Having a clear goal

721
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,010
and working hard towards it,

722
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,200
isn't that a good thing?

723
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,360
Isn't that the whole point of the qualifiers?

724
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,840
No team can easily defeat

725
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,560
another team.

726
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,450
So don't belittle yourself like this.

727
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,730
You've earned

728
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,330
a position in OPL.

729
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,270
So hold onto it.

730
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,290
You're being a bit too nice.

731
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,620
I just don't like being mindlessly praised.

732
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,090
Isn't it good,

733
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,490
having all other teams fear you?

734
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,420
How is that good?

735
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,370
I stay up late every night reviewing matches.

736
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,790
My eyes are nearly blind from watching them.

737
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,650
Do you think it was for getting mindlessly praised?

738
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
You watched dozens of the newly promoted team's matches?

739
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,160
Yeah.

740
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,920
You must have a lot of free time.

741
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,920
Jian Yang.

742
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,160
You need to do homework to beat your ex-boyfriend?

743
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,620
As the saying goes, "Know yourself and your enemy, and you'll win every battle."

744
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,180
So, in that case,

745
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,180
when I lost to Tai...

746
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,200
Why did you stop talking?

747
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,910
What are you thinking about?

748
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,880
While I'm trying to comfort you,

749
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,010
I've also realized something.

750
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,410
What's that?

751
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,730
Before someone seemingly effortlessly defeats you,

752
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,590
who knows how much work he's done behind the scenes?

753
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,960
We're all human.

754
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,449
How could there be a person

755
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,920
as strong as an alien?

756
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,000
So,

757
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,139
never underestimate your opponent.

758
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,670
Don't fight a battle you're not prepared for.

759
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,420
Thank you.

760
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:29,969
Let's go.

761
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,679
Cheng.

762
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,000
I called you so many times, and you didn't answer.

763
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So this is where you've been hiding.

764
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,120
[Missed calls: 4 calls from Long-legged Ice King]

765
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,110
I...

766
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,389
What were you playing?

767
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,320
Hide and seek?

768
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,580
The place you chose is really unexpected.

769
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,280
Not bad. Quite clever.

770
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,030
What do you mean?

771
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,450
Can't you talk properly?

772
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,140
Thank you. I'll leave now.

773
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,450
Goodbye, Cheng.

774
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,460
Hello. I found her.

775
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,530
Be right there.

776
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,200
You made the jungler from the other team

777
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,750
cry in the safe passage?

778
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,090
What do you mean?

779
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,720
Exactly what I said.

780
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,210
Why did he look at you with

781
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,410
that sorrowful gaze?

782
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,800
He was indeed in the safe passage just now,

783
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,640
and so was I.

784
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,520
He did cry,

785
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,450
but...

786
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,440
How should I put this...

787
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,720
Can't you talk properly?

788
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,810
What do you mean by "I made the other team's jungler cry"?

789
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,130
You can't use the word "make" so carelessly.

790
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,120
Then why did he look at you with

791
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,320
that sorrowful gaze?

792
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,980
How was that a sorrowful gaze?

793
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,050
Then tell me, what kind of look was it?

794
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,650
Don't you think it was a look of admiration?

795
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,050
That was a tamed look.

796
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,480
Where are they?

797
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,590
You did this kind of thing, and expected them to wait for you?

798
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,960
Tell me, do you have some grudge

799
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,750
against the title of team captain?

800
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,150
Two matches, two team captains collected.

801
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,000
Collecting them like stamps?

802
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,730
Is this some kind of

803
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,640
2020 OPL Limited Edition Stamps?

804
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,430
Shut up. You're a team captain too, okay?

805
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,160
Sorry I'm back late.

806
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,200
Where have you been?

807
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,330
Collecting stamps.

808
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,120
Cheng came back and saw you weren't here.

809
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,800
He risked being surrounded by fans again

810
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,450
to go look for you.

811
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,510
You didn't answer your phone either.

812
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,000
We thought you'd been kidnapped.

813
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,530
Why would anyone kidnap me?

814
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,230
To make me jungle for them?

815
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,650
-Sis.
-I won't lose anything.

816
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,170
Tell me the truth. Where did you go?

817
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,380
Only those who suffer losses know that.

818
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,640
I went to the restroom.

819
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,500
Why did our captain say you like collecting stamps?

820
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,520
I ran into Team KING's jungler

821
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,560
on my way to the restroom.

822
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,930
He was secretly crying in the safe passage.

823
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,720
So I comforted him a bit.

824
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,820
But the special discussion group's criticism is really harsh.

825
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,820
And they're praising us like crazy.

826
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,540
It makes me feel uneasy.

827
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,650
He dared to check the special discussion group after losing a match?

828
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,490
The day we lost the spring finals,

829
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,480
Rui uninstalled the Douban special discussion group

830
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,330
from our phones, one by one.

831
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,350
After all, he's a newcomer who's just started his career.

832
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,120
Besides,

833
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,970
Team KING was very strong in the qualifiers.

834
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,810
They've been praised all along.

835
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,510
And what's with you comforting him?

836
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,730
He's not just anyone,

837
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,920
but our enemy.

838
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,080
What if your comfort makes him soar?

839
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,730
What then?

840
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,590
No matter how much they soar, they can't beat us.

841
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,120
Because we're soaring too.

842
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,550
That's true.

843
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,130
While I'm comforting you,

844
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,540
I've also realized something.

845
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,830
Before someone seems to defeat you effortlessly,

846
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,680
who knows how much work he's done behind the scenes?

847
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,850
We're all human.

848
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,440
How could there be a person

849
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
as strong as an alien?

850
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,840
Cheng.

851
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,090
What?

852
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,220
Collecting stamps again?

853
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,010
I refuse.

854
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
No, that's not it.

855
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,900
Spit it out.

856
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,060
I want to challenge Tai again.

857
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,070
You're not afraid anymore?

858
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,770
Yes.

859
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,130
Okay.

860
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,760
When do you want to do it?

861
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,240
No way.

862
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,640
I don't agree.

863
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,560
You can't.

864
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,730
Why don't you agree?

865
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,610
Go.

866
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,720
I've got your back.

867
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,850
No. We have two matches next week.

868
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,830
What if it's like last time?

869
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,920
Mental breakdown.

870
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,680
Shut up.

871
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,540
Then for the remaining matches,

872
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,220
I'll play.

873
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,550
You'll lose.

874
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,400
Cheng,

875
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,700
I...

876
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,290
You've really made up your mind?

877
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,120
Yes.

878
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,120
Cheng, are you crazy?

879
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,440
Even if I don't help her arrange it,

880
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,700
she'll find a way to arrange it with them.

881
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,280
It's arranged.

882
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,480
Tomorrow afternoon.

883
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,900
Tomorrow? So soon?

884
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,230
If you get ready today, it's not too late.

885
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:11,690
Good luck.

886
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,610
Come on!
