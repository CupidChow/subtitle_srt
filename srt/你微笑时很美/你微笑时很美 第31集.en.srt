00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,790
and then casually get some jungle kills, delightful.

173
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,909
You just keep showing off.

174
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,590
You'll know when you lose first blood from being too flashy.

175
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,390
Let's take the small jungle and then get online.

176
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,990
Okay.

177
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,260
The final just started.

178
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,340
Making trouble?

179
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,830
Did Cheng ordered it?

180
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,190
I don't think so. Attack him.

181
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,470
Umibozu took the initiative,

182
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,750
or did Chessman order him to harass...

183
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,710
Have you eaten too much, Pang?

184
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,710
Low.

185
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,560
Still chasing?

186
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,470
I didn't even touch the camp.

187
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,990
Are you serious?

188
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,670
Cheng, come here. I'm gonna die.

189
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,550
Why come back?

190
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,060
Why don't you just die there and AFK?

191
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,510
With Umibozu's moves,

192
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,370
both blink and Soul Bind are lost.

193
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,550
Forcing the hard mode on the bottom lane.

194
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,420
Messing up.

195
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,550
I'm telling you,

196
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,550
in this round,

197
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,350
the moment Pang walked into the river,

198
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,410
the bottom lane was already gone.

199
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,770
K, let's go for the top lane first.

200
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,850
I'll carry.

201
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,420
What did you say?

202
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,650
Didn't you hear that

203
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,230
our top lane is a duo lane?

204
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,710
And you asked God K to help?

205
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,990
Don't you feel ashamed?

206
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,170
How dare you say that?

207
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,950
Stand still.

208
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,230
The other side is about to level up.

209
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,500
According to Pope's habits,

210
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,430
he must make a move to kill before level four,

211
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,230
Even if he's cautious,

212
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,380
he'll call the jungler to help him tower dive.

213
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,310
I'm level three,

214
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,220
Let's ambush.

215
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,870
Coming.

216
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,990
Making trouble again?

217
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,320
Be careful not to give a double kill.

218
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,040
The enemy's support has no Soul Bind or blink.

219
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,840
It feels wrong not to ambush him.

220
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:52,230
I can feel their greedy eyes

221
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,750
scanning me lewdly.

222
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,920
Weren't you just trying to

223
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,840
provoke in the enemy's jungle?

224
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,590
I was trying to lure Pope

225
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,950
to use blink to chase me.

226
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,870
But he didn't fall for it.

227
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,310
He's not stupid.

228
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,000
How could you trick him?

229
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,790
In this world, only our Cheng

230
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,610
can trick Pope.

231
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,350
Be careful, the enemy jungler is moving.

232
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,510
Directly accelerating to chase Pang's Umibozu.

233
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,840
Third skill plus a bunch of crazy normal attacks.

234
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,790
I'll control first,

235
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,670
I'll go into the tower later,

236
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,470
Don't rush in.

237
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,030
Here I go.

238
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,050
YQCB is about to make a move again.

239
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,060
Look.

240
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,940
There's a problem with YQCB's bottom lane coordination.

241
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,910
Why is it Pope who's taking the tower first?

242
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,480
Pope wants to tower dive.

243
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,370
Chessman saved Pang with his shield,

244
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,230
allowing him to escape smoothly.

245
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,660
After Pope enters the tower,

246
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,030
he's beaten to low health by the tower!

247
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,030
He can only use blink to escape.

248
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,789
I told you.

249
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,789
Never rush into trouble.

250
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,909
Pope was almost left behind.

251
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,840
If my Soul Bind had been ready two seconds earlier, he'd have been dead.

252
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,270
If that's the case, he wouldn't have rushed in like that.

253
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,430
He's a veteran at tower diving.

254
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,870
He calculates all the damage.

255
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,670
If he's not going to die, he won't.

256
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,750
Where's our jungler?

257
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,910
Lost in the jungle?

258
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
Where's my camp?

259
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,150
The enemy jungler is stealing.

260
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,890
Tong Yao, come and beat him up for me.

261
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,470
I'm coming.

262
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:57,910
Go.

263
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,830
Smiling lands a skill combo

264
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,750
to control Xbang,

265
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,510
follows up with blink,

266
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,430
and adds another skill for damage.

267
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,070
Xbang, without blink, is killed.

268
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,550
Tong Yao and jungler K of ZGDX work

269
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,950
in harmony to secure the first blood. Nice!

270
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,130
The events of this match tell us,

271
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,350
don't start trouble.

272
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,550
Those who do will pay a heavy price.

273
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,460
Why?

274
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,020
Look, the bottom tower is down.

275
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,080
Tong Yao has a kill,

276
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,740
and is leading in creep score by over ten.

277
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,750
Should the mid and bottom lanes be secure now?

278
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,750
Not necessarily.

279
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,720
Ai Jia is a player

280
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,030
who finds opportunities under pressure.

281
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,950
If you think

282
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,310
you have an advantage

283
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,490
and get a kill mindset,

284
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,600
that's when things go wrong.

285
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,510
No way.

286
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,030
Look.

287
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,070
Smiling uses a skill combo to leave Ai Jia with low health.

288
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,710
Smiling tries a tower dive for a solo kill,

289
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,350
but she's hit by the tower to low health.

290
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,560
Ai Jia fights back with a sliver of health,

291
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
using skill two to knock Smiling up.

292
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,740
Smiling's health is in danger.

293
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,350
Hurry up. Go! Go!

294
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,070
Smiling wants to retreat,

295
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,710
but Xbang suddenly emerges from the side brush.

296
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,590
There's no escape.

297
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,670
Smiling is killed!

298
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,920
There are three great illusions in life:

299
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,810
I have an advantage. I can carry. I can fight this.

300
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,950
Don't be impulsive.

301
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,500
Impulsiveness comes with a price.

302
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,260
Look at him.

303
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,750
He's surpassed you in creep score.

304
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,040
Please don't tell me this hindsight, thank you.

305
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,790
But

306
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,270
when did Ai Jia become so cunning?

307
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,670
It's fine that he squatted on me,

308
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,510
but he even get the jungler to ambush me.

309
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,270
So far in the match,

310
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,230
we can say that Smiling is

311
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,350
having a really tough time.

312
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,630
Not only is she being chased by the enemy mid and jungle,

313
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,310
but now she's being targeted so much she can't even farm.

314
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,070
After five minutes,

315
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,150
her gold is only half of the enemy mid's.

316
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,740
Although Chessman

317
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,770
has a small advantage in creep score,

318
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,950
overall,

319
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,830
he's still under Pope's control.

320
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,470
There is no way to break free.

321
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,660
Yes, it's too bad.

322
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,710
My mid lane is blown.

323
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,710
You top and bottom lanes, hurry up and push the towers.

324
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,350
Pang, go help them.

325
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,800
Okay, I'll defend the tower. Don't worry.

326
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,000
The enemy is at the Octopus. Should we go?

327
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,830
Don't fight, don't take, don't engage.

328
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,550
Focus on macro play and farming.

329
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,770
Okay.

330
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,070
YQCB has started on the Octopus.

331
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,430
They won't come for this.

332
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,180
You knew it.

333
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,230
Smiling needs to farm, not to engage.

334
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,510
Let's push mid

335
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,720
after this Octopus.

336
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,020
Don't let Smiling farm up,

337
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,680
or I'll have a headache later.

338
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,350
Who said before the game

339
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,860
to teach her a lesson?

340
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,110
It wasn't me.

341
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,520
We see YQCB has finished with the Octopus.

342
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,320
If they force to engage now,

343
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,960
they'll be at a disadvantage.

344
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,930
They want to force a team fight.

345
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,990
Clear the minion wave, don't engage.

346
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,750
Oh my god, Smiling has engaged.

347
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,910
We can't fight. Tong Yao, what are you doing?

348
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,110
I got it. We can fight.

349
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,190
We can fight. You go for it.

350
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,390
Fight. Go straight in.

351
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,590
Kill Chessman first.

352
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,910
Pope and Liang Sheng are stunned.

353
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,110
Chessman's Youko enters and ults,

354
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,150
taking down YQCB's bot lane duo.

355
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,510
Xbang uses skill two to displace and freeze four.

356
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,870
Ai Jia ults directly,

357
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,390
hits,

358
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,650
and reaps the harvest!

359
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,630
Only Cat of ZGDX has escaped.

360
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,070
Nice!

361
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,900
YQCB, now

362
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,270
down their bot lane duo,

363
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,470
has actually made a 2 for 4 trade.

364
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,650
Cat, retreat!

365
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,880
I'll run for sure. I'm the only one left.

366
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,180
Nice! This 2 for 4 trade is good.

367
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,000
Good.

368
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,650
This round is very comfortable.

369
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,230
Cheng, I...

370
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,800
What did I tell you before?

371
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,640
Leave it to me.

372
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,030
Play as you like.

373
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,030
Hurry up.

374
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,430
Here I go.

375
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,530
Orochi! Orochi! Orochi!

376
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,820
Let's go grab it!

377
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,830
They're fighting Orochi.

378
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,790
Let's find a chance to get it.

379
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,590
Okay.

380
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,030
Come on

381
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,700
Here I come.

382
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,240
Go!

383
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,640
I'm ready.

384
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,950
We're counting on you, K.

385
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,630
Go, go, go!

386
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,030
Go.

387
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,950
ZGDX

388
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,740
K flanks and follows them secretly.

389
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,510
Cat, Smiling, Pang and Chessman

390
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,990
also chase from the front.

391
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,790
YQCB was caught off guard.

392
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,020
Chessman found a chance

393
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,640
and snatched Orochi!

394
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,490
What's going on?

395
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,390
YQCB is about to be finished in one go.

396
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,180
The last move.

397
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,620
Alone on the high ground.

398
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,750
ZGDX comes with the minion wave.

399
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,150
Rong Rong tried to resist

400
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,320
and was chased by Chessman.

401
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,530
YQCB's high ground falls.

402
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,400
Go, go, go.

403
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,790
ZGDX is at YQCB base.

404
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,250
Ai Jia is still resisting.

405
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,790
Chessman took him down!

406
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,870
YQCB's mid laner Ai Jia is killed instantly. There's Pope.

407
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,710
Can he hold on?

408
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,910
As long as he delays until the other teammates respawn,

409
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,470
there's still a chance!

410
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,990
Watch out, Pope!

411
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,310
Chessman won't give him this chance.

412
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,190
Chessman, triple kill!

413
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,420
Here it comes again.

414
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,990
Come on. Go!

415
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,870
Totally invincible.

416
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,630
ZGDX blew up YQCB's base.

417
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,970
Congratulations to ZGDX for winning this match.

418
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,320
Great!

419
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,790
Yao won!

420
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,480
This is the national champion!

421
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,750
Calm down.

422
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,270
My ears...

423
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,550
It's just the beginning. It's still early.

424
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,590
Besides, in the first round,

425
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,230
her mentality was unstable.

426
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,080
Don't be happy too soon.

427
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,590
The first round.

428
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,930
Are you still nervous?

429
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,320
Let's go.

430
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,380
The much-anticipated

431
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,150
OPL

432
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,920
National Final's second match

433
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,430
is about to begin.

434
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,570
Here, we thank Opple Lighting for their special sponsorship.

435
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,550
Opple Lighting illuminates your comfortable life,

436
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,150
and lights up your championship moments.

437
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,110
By the way,

438
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,150
ZGDX won the first round narrowly,

439
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,660
but Smiling was clearly

440
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,000
suppressed in the early stage.

441
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,830
So we'll see what kind of

442
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,690
shikigami both sides will bring out in this game.

443
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,690
Yes, let's wait and see.

444
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,660
Smiling chose Shiro Mujou.

445
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,950
Is this to compete with Ai Jia to see who's more cowardly?

446
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,230
I bet 10 yuan that she'll lose.

447
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll add 10 yuan.

448
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,870
I'll add 20.

449
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,660
Bah!

450
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,440
What a bunch of jinx.

451
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,570
Pay attention to the mid laner of ZGDX.

452
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,630
Smiling chose Shiro Mujou,

453
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,950
a shikigami she uses less frequently.

454
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,010
She actually chose Shiro Mujou.

455
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,340
It seems this girl has really grown a lot.

456
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,790
Good.

457
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,110
You're amazing.

458
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,850
You're smarter than me.

459
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:34,190
Farm, farm, farm...

460
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,190
Did I hear something wrong? What's that sound?

461
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,590
Are you reciting sutras?

462
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,230
Sis,

463
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,020
what are you muttering?

464
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,080
Be cautious, farm, and don't go wild.

465
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,070
Tong Yao's so fierce when playing games.

466
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,070
You tell her to be cautious, farm, and don't go wild.

467
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,510
That's like putting a cat can in front of

468
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,730
Pancake and telling it not to eat.

469
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,700
K, squat down.

470
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,080
Let me see if I can get a first blood.

471
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,590
Coming.

472
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,030
As we can see,

473
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,910
K is squatting in the brush at the bot lane again.

474
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,030
Don't chase, the enemy jungler should be coming.

475
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,760
We can fight.

476
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,820
K, go!

477
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,240
Go!

478
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
Pope fell for it again.

479
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,830
Congratulations to ZGDX for getting the first blood.

480
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,460
Nice!

481
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,870
As expected, only Chessman

482
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,070
can trick Pope.

483
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,940
It's such a easy trick and Pope fell for it.

484
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,630
There is something going on.

485
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,550
As I said,

486
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,700
Cheng is the only one who can trick Pope.

487
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,340
Yes.

488
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,590
I said the enemy jungler is here, don't engage,

489
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,510
But you still engage, are you stupid?

490
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,470
I can do it.

491
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,860
What can you do?

492
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,500
One versus two and got beaten. Does your face hurt?

493
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,340
Do you hear the sound of being slapped in the face?

494
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,100
Are you really that capable?

495
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,670
Pope has driven

496
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,890
another support crazy today.

497
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,990
Compared to your brother,

498
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,320
your brother is so kind.

499
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,350
Now we can see

500
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,280
K from ZGDX moving to the top lane,

501
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,710
near the river brush.

502
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,310
What's going on?

503
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,120
Ambushing the enemy top, Rong Rong.

504
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,360
They're changing tactics.

505
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,150
But Rong Rong seems

506
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,610
to know K is in the brush,

507
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,350
positioning very cautiously.

508
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,990
In this way, K can't find

509
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,589
a suitable chance to gank.

510
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:07,950
Pang, retreat.

511
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,310
Over here, Xbang's Onikiri appears at the bottom lane.

512
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,470
Chessman seems to have noticed something wrong.

513
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,109
He wants to retreat.

514
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,589
It's too late!

515
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,750
Onikiri uses his third skill to move up,

516
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,310
with its ultimate locking down full-health Chessman.

517
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,390
YQCB's bottom duo, Pope and Liang Sheng,

518
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,920
quickly follow up and swiftly kill Chessman.

519
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,579
Nice!

520
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,349
Nice play, Pope.

521
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,140
This move is good.

522
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,200
I said I could do it.

523
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,790
Look.

524
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,150
They timed it well,

525
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,270
taking advantage of K's absence,

526
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,150
not only getting the kill but also clearing the jungle,

527
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,710
then catching the mid lane.

528
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,030
Well planned.

529
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,270
They probably won't catch the mid lane.

530
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,230
Smiling is too impulsive.

531
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,300
She's trying to actively solo kill Ai Jia,

532
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,750
But she didn't expect

533
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,510
to be schemed by Xbang.

534
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,670
Yes, yes, in this regard, Smiling does seem

535
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,310
not as composed as Lv.

536
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,710
Phone, give me the phone.

537
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,280
Give me the phone.

538
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,470
What for?

539
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,260
How could he say that about my daughter?

540
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,460
I'm going to the square to cheer for Yao.

541
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,760
My mouth is really...

542
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,240
My bad, my bad, I couldn't hold back again.

543
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,140
If we lose later,

544
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,220
I'll hang myself from the southeast branch.

545
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,420
Don't talk nonsense.

546
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,040
Cheng, they're destroying our second tower.

547
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
Cat, Pang, you guard the tower.

548
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,460
K, come with me to steal Orochi.

549
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,260
Okay. Coming.

550
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,080
If we steal Orochi now,

551
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,290
what if...

552
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,970
If we get caught,

553
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,870
the captain will take the blame.

554
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,000
It's true love, indeed.

555
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,110
See? I told you.

556
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,650
ZGDX will lose this match.

557
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,900
If it were me,

558
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,430
I'd go for the Orochi right now.

559
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,230
If they can get the Orochi, there's still a chance.

560
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,290
Otherwise...

561
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,250
Tong Yao, good luck.

562
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,360
Hurry up, Cheng.

563
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,550
Get ready to steal the Orochi.

564
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,370
Rong Rong.

565
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,830
Chessman and K are going to fight Orochi.

566
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,150
If he takes down Orochi,

567
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,830
they might be able to turn the tide.

568
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,990
But YQCB is already heading to the snake pit.

569
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,420
Orochi's almost done!

570
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,590
The other three of ZGDX

571
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,430
are on their way to support.

572
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,290
Can they get it?

573
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,040
YQCB enters. Five against two.

574
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,890
Chessman and K are surrounded this time.

575
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,740
Yes, it's hard to escape.

576
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,820
Chessman and K were taken down.

577
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,870
-Orochi was snatched away.
-You won't watch it?

578
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,270
-What a pity!
-It's over.

579
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,630
No.

580
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,510
It's too late.

581
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,550
Look.

582
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,540
There's still...

583
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,430
The ZGDX trio was also caught up by YQCB.

584
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,990
Keep watching, keep watching.

585
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,030
Wiped out.

586
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,310
Pope!

587
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,480
Nice!

588
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,820
Nice!

589
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,360
YQCB starts pushing the base.

590
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,990
The battle is decided.

591
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,830
YQCB is worthy.

592
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,530
This is the level of the finals.

593
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,640
YQCB played incredibly well in this match.

594
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,470
Congratulations to Team YQCB for tying up the score.

595
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,870
What's wrong?

596
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,820
Worried about me being hung on the wall?

597
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,580
Do you remember what I said

598
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,700
when you first came?

599
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,550
Cheng.

600
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,310
Which time?

601
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,260
You've said so many things to me.

602
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,620
I need to look up for it.

603
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,190
That time at the supermarket, remember?

604
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,360
In esports, being bad at the game is the original sin.

605
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,790
In esports, being bad at the game is the original sin.

606
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,180
So we must win the next round.

607
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,970
Let's go.

608
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,420
Let's go.

609
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,430
Last round. Fighting.

610
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,030
Okay.

611
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,890
I'll fight so hard you'll end up

612
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,890
crying in the arms of your mid laner.

613
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,800
If you insist on putting it that way,

614
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,110
I still miss you crying in the arms of

615
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,640
your support when you lost.

616
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,080
See you on the field.

617
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,540
All the best, Chessman.

618
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,180
All the best.

619
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,690
Light.

620
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,590
Welcome back.

621
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,870
This is the live broadcast of Onmyoji Arena

622
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,950
2020 Final Game.

623
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,870
The competing teams are ZGDX and YQCB.

624
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,220
Now the score is 1:1.

625
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,800
Both teams have lived up to expectations and tied the score.

626
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,190
What's about to start is

627
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,670
today's decisive battle,

628
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,900
the Tennouzan match.

629
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,270
Alright, we can see that

630
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,340
both teams are ready

631
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,080
in front of their computers.

632
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,120
The match is about to enter the ban and pick phase.

633
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,450
Still banning Tamamonomae?

634
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,920
Tamamonomae must be banned.

635
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,730
Ai Jia insists on banning Tamamonomae.

636
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,760
Okay.

637
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,450
Tong Yao's title, No. 1 Tamamonomae player in China,

638
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,930
seems to be intimidating.

639
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,250
Susabi and Menreiki are banned.

640
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,450
ZGDX banned a mid laner too.

641
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,640
Are they crazy?

642
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,230
What are they thinking?

643
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,960
Next, YQCB

644
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,660
banned Susabi and Menreiki.

645
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,910
Menreiki is banned.

646
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,920
This ban is really bold.

647
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,150
Kiyohime and Higanbana are banned.

648
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,440
Okay.

649
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
So now it's the pick phase.

650
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,110
Let's see both sides will choose...

651
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,870
God Yang.

652
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,660
God Yang.

653
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,190
The third match is about to start. Are you watching?

654
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,750
Cat, is Ibaraki Doji okay?

655
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,430
Okay.

656
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,140
K, choose Kuro for Pang.

657
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,350
Okay.

658
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,940
Coach, I'll choose Shuten Doji.

659
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,450
Okay.

660
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,880
Pope, what do you use?

661
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,730
Get me Hakuro. It's more safe.

662
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,440
Okay.

663
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,550
Good.

664
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,710
Cheng, you can choose Chin this time.

665
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,600
Get me Mannendake.

666
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,890
Okay. As we can see,

667
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,500
both sides have

668
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,560
made basic picks.

669
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:00,910
Yes.

670
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,000
For YQCB,

671
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,890
there's top laner with Shuten Doji,

672
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,050
with a strong burst.

673
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,850
Mid laner with Ootengu.

674
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,360
Jungler with Mannendake.

675
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,790
Support with Ichimokuren.

676
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,070
ADC with Hakuro.

677
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,110
Overall, it looks like

678
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,570
a relatively safe combination.

679
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,330
That's right. And for ZGDX,

680
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,030
except for Smiling who hasn't confirmed the final shikigami,

681
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,510
the other four players

682
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,000
have already chosen their shikigami.

683
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,760
We can see that Cat's top lane

684
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,310
has taken the CP of the opposing Shuten Doji,

685
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,400
Ibaraki Doji.

686
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,860
Yes.

687
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,310
The jungler K got Yasha.

688
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,830
ADC Chessman got Chin.

689
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,010
And support Pang got Kuro.

690
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,010
Let's see who Smiling will

691
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,190
bring out today.

692
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,430
Pang, choose Onikiri for Tong Yao.

693
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,430
Onikiri!

694
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,910
My goodness.

695
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,420
Smiling actually picked Onikiri.

696
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,150
The last time Team ZGDX

697
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,510
played against YQCB,

698
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,190
Smiling also picked Onikiri.

699
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,670
Yes.

700
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,990
If I remember correctly,

701
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,150
she lost the match last time.

702
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,750
Yes, I guess today Smiling

703
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,430
wants to take revenge.

704
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,870
Yes, I think YQCB

705
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,830
is thinking the same way.

706
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,230
Look,

707
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,390
all the players don't look too happy.

708
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,640
They're probably thinking,

709
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,110
what are you doing?

710
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,330
I've gone through all this trouble to ban three of your shikigami,

711
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,930
and you pull out an Onikiri to play tricks on me.

712
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,390
Am I playing a fake final?

713
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,360
Real or fake, let's wait and see.

714
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,580
Okay, let's go for it!

715
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,830
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

716
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,400
Go for it!

717
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,710
Smiling's Onikiri is being suppressed hard by Ai Jia.

718
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,670
I can catch Tong Yao here.

719
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,240
Okay, mid lane, I'm coming.

720
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,990
Xbang has also arrived at mid lane,

721
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,190
preparing for a gank.

722
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,870
The atmosphere here at mid-lane is a bit tense now.

723
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,350
Smiling is hiding under the tower,

724
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,400
not daring to leave under Ai Jia's attack.

725
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,880
Yeah.

726
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,940
Tong Yao, let me help you this time.

727
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,990
Come on, Cat.

728
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,980
Be careful, you two.

729
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,910
Okay, I'm going.

730
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,390
Xbang is in too.

731
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,080
Smiling uses her third skill to dash right at Ai Jia's face.

732
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,950
Smiling is controlled.

733
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,170
Cat rushes out just in time,

734
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,510
coordinating with Smiling to take down Ai Jia.

735
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,550
Xbang tries to trade with Smiling,

736
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,110
but Smiling uses blink to create distance.

737
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,400
Cat takes out Xbang just in time.

738
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,110
Zero for two.

739
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,980
Nice!

740
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,890
Nice.

741
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,670
Nice.

742
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,200
Ai Jia and Xbang failed to catch Smiling,

743
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,960
and were counter-killed by Cat and Smiling.

744
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,450
Let's take the Octopus.

745
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,540
Alright, Cheng, I'm coming.

746
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,270
I'm in position.

747
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,310
ZGDX is leading with two kills over the enemy.

748
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,370
We see they're fighting the Octopus.

749
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,350
Okay, they've got the Octopus too.

750
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,740
If I were the audience,

751
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,500
I would have gone to the bathroom three times now.

752
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,450
Are you having kidney problems?

753
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,960
Young people need to know moderation.

754
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,330
I didn't do anything.

755
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,200
You can ask her what she's been up to.

756
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,480
Lu Sicheng!

757
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,350
There are so many people backstage listening.

758
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,730
Can you please shut up?

759
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,510
Backstage guys,

760
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,830
this can't get out.

761
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,600
I don't want to receive any more

762
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,140
dead cockroaches or dead rats.

763
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,420
And there are many minors among the fans.

764
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,670
Why are you laughing? They're fighting Orochi!

765
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,550
Come and help!

766
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,150
Who will protect you if I die?

767
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,100
Coming.

768
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,590
You're always yelling.

769
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,930
This match is taking a bit long.

770
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,830
I'm worried about my brother's hand.

771
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,430
And YQCB's whole team has arrived at the snake pit,

772
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,450
destroying the Orochi.

773
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,230
They're about to take it down!

774
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,910
Why aren't they attacking? What are they waiting for?

775
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,670
No rush.

776
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,570
Can ZGDX still sit tight now?

777
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,980
Orochi's HP is down to a quarter!

778
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,820
Now's the time to strike.

779
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,950
Almost there, almost there, almost there.

780
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,670
Let's wait.

781
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,360
Ready.

782
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,390
Go! Go!

783
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,030
Go!

784
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,850
K rushed over!

785
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,710
Just as YQCB is about to finish off

786
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,260
the last bit of health on the Orochi,

787
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,020
K dashes out from the bush!

788
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,110
Pressing the advantage.

789
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,620
Okay.

790
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,450
The cooked duck flew away.

791
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,790
Xbang must be very angry.

792
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,160
Team ZGDX did a good job stealing the Orochi.

793
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Where's God Yang?

794
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,900
Isn't he watching?

795
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,590
Actually, at first,

796
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,490
I didn't expect her to play this well.

797
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,020
I've seen her from the group stage...

798
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,780
Over there.

799
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,350
And now seeing her

800
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,870
shining on stage,

801
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,210
I'm also very happy.

802
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,750
I mean it.

803
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,090
Although one year ago,

804
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,910
I would never have imagined

805
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,630
her shaking my hand as an opponent.

806
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,690
Cheng is lucky.

807
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,220
He's Cheng after all.

808
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,710
If I were a woman,

809
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,440
I would like him too.

810
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,110
No problem.

811
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,070
Really.

812
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,950
I mean it.

813
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,730
Wish them all the best.

814
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,150
Of course there's a bit of jealousy.

815
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,070
After all, teaching an apprentice starves the master.

816
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,020
The apprentice is going for the championship,

817
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,020
but the master has been eliminated.

818
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
But blessings are still important.

819
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,240
This match has lasted for 50 minutes,

820
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,280
at a time point when everyone wants to go to the toilet.

821
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,470
Let me interview

822
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,270
Lu Sicheng, who has a hand injury.

823
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,360
Does your hand hurt?

824
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,960
It's okay.

825
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,720
It's just that after playing for so long, if we lose,

826
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,910
I would be very unhappy.

827
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,940
I can't take it anymore.

828
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,920
Even thinking about this being the final,

829
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,180
even thinking about the world championship tickets,

830
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,640
even thinking about the free overseas trip,

831
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,340
I still can't take it.

832
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,400
I'm too sleepy.

833
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,100
Seriously,

834
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,270
I'm so sleepy too.

835
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,520
I can count the games

836
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,730
I've played in my career that

837
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,290
lasted over 40 minutes on one hand.

838
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,570
Now, winning is not about strength,

839
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,790
it's about willpower.

840
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,510
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

841
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,710
Just 10 more minutes.

842
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,510
If we lose this, I'll lose my mind.

843
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,580
Next game, I'm going all out, no matter what.

844
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,900
It's all or nothing.

845
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,740
Come on, Pang.

846
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Let's sing a song.

847
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,500
Sing the song of war.

848
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,450
One, two, three.

849
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,910
Come on, make the most of it.

850
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,650
We've got plenty of time.

851
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,200
What kind of behavior is this?

852
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,420
Come on, love.

853
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,110
We've got plenty of foolishness.

854
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,930
Come on, wander.

855
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,830
We've got plenty of directions.

856
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,060
Come on, make the most of it.

857
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,290
We've got plenty of scenery.

858
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,990
I really didn't expect that

859
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,710
the battle song of ZGDX that I've always dreamed of joining

860
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,140
would be this one.

861
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,350
You also didn't expect that one day

862
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,730
you'd charge into a team fight with your teammates'

863
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,250
enchanting singing, did you?

864
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,120
What do you think?

865
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,990
Here's our chance. Go!

866
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,630
-Go!
-Go!

867
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,950
ZGDX takes the minion wave

868
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,470
and rushes into YQCB's high ground,

869
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,590
forcing the tower!

870
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,070
Can YQCB hold on?

871
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,070
The fight has begun!

872
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,670
The situation is intense!

873
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,070
Pang, cover me, cover me.

874
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,790
It's okay, it's okay, I'll tank.

875
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,070
No status, fall back.

876
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,750
Pope's HP is not looking good now.

877
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,550
You take out the AD first.

878
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,150
Cheng, watch your position.

879
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,070
At this moment, Smiling was focused down by Pope

880
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,660
to low health and taken out!

881
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,230
I have to compliment Pope,

882
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,750
this world-class AD

883
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,150
has a unique strength.

884
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,790
Xbang is low health. Pope is low health.

885
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,650
Cheng, go for the harvest!

886
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,150
Leave it to me.

887
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,550
Xbang is also low health.

888
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,220
Xbang with low health is harvested by Chessman.

889
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,270
Pang couldn't hold on and was taken out.

890
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,620
-Chessman is still dealing damage.
-Pang, you really are...

891
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,750
Can he take out Pope?

892
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,030
Nice, Pope is also taken out.

893
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,550
Nice! We can do this.

894
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,390
Go on, go on.

895
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,460
I can't, I'm low health.

896
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,620
Chessman is low health.

897
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,950
Ai Jia seizes the opportunity to harvest.

898
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,780
YQCB is great!

899
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,200
Good luck, Smiling.

900
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,910
Cat, retreat, go back to the high ground.

901
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,870
Retreat now!

902
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,730
Okay, let's go.

903
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,160
Push forward. Push forward.

904
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,300
Push! Push! Push! Come on!

905
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,830
Why are there so many minions at home?

906
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,290
Clear the minions first, ignore them.

907
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,260
Our defense tower needs support.

908
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,110
K, what are you doing? Clear minions!

909
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,830
I'm clearing. Look at my HP.

910
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,430
Hold on, hold on, until Tong Yao respawns.

911
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,820
Hold on, I have 10 seconds until I respawn.

912
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,070
Is it time for a final push?

913
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,750
Nine seconds left until Smiling respawns.

914
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,470
Let's see if they can turn the tide.

915
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,470
I'm out of health!

916
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,150
Eight.

917
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,270
Seven.

918
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,130
Six.

919
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,710
Five.

920
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,990
Four.

921
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,880
Three!

922
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,830
Two!

923
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,630
One!

924
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,840
Smiling respawns!

925
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,520
Yes!

926
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,210
Come on, girl.

927
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,150
Smiling rushed over,

928
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,220
rapidly approaching the low health Ootengu.

929
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,600
A normal attack plus decay.

930
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
A skill combo takes out Ai Jia!

931
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,390
Kill, that's it, kill.

932
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,790
Come on, Pang, tank first, I'll get the kill.

933
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,640
I'm coming.

934
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,570
I'll cover, I'll cover. Go, go, go!

935
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,810
Triple kill!

936
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,400
Nice!

937
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,870
Smiling respawns at the last moment and gets a triple kill!

938
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,670
Yes! Nice!

939
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,840
We have a chance. Wait for my respawn.

940
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,720
Cheng, Tong Yao, you can do this!

941
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,740
Lu Sicheng respawned!

942
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,310
It's going to turn the tide!

943
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,080
Tong Yao, follow me to the high ground.

944
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,520
Okay.

945
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,960
Chessman and Smiling are rushing towards the enemy's high ground.

946
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,080
E-sports' divine couple.

947
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,290
Diao Chan and Lv Bu.

948
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,280
Huang Rong and Guo Jing.

949
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,300
Come on! Come on!

950
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,130
Cheng, Pope is about to respawn.

951
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,230
Pope respawns.

952
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,110
Let's see if Pope can withstand their attack

953
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,270
and make a nice counterattack.

954
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,590
Leave Pope to me.

955
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,429
Tong Yao, you flank and push the base directly.

956
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:41,870
Okay.

957
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,230
I'll hold off Pope.

958
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,050
Now! Go!

959
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,790
Nice!

960
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,270
Chessman's revenge battle.

961
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,470
Perfect interception.

962
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,190
It's really so exciting!

963
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,350
Well done, Tong Yao!

964
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,870
It's really a Light and Shadow battle.

965
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,650
Push!

966
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,100
Go, sis! Go, sis!

967
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,070
Stay calm, Tong Yao.

968
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,310
Ignore it! Just push!

969
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,580
Smiling, come on!

970
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,230
Five seconds left.

971
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,920
YQCB's players are about to respawn.

972
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,750
Let's see if Smiling can live up to expectations

973
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,720
and win the final victory.

974
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,060
There have been too many twists today.

975
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,860
It's really hard to predict the outcome without seeing it to the end.

976
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:26,970
Sis,

977
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,950
come on.

978
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,690
Respawned! Hold on!

979
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,870
Go!

980
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,790
Nice!

981
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,480
Congratulations to Team ZGDX. Congratulations!

982
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,430
The regret of the Spring Tournament

983
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,200
is finally made up for tonight.

984
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,070
This is the glory of ZGDX!

985
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,590
The OPL National Final's

986
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,500
champion, Team ZGDX!

987
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,440
Let's congratulate the Team ZGDX

988
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,590
with the biggest applause.

989
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,140
ZGDX!

990
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,470
ZGDX!

991
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,100
We won.

992
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,190
Yao won! Yao is the national champion!

993
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,140
Hubby, Yao won!

994
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,180
Champion?

995
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,110
-National champion?
-Yeah.

996
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,430
-Yao won! Hubby.
-Champion!

997
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,160
-National champion!
-Yao won.

998
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,400
Our daughter is the national champion, Hubby!

999
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,960
Honey, you haven't kissed me for a long time.

1000
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,030
One more kiss! One more!

1001
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,350
You wish!

1002
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,260
Smiling!

1003
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,120
Smiling!

1004
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,190
Smiling!

1005
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,680
Smiling!

1006
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,550
Listen, Smiling is still good.

1007
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,610
Still good. Cool.

1008
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,070
-Smiling is the best.
-Great.

1009
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,000
It's really amazing. She's great.

1010
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,230
Smiling is amazing.

1011
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,610
I taught her.

1012
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,310
I taught her.

1013
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,270
I know. You taught her.

1014
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,820
-I got goose bumps.
-I taught her.

1015
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,670
Smiling is the best.

1016
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,590
-Cheers.
-She's better than you, better than you.

1017
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,250
Cool, cool, really cool.

1018
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,310
We are the champion! We are the champion!

1019
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,110
We won! We are the champion!

1020
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,710
We won!

1021
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,800
I didn't expect that we still lost.

1022
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,910
Congratulations, Chessman.

1023
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,180
Light.

1024
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,630
Thank you.

1025
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,370
Congratulations.

1026
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,170
I didn't expect you to be so good.

1027
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,880
Well played. Congratulations.

1028
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,290
It's not embarrassing to lose to me.

1029
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,090
ZGDX!

1030
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,890
Ai Jia, I love you!

1031
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,070
ZGDX!

1032
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:58,130
Kiss!

1033
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,930
One, two, three.

1034
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,760
We are the champion!

1035
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,040
After ZGDX won the national final,

1036
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,260
they've started to actively prepare for the world championship.

1037
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,630
As for the ZGDX's double C that everyone is concerned about,

1038
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,590
I heard they went to

1039
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,620
the next-door mid laner's wedding.

1040
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,250
[ZGDX's double C are engaged?]

1041
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,890
Esports Farm never spreads false gossip.

1042
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,790
I know you'll keep following me.

1043
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,670
See you next year.
