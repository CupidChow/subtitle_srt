1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,390
Why are you hiding here crying alone?

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,750
Is it because you lost the match?

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,910
I was already upset about losing.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,230
Then I saw the Esports Farm comments

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,490
that were all so harsh.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,020
I wanted to grab each one of them and tell them

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,880
that I really had no other choice.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,060
I'll do better next time with better preparation.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,440
But there won't be a next time.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,140
You know they just praise the winners and insult the losers.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,940
Why do you still take it to heart?

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,700
Because they used to say I led the team to victory.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,100
This feeling is quite familiar.

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,450
No team ever defeats another team

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,740
with ease.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,610
Who knows how much work was done behind the scenes

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,220
before one can seemingly defeat others effortlessly?

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,420
We're all human.

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,860
No one can be as powerful

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,590
as an extraterrestrial being.

21
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,820
So,

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,880
never underestimate your opponents.

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,580
Don't fight a battle you're not prepared for.

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,370
Cheng.

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,800
I want to challenge Tai to another match.

26
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,060
Not scared anymore?

27
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,710
[Falling into your smile]

28
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,449
[Episode 14]

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm going to the restroom.

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
Didn't you just go?

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,230
Scared?

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,770
What are you saying?

33
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,070
Tong Yao, don't feel pressured.

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,090
We know how hard you've been working.

35
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,420
I should be the one feeling pressured now—

36
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,340
It's okay, Tong Yao. Just do your best.

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,940
I'll handle the higher-ups.

38
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,050
She's obviously panicking,

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,060
yet you're telling her to relax?

40
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,710
Don't run your mouth without understanding the situation.

41
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,370
I'm not nervous.

42
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,100
Really.

43
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,840
My heart isn't racing at all.

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,800
Your mental resilience is worrying.

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,630
That's why

46
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,540
you should try to take a page out of Lu Yue's playbook.

47
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,730
Steady as an experienced driver

48
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,140
and more defensive than a defense tower.

49
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,680
Stay relaxed and wait for your teammates to take action

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,690
to freeload on their success.

51
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,950
Never carry the team if you don't have to.

52
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,240
Come back.

53
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,040
The match's starting.

54
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,310
Where's my cursor?

55
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,530
I can't find my cursor.

56
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,500
Where is it?

57
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,010
It's here.

58
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,060
See it here?

59
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,790
It appeared again.

60
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,350
Why are your hands so cold?

61
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,070
I just washed my hands with cold water.

62
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,900
This isn't make or break.

63
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,710
Why are you so nervous?

64
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,450
You were so fierce when you challenged him,

65
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,579
full of confidence.

66
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,050
Are you trying to comfort me?

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,770
Close your eyes.

68
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,400
Take a deep breath.

69
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,550
Play relaxed.

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,300
It's okay if you can't win.

71
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,250
I'll lead you to victory.

72
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Did you hear that?

73
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,610
Cheng said,

74
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,370
"If you can't win, I'll lead you to victory."

75
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,740
Like a normal guy

76
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,940
talking to our Sis.

77
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,010
I'm actually even a bit moved.

78
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,850
Hearing such words coming out

79
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,470
of his mouth

80
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,970
is like achieving nirvana.

81
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,910
You two are really something else.

82
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,380
During the monthly evaluation,

83
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,840
when you were on your knees

84
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,640
begging our captain to carry you to victory,

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,170
why didn't you say he wasn't a normal man then?

86
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,940
Let's start.

87
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,140
Tong Yao, we have the first pick.

88
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,020
Do you want to take Tamamonomae?

89
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,630
I'll still take Higanbana.

90
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,370
Okay.

91
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,360
Go.

92
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,690
The minion wave is about to reach the tower.

93
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,390
K just helped you with a gank and you're still hesitating?

94
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,050
Can't even leave the tower because Tai's there?

95
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,200
Five minutes in, 0-0-0.

96
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,130
And you're still 300 behind them on gold.

97
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,450
Mid laner, are you disconnected?

98
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,630
You're so full of yourself today.

99
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,470
Stop talking.

100
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,159
Orochi is about to respawn.

101
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,600
The gold is about even for both sides.

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,700
Taking Orochi should give us an advantage.

103
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,430
K, go check out their activity.

104
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,580
Okay.

105
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,370
If those two aren't going for Orochi,

106
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,830
why are they camping here?

107
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,470
Who're they trying to scare?

108
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,810
Wait for me.

109
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,690
Tai is coming!

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,740
Did you even see a shadow before using blink?

111
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,450
You ran faster than a bat out of hell.

112
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,710
If I didn't run, I'd have died.

113
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,840
What do you mean die?

114
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,450
Come on.

115
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,690
After we take Orochi, let's find a chance to fight.

116
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,590
It's okay if you can't win.

117
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,190
I'll get a kill back for you.

118
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,060
Pang!

119
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,290
Is the Support mine or yours?

120
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,300
Quit being a wimp

121
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
or even Cat will have to protect you.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,580
With Higanbana,

123
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,510
you're really playing like Lu Yue.

124
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,540
I'm going in.

125
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,700
Why are you still hiding

126
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,500
when the jungler has gone in to sacrifice himself?

127
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,110
Come back.

128
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,570
Don't be scared. I'm here.

129
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,840
Pang is down.

130
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,370
We're in bad shape. Let's retreat.

131
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,630
Cat is coming to support. Don't be scared.

132
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,980
Stay behind and keep dealing damage.

133
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,100
Go, go, go!

134
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,240
If we win this team fight, we can push directly.

135
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,160
Don't hide when you see Tamamonomae.

136

-Cat, hang in there.
-Cat, hang in there.

137
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Tong Yao, come quickly and clean up!

138
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,790
No, no, I'm crowd controlled!

139
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,490
You can fight.

140
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,630
Tai needs to go back and clear minions.

141
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,220
I'll recall and wait for you to respawn.

142
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,080
Push directly.

143
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,480
One on one. Show me what you've got.

144
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,110
Don't rush.

145
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,600
It's okay if we lose.

146
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,260
That's right, Sis.

147
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,240
Worst-case scenario, we'll fight again next game.

148
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,930
Who knows

149
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,060
how much work was done behind the scenes

150
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,920
before one can seemingly defeat others effortlessly?

151

Never underestimate your opponents.

-Wow! Yeah!
-Sis! Nice!

156
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,150
Well played.

157
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,010
It seemed easier than we imagined,

158
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,770
right?

159
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,050
Yes.

160
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,610
They weren't as invincible as the rumors say, huh?

161
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,290
Exactly.

162
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,310
They weren't targeting you in the first place.

163
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,890
You played very well.

164
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,320
Your recent training's been effective.

165
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,780
Actually, today's success was thanks to everyone.

166
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,930
I just got carried.

167
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
You're too humble.

168
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,250
Getting carried?

169
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,920
This is called having teammates.

170
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,640
Hey, guys.

171
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,840
Why aren't you all this nice to me?

172
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,230
Your skin is so thick.

173
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,820
Why should we be nice to you?

174
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,990
I still have to work harder from now on.

175
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,850
I'll strive to solo-kill him soon.

176
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,980
Getting cocky, huh?

177
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,190
But it's within acceptable limits.

178
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,270
Today's practice match

179
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,770
is a milestone victory for Tong Yao.

180
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,650
So I propose

181
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,610
we all go out for a nice meal together!

182
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:46,900
Yes!

183
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,050
Yes, yes. Great idea.

184
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,420
-The club will pay the bill. Let’s go.
-Yes!

185
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,780
W-Who said the club is paying?

186
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,860
Alright. Alright.

187
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,640
Rui's treating us!

188
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,650
If every professional player

189
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,740
has to go through their darkest hour,

190
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,200
then

191
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,680
from the moment I defeated Tai,

192
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,270
this experience

193
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,970
has already become a part of my armor.

194
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,500
It constantly reminds me

195
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,110
that a professional player's faith

196
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,360
never fades.

197
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,350
How about establishing a new belief

198
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,080
with the determination to win?

199
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,020
Go for it.

200
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,840
Pang, do these shoes look good?

201
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,820
They're so ugly.

202
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,610
Let me see.

203
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,260
But she's very strong

204
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,200
and has a serious attitude.

205
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,820
As the team captain, I'm very happy

206
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,150
to have such a teammate.

207
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,550
With her joining,

208
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
this summer,

209
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,570
ZGDX will become unprecedentedly strong.

210
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,380
What a perfect match!

211
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,610
Truly a match made in heaven!

212
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,470
Even Cheng's lips are curling up.

213
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,840
I bet they're close.

214
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,589
Cheng, praise me too!

215
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,619
I love Cheng when he's like this.

216
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,650
Hah, how stupid.

217
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,970
I'll always support you.

218
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,730
Cheng is truly an amazing man.

219
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,160
ZGDX will become unprecedentedly strong.

220
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,319
He was really smiling.

221
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,970
Rui! Rui!

222
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,730
What's up?

223
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,170
Do you need to use the restroom?

224
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,099
Can't hold it in?

225
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,310
-Sir!
-No, no.

226
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,180
Rui, look at this.

227
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,820
What? Getting online hate again?

228
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,020
But she's very strong

229
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,750
and has a serious attitude.

230
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,200
As the team captain, I'm very happy to have such a teammate.

231
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,050
With her joining...

232
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,970
Give me back my phone.

233
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,610
Isn't this an old interview?

234
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,120
It's been so long. What are you fussing about?

235
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,850
Rui and I were watching a video.

236
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,340
You were praising me.

237
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,470
What's wrong with that?

238
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,340
The interview outline was written by the staff.

239
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,210
I just read from it.

240
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,010
If you don't believe me, ask Rui.

241
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,130
Is that true, Rui?

242
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,940
It's fake.

243
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,290
That little note only had questions on it.

244
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,490
Who'd dare to teach

245
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,620
Lu Sicheng how to respond to the press?

246
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,160
Give me back my phone.

247
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,710
Nope.

248
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,290
Give it back.

249
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,780
Nope, I won't.

250
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,630
Give it to me.

251
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,150
Nope.

252
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,180
What are you doing?

253
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,690
Cheating on your behalf.

254
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,110
What cheating?

255
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,990
What's going on?

256
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,250
Yeah, what's going on?

257
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,940
Delete it.

258
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,950
You need to have long arms to be a hero

259
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,360
saving a damsel in distress.

260
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,560
Caring for small animals is a virtue.

261
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,640
Who are you calling a small animal?

262
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:17,780
Lu Yue.

263
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,060
Who did you send that photo to?

264
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,810
Don't tell me you posted it online.

265
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,770
Oh, come on.

266
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,820
I'm not that low.

267
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,680
You're even lower than you think.

268
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,210
When someone was being interviewed,

269
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,470
his eyes were sparkling and he couldn't stop praising her.

270
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,450
This needs to be flipped.

271
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,910
Oh my, is my grilled meat ready yet?

272
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,820
I'm starving!

273
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,460
Exactly.

274
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,970
-Don't rush us!
-Don't rush us!

275
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,980
All you know is eating.

276
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,730
I'll bring it over.

277
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,980
Okay, go ahead.

278
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,790
I told you I'd grill it. So slow.

279
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,700
Thank you.

280
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,740
Is it good?

281
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,240
Who asked you to meddle earlier?

282
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,590
Your sister-in-law called, huh?

283
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,790
What sister-in-law?

284
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,860
[Mrs. Lu]

285
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,210
Oh, this?

286
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,360
You answer it.

287
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,280
You're just stirring up trouble, you little brat.

288
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,160
Give me some too.

289
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,280
Cheng, your phone's been ringing for a while.

290
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,090
Who is it?

291
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,200
It seems to be your girlfriend.

292
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,850
Mrs. Lu.

293
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,340
I didn't mean to look.

294
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,100
Shut up.

295
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,600
It's not that Mrs. Lu.

296
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,500
Hello?

297
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,210
What are you doing?

298
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,930
I've called so many times. Why didn't you pick up?

299
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,820
What's so important that you can't...

300
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,410
Slow down. What's the rush?

301
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,540
Speak clearly.

302
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,420
Weren't you in a meeting?

303
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,470
How did you sneak out?

304
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,270
You're so reckless. Is your company going bankrupt?

305
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,560
The tone is intimate.

306
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,300
It's like complaining but not really complaining.

307
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,660
It's an indulgent tone.

308
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,800
It's definitely his girlfriend.

309
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,900
Why can't I praise my teammate?

310
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,810
What's wrong with me praising her for playing well?

311
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,450
I'm going to the restroom. You guys eat up.

312
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,090
Cheng.

313
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,350
What is it?

314
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,660
I don't know

315
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,600
who will be lucky enough to become the future Mrs. Lu,

316
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,620
but I'm starting

317
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,010
to envy her a little.

318
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,110
Because you'll protect her so well,

319
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,530
keeping her safe from any harm.

320
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,100
Cheng.

321
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,540
Do you have a girlfriend?

322
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,020
What's wrong with you?

323
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,700
What's with the long face? Are you jealous?

324
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,940
Come to your senses. You're not worthy.

325
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:28,960
Done.

326
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,470
It must look good.

327
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,690
What?

328
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,800
You came to Shenzhen?

329
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,610
Why did you come?

330
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,070
The national league has started.

331
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,560
I don't have time to fool around with you.

332
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Fool around? Didn't Lu Yue tell you?

333
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,380
I've heard nothing from him.

334
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,130
If you want to see him or get him to go back,

335
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,430
contact him yourself.

336
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,030
Don't always use running away from home

337
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,230
to scare me, okay?

338
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,470
Are you okay?

339
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,610
My mom.

340
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,070
Okay, got it.

341
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,810
I'll grill. What do you want to eat?

342
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,030
Do you know how to grill?

343
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,110
Of course.

344
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,490
Fine, let's go. Let her grill.

345
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,280
It's all yours.

346
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,940
Delicious.

347
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,320
Did you find money? You look so happy.

348
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,340
Let's go, let's go.

349
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,460
Do you want some?

350
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,780
-Are you done?
-Do you want some?

351
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,250
Here.

352
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,500
Thank you.

353
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,840
Why aren't you eating anymore?

354
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,440
I'll get fat if I eat too much.

355
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,320
It's so yummy.

356
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,680
[Mrs. Lu]

357
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,990
Lu Yue.

358
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,560
I think you've poked a hornet's nest.

359
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,670
If this affects Cheng's gaming condition,

360
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,730
I'll dock your pay.

361
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,460
You'll never be able to understand

362
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,450
the feelings of a middle-aged woman

363
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,590
who has a handsome son of marriageable age

364
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,270
but doesn't even have a girlfriend.

365
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,480
But suddenly one day,

366
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
when she finally feels there's hope

367
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,820
and then that hope is quickly shattered,

368
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,620
that would be truly disastrous.

369
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,480
[Mrs. Wang]

370
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,240
Hello?

371
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,210
Bro, it's for you.

372
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,860
Blind date?

373
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,140
What blind date?

374
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,340
Don't you think you sound a bit crazy?

375
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,290
I have a match next week.

376
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,580
I have practice matches every day.

377
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,440
I don't have time for blind dates.

378
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,300
I don't care if she's pretty.

379
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
A well-bred lady?

380
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,140
What does "well-bred lady" even mean?

381
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,580
Doesn't disturb my practice matches,

382
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
doesn't disturb my gaming,

383
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,930
doesn't mess around online,

384
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,330
doesn't demand to meet on every holiday,

385
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,960
and so quiet like she doesn't exist?

386
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,680
Is that it?

387
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,540
If that's the case, I'll accept.

388
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,630
Cheng.

389
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
A well-bred lady?

390
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,930
I like that.

391
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,380
You haven't even figured out the game,

392
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,020
yet you're always thinking about dating?

393
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
So what?

394
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,410
Is that good?

395
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,270
Even electronic pets vibrate when they're hungry.

396
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,200
I'm an obtuse straight man.

397
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,220
Isn't this good?

398
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,040
You also don't have to worry about my sexual orientation.

399
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,300
A straight man who doesn't like women is even scarier!

400
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,360
How can you just...

401
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,490
Why don't you just admit

402
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,250
that you're involved with that shorty?

403
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,630
She doesn't know anyway.

404
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,230
It's fine.

405
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,700
About Mrs. Wang,

406
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,630
leave it to me.

407
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,180
Hey, Mom.

408
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,740
It's me.

409
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,320
Mom, don't mess around.

410
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,490
Someone of my brother's caliber

411
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,810
can just wave his hand

412
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,920
and have a bunch of women lining up for him.

413
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,730
He doesn't need blind dates.

414
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,490
This year is very important for our team.

415
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,890
We're very busy.

416
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,490
And whether we can win the championship

417
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,690
depends on this year.

418
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,900
You're right.

419
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,650
My brother is at the age for blind dates.

420
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,660
I'll talk to him again for you.

421
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,370
My mom said if I say one more word,

422
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,530
she'll also arrange

423
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,890
blind dates for me.

424
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,340
I'm only 23.

425
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,060
I can't sacrifice my youth

426
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,720
for our great brotherly bond.

427
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,140
Enjoy your blind date.

428
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,700
I heard she's beautiful

429
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,440
and of the same age as you, called Su Luo.

430
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,810
She just returned from studying in England.

431
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,570
And her family

432
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,420
has business connections with ours.

433
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,770
I believe you two will be

434
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,530
a perfect match made in heaven.

435
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,560
Bro, don't look at me like that.

436
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,080
This isn't the first time

437
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,540
I've betrayed you anyway.

438
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,660
Bro, don't be angry!

439
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,660
Hello, Mom.

440
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:24,820
Here.

441
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,080
Eat this and he won't be angry anymore.

442
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,060
So,

443
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,640
your brother is really going on a blind date?

444
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,780
The blind date is just a formality.

445
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,380
Once Mrs. Wang's set on something,

446
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,710
it's unlikely anyone can change her mind.

447
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,410
But if she really is

448
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,870
a sensible, beautiful, and well-bred lady,

449
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,600
dating her would be better than

450
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,370
him being like a robot all day, right?

451
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,130
He might

452
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,850
even become more amiable.

453
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,640
But when it was a blind date for you,

454
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,570
you hung up the phone immediately.

455
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,500
I'm different.

456
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,580
I have Onmyoji Arena.

457
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,200
Oitsuki is my girlfriend.

458
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,810
Girlfriend, huh?

459
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,380
You can't even use Oitsuki's combo properly.

460
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,130
Scumbag.

461
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,230
If you have time to bicker,

462
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,970
you might as well take more notes.

463
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,610
The upcoming matches won't be easy.

464
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,660
Team Arashi is a traditional powerhouse.

465
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,120
They haven't been doing great lately,

466
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,490
but they haven't fallen to the point of playing relegation matches.

467
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,830
They've been hovering in the middle to upper ranks of the league.

468
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,590
FNATIC is even trickier.

469
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,290
Theoretically speaking,

470
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,250
they're the only

471
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,010
challenging team in our group.

472
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,130
Don't underestimate them.

473
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,590
You know this well, right?

474
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,570
I remember

475
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,070
in the last practice match,

476
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,180
Cat was suffering in their clutches.

477
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,060
In the end, it was thanks to Smiling in the mid lane that we held our ground.

478
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,560
The bottom lane duo's strong advantage dragged the game to mid-to-late stages,

479
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,800
and we were only able to win

480
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,000
when Cheng took over.

481
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,820
So we still need to do our homework properly.

482
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,280
Did you hear that?

483
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,540
Do your homework well.

484
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,300
Mom.

485
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,420
Can you please not introduce people to me

486
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,010
without my consent again?

487
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,130
I really don't have the time.

488
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,140
As for FNATIC,

489
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,860
I doubt they need any introduction.

490
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,060
We've already faced them multiple times.

491
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,920
I believe everyone has a good grasp of their skills.

492
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,970
-Nice.
-Come on.

493
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,040
If they're assigned to the red side,

494
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,120
Kun will most likely get Daruma in the bottom lane.

495
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,420
If Daruma's field of vision

496
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,980
includes the enemy jungler,

497
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,650
he'll start looking for counter-ganks

498
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,000
or invade the jungle.

499
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,070
This has a high success rate.

500
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,630
Look,

501
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,460
here,

502
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,030
here,

503
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:38,930
and here—

504
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,410
he's ambushed them all.

505
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,210
On the contrary,

506
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,800
if we don't let him get Daruma from the start

507
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
and take control of the river vision on their side,

508
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,250
his rhythm won't be nearly as good.

509
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,760
Look.

510
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,140
In that match against Team CK,

511
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,560
he lost his rhythm in the early stage,

512
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,720
so God Yang almost fully counter-jungled him later on.

513
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,040
That's true.

514
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:55,880
God Ming.

515
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,930
These mixed nuts are pretty good.

516
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,410
One great idea after another.

517
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,870
Come on, have one more bag.

518
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,860
Why do I feel like our team suddenly

519
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,450
has another data analyst out of nowhere?

520
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
I think it's nice.

521
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,750
We don't have to pay extra anyway.

522
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,910
If you all were like Tong Yao,

523
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,070
I'd be over the moon.

524
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,270
Laziness can be cultivated gradually, you know.

525
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,740
No rush.

526
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,340
Screw you.

527
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,290
Yummy and satisfying.

528
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:22,970
Look.

529
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,340
When Lu Yue first joined,

530
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,460
he was also very diligent.

531
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,250
But isn't he just

532
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,300
a loser who takes other people's accounts

533
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,820
and make them lose points now?

534
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,580
Shut up, you fatty.

535
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:35,910
Okay.

536
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,780
Got it.

537
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,910
Let's meet there later.

538
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,140
Lu Yue, where are my car keys?

539
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,390
I don't know.

540
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,480
Tong Yao.

541
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,480
Pay attention to this as well.

542
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,740
Going out?

543
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:03,820
Yeah.

544
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,500
My mom set up a meeting with that woman.

545
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,480
She only told me after she left the house.

546
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Which woman?

547
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,900
A blind date?

548
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,630
What blind date?

549
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,750
You're running around barefoot again.

550
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,950
Next time you have your period,

551
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,880
even if you're crawling around, no one will pity you.

552
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,390
Put them on.

553
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,010
Tong Yao.

554
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,190
Come take a look at this habit of Kun's.

555
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,720
Coming, coming.

556
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,440
And pay extra attention to this point.

557
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,420
Miss Su.

558
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,030
Hello, I'm Su Luo.

559
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,490
I'm Lu Sicheng.

560
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,440
Someone asked me to take you home.

561
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,770
How about a cup of coffee?

562
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,699
No, thank you. I have things to attend to.

563
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,460
Okay.

564
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,730
Please wait here for me.

565
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,350
I'm going to the restroom.

566
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:16,909
Sure.

567
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,030
Hello, darling.

568
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,969
How was it?

569
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,409
Did the blind date go well?

570
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,170
Mom.

571
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,040
I must say, these matchmakers you found

572
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
aren't very thorough in their work.

573
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,350
You aren't satisfied?

574
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,400
Didn't we look at the photos before?

575
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,199
It's not that.

576
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,530
In person,

577
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,429
he's even more handsome.

578
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,340
But because I didn't expect it,

579
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,600
I didn't prepare much.

580
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,800
My daughter is naturally beautiful.

581
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,770
What else does she need to prepare?

582
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,570
Anyway, this guy...

583
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,970
I'm very satisfied.

584
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,090
Okay, he's waiting for me outside.

585
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,020
I've got to go.

586
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,530
Let's talk when I get home. Bye.

587
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,250
Okay.

588
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
On the blind date?

589
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,990
We just met.

590
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,210
Is she pretty?

591
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,340
I didn't get a good look.

592
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,000
Where are you?

593
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,050
At the first-floor cafe in Starlight Building.

594
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,070
Went so far for a blind date?

595
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,640
But I know that place.

596
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,190
Turn right when you exit,

597
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,230
and there's this phenomenal takoyaki place in about 300 meters.

598
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,250
Get a portion with extra nori and bonito flakes.

599
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,380
It'll help you win any goddess' heart.

600
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,870
Is food all you know about?

601
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,080
Ungrateful.

602
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,910
Sorry to keep you waiting.

603
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,860
Fifteen minutes. Stomach issues?

604
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,330
You men really don't know anything.

605
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,720
I went to touch up my makeup,

606
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,990
not to relieve myself.

607
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,210
Waiter.

608
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:31,930
Hello.

609
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,910
Check, please.

610
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,520
Here, please.

611
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,060
Here.

612
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,210
Let's go.

613
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,650
I heard you're a professional esports player.

614
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,170
Yes.

615
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,950
You're different from what I imagined.

616
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,320
I thought esports players were all internet-addicted teenagers.

617
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,680
I didn't expect someone like you.

618
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,480
What about me?

619
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,770
Well, I think this is going well so far.

620
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,770
What do you think?

621
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,130
Esports is indeed great.

622
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,590
Is this... your first blind date?

623
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,450
It's not yours?

624
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,930
Where are we going now?

625
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,730
Do you want to have that?

626
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,880
I'm not used to eating these.

627
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,080
It looks very greasy.

628
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,760
And it doesn't seem... very hygienic.

629
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,600
Hello, I'd like a large one.

630
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,760
Extra bonito flakes and nori, to go.

631
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,750
Okay, coming right up.

632
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,630
He's so handsome.

633
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,030
How can he be so handsome?

634
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,320
You like this kind of food?

635
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,630
I'm taking it home for my pet.

636
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,590
You have a pet?

637
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
Is it a dog?

638
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,100
Your pet eats well.

639
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,340
It's a rabbit.

640
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,480
A rabbit?

641
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,550
Can rabbits eat such greasy stuff?

642
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,260
She's a garbage disposal. She eats everything.

643
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,230
Thank you.

644
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,450
How can you say that about your rabbit?

645
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,790
This rain came out of nowhere.

646
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,320
It wasn't mentioned in the weather forecast.

647
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,250
Wait here for me.

648
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,310
I'll go get my car.

649
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,050
She's so lucky.

650
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,720
So handsome.

651
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,990
I wish I had a car like that on rainy days too.

652
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm different.

653
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,020
I want the man inside that car.

654
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,340
Dream on.

655
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,250
Look at his girlfriend and then look at yourself.

656
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,610
We're really unlucky.

657
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,520
Why is it raining so heavily?

658
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,780
We couldn't even sit down and have a proper chat.

659
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,380
Are you free this weekend? We could...

660
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,910
I have a match this weekend.

661
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,280
Then I'll go watch your match.

662
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,800
I've never watched

663
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,230
an esports match before.

664
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,390
If I were your friend,

665
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,140
could I go backstage—

666
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,740
Miss Su.

667
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,830
You're quite nice.

668
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,260
You're quite nice too.

669
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,180
It's just that I think

670
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,400
we might not be a good match.

671
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,750
Look at this sudden heavy rain.

672
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,160
It's like a sign from heaven.

673
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,020
How about this?

674
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,220
Tell me where you live,

675
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,480
and I'll send you home.

676
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,100
Okay.

677
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:34,810
Tong Yao.

678
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,140
Haven't you watched this video thrice already?

679
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,930
I'm just looking at the details again.

680
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,480
It's raining so heavily.

681
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,410
I wonder if Cheng brought an umbrella.

682
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,720
My brother hasn't come back yet,

683
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,130
so it means his blind date is going well.

684
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,990
We'll have a sister-in-law soon.

685
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,310
Where are you going?

686
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,540
Do you want to play duo?

687
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,600
I'm tired. I need to lie down for a bit.

688
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,330
What's wrong with her?

689
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,440
What do you think?
