According to the data,

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,860
the number of esports users in China is expected to exceed 200 million,

However,

42
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,929
as esports professionalization becomes a trend,

the shortage of esports talents

44
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,780
is becoming a new bottleneck for the development of the esports industry.

45

I told you to bring an umbrella when you went out, but you didn't.

173
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,450
Now I have to pick you up.

174
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,230
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

175
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,829
These dolls are all for you.

176
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,970
He said he's sorry for keeping you waiting,

177
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,700
and these dolls are all for you.

178
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,560
What are you looking at?

179
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,740
Nothing.

180
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,130
Here.

181
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,160
This is for you.

182
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,410
Take it.

183
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,860
Well, let's go. It's freezing.

184
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,550
Take it.

185
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,250
Let's go.

186
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,470
Go home and take a hot shower to get rid of the chill.

187
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,140
We have the National League draw tomorrow.

188
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,180
Don't catch a cold.

189
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,360
Oh right, there's the draw ceremony tomorrow.

190
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,060
I almost forgot.

191
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,470
What's on your mind?

192
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,800
None of your business.

193
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,130
I hope in tomorrow's draw,

194
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,590
we don't end up in the same group as you.

195
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,260
Even though we're in the relegation zone for the spring season,

196
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
we still want to dream a little

197
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,190
about the national championship.

198
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,980
But even if it's not us,

199
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,500
it'll be Team CK, right?

200
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,590
But CK isn't as unbeatable as you.

201
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,330
We recently won a practice match against them.

202
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,490
CK, rookies.

203
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,390
Can win.

204
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,410
You beat CK?

205
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,570
That's impressive.

206
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,860
Did you hear that, Shorty?

207
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,310
They say we're unbeatable.

208
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,110
See how good they are with words.

209
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,440
Look, you sneezed.

210
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,460
Getting cocky.

211
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,500
See you on the field.

212
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,360
See you on the field.

213
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,570
Your streaming hours this month

214
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,860
are still far from enough.

215
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,370
Still eating?

216
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,900
Let me finish eating first.

217
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,830
How can I have energy to stream without eating?

218
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,560
You're back.

219
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,140
Didn't you two take umbrellas?

220
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,300
How did you still get wet?

221
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,850
Four people with two umbrellas.

222
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,850
The rain is so heavy. What's the use?

223
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,530
You caught a cold?

224
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,580
I don't know.

225
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,890
Take some medicine.

226
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,030
The draw ceremony is tomorrow.

227
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,460
You're going with a runny nose?

228
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,170
It's just a chill. Why take medicine?

229
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,370
I'm going upstairs to take a hot shower.

230
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,820
What's this?

231
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,780
It's Cheng's jacket.

232
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,810
I mean this.

233
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,780
It's a rabbit.

234
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,820
Where did the rabbit come from?

235
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,770
I should thank Cheng for this.

236
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,000
In the children's play area,

237
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
he and the other ADC,

238
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,390
two men with a combined height of nearly four meters,

239
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,350
battled it out at the claw machine,

240
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,810
as if they were determined

241
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,920
to clean out all the dolls in the mall.

242
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,770
That's where the rabbit came from.

243
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,010
Professional players have nimble fingers.

244
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,560
They're really good at grabbing these things.

245
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,360
I've been with Cheng for so long,

246
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,230
but he's never given me a rabbit.

247
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,960
Give it to me.

248
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,860
No way.

249
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,820
Give it to me.

250
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,500
No.

251
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,140
Give it to me!

252
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,140
[Onmyoji Arena]

253
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,390
Cat,

254
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,540
do you think Cheng will draw Group A or Group B?

255
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
What do you think?

256
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,460
I heard that today's host

257
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,220
includes a young lady

258
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
who seems to be Ai Jia's girlfriend.

259
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,920
Is that so?

260
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,840
I hope she brings us good luck.

261
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,370
Today's host is my honey.

262
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,410
I know.

263
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,270
Watch yourself and behave.

264
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,330
Don't get too carried away.

265
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,530
Mind your own business.

266
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,660
Later on this big screen,

267
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,520
the names of each team in the draw will be displayed.

268
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,170
What are you doing?

269
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:43,970
Watch it.

270
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,380
Dear audience,

271
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,970
hello everyone.

272
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,890
I'm Xiaosen, the host of today's draw ceremony.

273
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,770
Hello everyone, I'm Jinyang.

274
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,040
The highly anticipated National League draw ceremony

275
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,530
is about to begin.

276
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,900
Liang Sheng, let me go on stage later.

277
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,050
I want to take a photo with my honey.

278
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,460
-Please see the rules of this season's draw ceremony
-It's up to you.

279
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,370
on the screen.

280
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,670
We can see that

281
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,880
according to the 2020 Onmyoji Arena

282
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,140
spring season rankings,

283
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,020
we can divide them into four seed pools.

284
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,460
The first and second place will be in the No. 1 seed pool.

285
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,420
The third to sixth place will be in the No. 2 seed pool.

286
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,160
The seventh to tenth place

287
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,290
will be in the No. 3 seed pool.

288
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,970
-We are in that seed pool.
-The 11th and 12th place

289
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,030
-will be in the No. 4 seed pool.
-Okay.

290
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,810
The order of the draw

291
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,770
will proceed in the order of Group A-B-A-B.

292
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,080
First, let's welcome

293
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,500
the two teams from the No. 1 seed pool to come on stage for the draw.

294
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,050
Since Team CK is the champion of the spring season,

295
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,370
the first team to draw will be Team CK.

296
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,540
Now, let's welcome the captain of Team CK,

297
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,670
God Yang, to come on stage for the draw.

298
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,320
Group B.

299
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,810
Next, let's welcome the captain of ZGDX,

300
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,570
Chessman, to come on stage for the draw.

301
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,860
Although the result is already clear,

302
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,490
please come up and draw, Cheng,

303
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,220
just to go through the process.

304
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,130
Cheng, handsome!

305
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,130
Bravo!

306
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,020
Group A.

307
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,690
Alright, thank you. Please take your seats.

308
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,050
Now, for the next part,

309
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,420
let's welcome

310
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,820
the Team Red Arrow from the No. 2 seed pool to come on stage for the draw.

311
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,700
Please.

312
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,940
Why does Cheng's expression look so scary?

313
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,890
What happened?

314
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,650
He looks murderous.

315
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,320
Yeah.

316
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,000
Cheng, why are you looking so grim?

317
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,350
Holding in coughs and sneezes.

318
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,710
It's so uncomfortable.

319
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,160
So that's why you look murderous,

320
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,590
with a face as dark as the bottom of a pot.

321
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,860
Just to avoid sneezing and coughing?

322
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,950
Since when did you care so much about your image?

323
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,040
Cheng,

324
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,510
are you sure you don't need to take cold medicine?

325
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,310
Yes.

326
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,850
But the competition is in two days.

327
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,190
How are you going to command with your voice so hoarse?

328
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,190
I'll be fine the day after tomorrow.

329
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,150
Shorty,

330
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,330
what's going on between you and Jian Yang from Team CK?

331
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,220
Aren't you done with him?

332
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,150
What was that look he just gave you?

333
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,860
What are you talking about?

334
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,950
I'm done with him.

335
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,940
Completely.

336
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,200
Besides, we're not even in the same zone.

337
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,500
If we were to meet, it would have to be in the finals, right?

338
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,080
The opening match of the National League,

339
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,540
we're playing against CK.

340
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,310
Next, let's welcome

341
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,690
today's last team,

342
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,170
the dark horse that fought its way out of the relegation zone this year,

343
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,530
-Team YQCB.
-It's our turn.

344
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,390
Please come on stage for the draw.

345
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,120
-Team YQCB, please.
-Come on!

346
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,960
Go! Go for it!

347
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,390
Quickly.

348
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,370
Stand up.

349
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,150
Honey, give me a hug.

350
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,400
What are you doing?

351
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,510
Alright, come on, let's take a look together.

352
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,280
Congratulations, it's Group B.

353
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,170
Alright, thank you. Please take your seat.

354
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,010
Ai Jia!

355
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,200
Nice, nice.

356
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,570
Cool.

357
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
-Have a look.
-Okay.

358
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,290
Now, all the 12 teams

359
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,660
-So ugly.
-have drawn lots.

360
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,130
So, for our groups A and B,

361
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,060
what about the group members?

362
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,550
Please look at the screen.

363
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,840
First, Group A:

364
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,930
ZGDX, FNATIC, Red Arrow,

365
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,570
KING, Arashi, and Obsidian.

366
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,620
Next is Group B:

367
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,500
CK, YQCB, Doomsday Orcs,

368
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,910
Alpha, DQ.Five, and ANT.

369
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,410
Based on Lu Yue and Tong Yao's current

370
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,340
individual data and performance,

371
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,680
as well as their shikigami pool and lineup compatibility,

372
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,200
Tong Yao is more suitable as the starter for the National League.

373
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,440
The club has made the final decision:

374
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,190
Tong Yao will be the starter for the National League,

375
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,910
while Lu Yue will rotate with Tong Yao as a substitute.

376
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,090
I've already notified the official blog manager.

377
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,890
The official Weibo account will announce it soon.

378
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,680
What are you looking at?

379
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,900
You better play well in the matches.

380
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,830
Otherwise, you might end up back by the water cooler.

381
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,010
Tong Yao is going to fight alongside us now!

382
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,090
Go, Tong Yao!

383
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,180
Good luck.

384
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:51,980
Tong Yao,

385
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,660
whether we'll be eating meat in Shanghai this October

386
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,150
or drinking soup in front of the computers

387
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,750
depends on you now. Go for it.

388
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,250
The opening match is the day after tomorrow.

389
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,110
As the starter, Tong Yao, you've got to do your best.

390
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,080
Tong Yao, welcome to ZGDX.

391
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,370
K,

392
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,350
haven't I already joined a long time ago?

393
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Then I'll shut up.

394
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,780
Good luck.

395
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:31,850
Lu Yue.

396
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,390
I'm fine.

397
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,970
The data is objective, after all.

398
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,670
My overall strength compared to that Shorty

399
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,560
is still a bit lacking.

400
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,550
I'll work hard from now on.

401
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,350
I'm confident I can surpass her.

402
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,900
Keep a good attitude.

403
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,780
Keep it up.

404
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,920
I will.

405
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,010
Let's go.

406
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,530
The FNATIC assigned to our division,

407
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,290
we've already played against them this year.

408
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,320
Their top laner can occasionally suppress Cat,

409
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,900
pressuring him to the point where he can't function.

410
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,960
Quite impressive.

411
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,060
Team KING is the newly promoted team from the spring season.

412
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,010
I heard their comeback rate in unfavorable situations

413
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,400
is as high as 80 percent.

414
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,590
There's also Obsidian,

415
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,430
who, like our neighbor, played in the relegation matches this year.

416
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,550
But now even our neighbor can beat CK.

417
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,130
So anything is possible.

418
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,220
Forget about it.

419
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,180
To be honest,

420
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,570
it feels like watching my honey getting married.

421
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,670
The one above is wrong.

422
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,250
It's clearly the feeling of marrying off a daughter.

423
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,230
Hoping our sweetie will shine in her new team,

424
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,060
and fiercely slap the faces of those

425
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,830
guys who think esports only belongs to men.

426
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,130
At the same time, there's a feeling of

427
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,100
"My sweetie is so great.

428
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,160
Why should I give her to you?" It's a bit disheartening.

429
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,860
Honey,

430
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,450
your husband is waiting for you at the venue.

431
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,390
If you win the match,

432
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,850
how about I propose to you?

433
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,490
The host lady is both beautiful and sharp-tongued.

434
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,250
Love her.

435
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,390
Sis, you're trending.

436
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,470
Please call me Queen.

437
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,580
At this moment, fear nothing. Just go for it.

438
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,970
Miss, I've been following you for a long time.

439
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,630
You're so positive and inspiring.

440
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,390
No matter what happens, keep going.

441
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,590
Become your own queen.

442
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,040
That's the spirit we need.

443
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,770
Believe in yourself, and you'll be unstoppable.

444
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,890
Hello.

445
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,000
Dear Onmyoji Arena masters,

446
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,580
and all our audience

447
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,650
who are watching the livestream,

448
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,570
greetings to you all.

449
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,440
Welcome to

450
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,690
-It's started.
-the 2020 Onmyoji Arena

451
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,640
Professional League

452
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,500
-Chinese Division's...
-It's quite a grand scene.

453
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,890
opening match.

454
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,620
Let's record every

455
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,900
ordinary but unforgettable moment.

456
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,120
Hello everyone, I'm your host Xiaosen.

457
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,300
Alright, thank you.

458
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,440
Now, our two opening match teams

459
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,170
are all ready.

460
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,370
So next,

461
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,860
let's welcome them to the stage

462
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,300
with all your enthusiasm.

463
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,159
First, let's welcome CK!

464
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,120
Luck,

465
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,820
the top laner of OPL,

466
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,780
specializes in tanky shikigami,

467
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,520
with Butterfly as his ADC.

468
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:45,409
Luck specializes in tanky shikigami.

469
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,110
known as the nightmare of top laners.

470
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,340
Butterfly has an aggressive playstyle,

471
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,690
who is always ready to fight

472
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,460
and ranked among the top ADCs in China.

473
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,650
Their mid laner is Floret.

474
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,750
His signature shikigami is also Tamamonomae.

475
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,910
Miss, what are you mumbling about?

476
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,330
What do you know?

477
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,260
This is called knowing your enemy to win every battle.

478
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,860
Jian Yang from Team CK...

479
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,050
It's Jian Yang. You even have studied your ex-boyfriend?

480
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,510
That's because she doesn't want to lose face in front of her ex.

481
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,750
Miss, what's wrong?

482
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,230
To be honest,

483
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,880
my stomach hurts a bit.

484
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,050
You're not gonna...

485
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,290
Now, next,

486
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,340
let's welcome

487
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,740
their long-time rival,

488
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,330
ZGDX.

489
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,940
Go for it. Don't be afraid.

490
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,330
They're on stage.

491
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,240
Here they come.

492
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,090
So handsome.

493
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,260
Our girl still looks a bit nervous.

494
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,740
Not very confident.

495
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,420
It's her first time on stage.

496
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,280
That's normal.

497
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,320
She's far from how I was back in the day.

498
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,440
Who can compete with you?

499
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,260
Today is Tong Yao's

500
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,790
first game as the starting mid laner.

501
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,190
She must be very nervous.

502
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,240
I hope she can make some big news.

503
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,220
We have the tanky Top Laner Cat.

504
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,610
Look at his muscular build.

505
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,340
He's really tough to deal with.

506
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,310
The cool-headed Jungler K,

507
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,420
an scary assassin with a boyish face.

508
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,170
Next, we have a rose among thorns,

509
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,080
the first female esports player in China.

510
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,160
The highly anticipated starting Mid Laner, Smiling.

511
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,390
We finally get to see her true face.

512
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,720
A cute short-haired girl, very adorable.

513
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,700
And the golden Support, Pang.

514
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,100
His chubby appearance

515
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,760
makes people feel at ease.

516
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,840
Alright, and finally,

517
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,100
we have our ADC god, Chessman.

518
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,940
Let's welcome them with the greatest

519
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,850
enthusiasm!

520
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,810
Okay, now our two teams

521
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,450
are all ready.

522
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,740
Without further ado,

523
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,270
both teams, please return to your positions.

524
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,490
Get ready to present our guests here

525
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,960
with a wonderful battle.

526
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,220
CK!

527
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,890
Go CK!

528
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,260
Go! Go! Go!

529
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,770
Hello everyone, I'm your host Chen Jinyang.

530
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,030
I'm especially honored today

531
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,910
to have Xiaofan and Chen Yao

532
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,930
join me in commentating

533
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,910
the first match of the National League.

534
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,540
Hello everyone, I'm Xiaofan, one of the commentators for this match.

535
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,110
Hello everyone, I'm Chen Yao, the other commentator.

536
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,800
Today,

537
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,610
Miss Jinyang is dressed in a very Japanese style.

538
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,980
Is it imitating the Yoto Hime shikigami?

539
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,950
Do you

540
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,720
particularly enjoy this kind of cosplay usually?

541
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,390
No.

542
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,380
Miss.

543
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,000
What's up, buddy?

544
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,040
Why so nervous?

545
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,030
To be honest,

546
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,660
I'm so nervous I feel like throwing up my lunch.

547
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,650
The match hasn't even started yet. You'd better not scare people away.

548
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,230
You are indeed very nervous.

549
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,100
We didn't even have time for lunch today.

550
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,720
Why don't you pretend to throw up?

551
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,850
That's more like it.

552
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,130
Let's make this quick.

553
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,980
As expected, the most experienced one.

554
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,010
Are you two also looking forward to today's match?

555
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,470
Yes, yes, yes.

556
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,190
I think it's not just the two of us.

557
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,300
-Yeah.
-The fans

558
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,050
and the vast number of online viewers are all very excited

559
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:54,850
about this opening match

560
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,770
between CK and ZGDX.

561
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,890
I believe everyone still remembers

562
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,600
the recent Spring Contest,

563
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,540
where the scene was truly,

564
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,750
well, truly...

565
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,130
A bloodshed.

566
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,170
Right.

567
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,420
Yes, exactly, a bloodshed.

568
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,490
It seems Miss Jinyang

569
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,890
summarized it very accurately.

570
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,450
-Yeah.
-After all, these two teams

571
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,820
have a lot to expect

572
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,200
in the National League.

573
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,320
In today's first match,

574
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,390
let's see

575
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,750
if Team ZGDX

576
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,360
can achieve their revenge for the Spring Contest finals,

577
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,780
or if Team CK can

578
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,930
continue their miraculous winning streak.

579
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,650
Moreover,

580
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,020
there's another very exciting point,

581
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,700
which is the new damage dealer who just joined Team ZGDX this year.

582
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,050
She's a girl, you know.

583
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,370
Have you ever seen a girl play professionally?

584
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,480
No, I really haven't seen that before.

585
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,180
Don't mention me, don't mention me.

586
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,580
I feel like so many people are looking at me.

587
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,090
Isn't it better to focus on the big screen?

588
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,190
What are you looking at?

589
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,050
However, from what we can see at the venue today,

590
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:43,860
I feel like

591
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,850
Miss Smiling seems a bit nervous.

592
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,140
-Yes.
-Do you think it's because

593
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,200
she's the only female player

594
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,420
participating in such a large-scale competition?

595
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,620
That's possible.

596
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,580
Everyone gets nervous the first time they compete on stage.

597
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,180
It doesn't seem to have anything to do

598
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,330
with whether she's a girl or not, right?

599
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,130
Right.

600
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,210
-Nice, sister.
-That makes sense.

601
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,490
Alright, the match has now entered the ban and pick phase.

602
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,420
Let's see who they're going to ban.

603
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,770
The battle is about to begin.

604
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,920
Go for it, Smiling.

605
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,630
As expected, CK's first ban is

606
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,970
Smiling's signature, Tamamonomae.

607
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,260
It seems they've done their homework.

608
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,640
After all, this is no ordinary Tamamonomae.

609
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,750
This is the No. 1 Tamamonomae player in China.

610
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,480
-Yeah.
-Come on.

611
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,560
Let's ban Luck's Tanuki first.

612
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,140
Alright, goodbye Tanuki.

613
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,850
ZGDX has banned

614
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,530
Luck's signature, Tanuki.

615
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,690
It seems both sides

616
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,740
have put effort into their bans.

617
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,820
Yes, indeed.

618
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,230
Enenra.

619
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,260
Aobozu.

620
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,230
My goodness.

621
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,930
Both sides got excited and banned

622
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,770
Enenra, Tamamonomae,

623
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,830
Kiyohime and Shiro, four mid laners.

624
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,300
Six bans,

625
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,560
four used to restrict the opponent's mid laner.

626
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,260
Looks like the mid lane will be interesting this time.

627
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,700
Meanwhile, it will test

628
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,130
which side has a deeper shikigami pool.

629
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,080
What the hell?

630
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,670
If the shikigami pool is shallow,

631
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,280
I wouldn't dare to play.

632
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,650
I'll pass your words

633
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,290
to the one guarding the water dispenser behind.

634
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,890
Come on, let's pick Susabi and Yoto Hime first.

635
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,770
Get me Youko.

636
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,310
Cheng, considering the opponent's lineup,

637
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,930
Youko might be weak in the late game.

638
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,810
You should pick Hakuro.

639
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,670
We're not playing for late game.

640
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,220
I said we'll end this quickly.

641
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,490
There's no late game in this match.

642
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,420
Domineering Captain Lu, may you have great fortune.

643
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,840
What? Chessman chose Youko.

644
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,610
Let me tell you,

645
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,010
this is very risky.

646
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,930
He chose this lineup.

647
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,630
If he doesn't gain an advantage in the early game,

648
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,850
it will be hard in the late game.

649
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,530
I see.

650
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,870
He wants to end the game quickly

651
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,590
and give CK a shock.

652
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,530
This move is too risky.

653
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,370
Alright, now we can see

654
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,290
both teams have chosen their lineups.

655
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,460
Let's look at CK's first. They've chosen

656
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,880
Hannya paired with Yasha in the top lane, Susabi in mid lane,

657
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,230
and Chin with Ichimokuren in the bottom lane.

658
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,140
This lineup

659
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,920
is aimed at farming safely for the late game.

660
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,410
On the other hand, Team ZGDX...

661
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,190
Look, the opponent's lineup is all for late game,

662
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,910
while ours is all for early game.

663
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,020
I want to say you guys are too cocky.

664
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:08,880
I have a headache.

665
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,420
Let's finish this quickly and go back to sleep.

666
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,070
I second that.

667
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,330
What's wrong with you?

668
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,540
My stomach hurts.

669
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,740
I want to um.

670
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,870
What um?

671
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,280
You know, answering nature's call.

672
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,710
That kind of strong call.

673
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,080
I need to take a dump.

674
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,760
I think you want to make it into the in-game quotes.

675
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,960
In-game quotes?

676
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,100
What's that?

677
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,750
Hey, guys backstage, you hear that?

678
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,320
Update it in real-time!

679
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,780
Look at our Miss mid laner,

680
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,880
in less than 30 seconds into the game...

681
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,890
Please don't.

682
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,650
Dear backstage staff,

683
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,100
please do me a favor.

684
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,530
Can you cut this part out?

685
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,400
I'm begging you on my knees.

686
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,380
Stop talking.

687
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,270
Be careful not to shit your pants.

688
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,530
One's sick, and the other wants to take a dump.

689
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,250
Teammates,

690
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,680
can we still play a decent opening match?

691
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,710
I'm not playing.

692
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,900
Go get Lu Yue.

693
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,710
I want to go home.

694
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,540
It's too late.

695
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,090
Alright, it's online.
