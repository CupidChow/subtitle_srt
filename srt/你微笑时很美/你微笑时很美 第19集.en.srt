Cheng.

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,990
One last question.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,070
Go ahead.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,630
These past few days, you’ve been ignoring me.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,430
Is it just because you're angry?

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,640
Or is there another reason?

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,790
It's because I'm afraid.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,740
Afraid I'll soften.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Everyone

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,210
will inevitably have to make sacrifices

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,330
for what they love.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,180
Be prepared.

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,330
This is just the beginning.

[Episode 19]

16
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,430
Team Obsidian team is near Octopus.

17
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,030
They've discovered that ZGDX is alreaedy attacking Octopus.

18
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,060
Steady now, Cat.

19
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,100
Clear the lane. Clear the top lane.

20
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,789
ZGDX!

21
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,850
Take the top tower.

22
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,910
Go, go, go! Let's fight!

23
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,650
We've got control.

24
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,610
Hold steady. Keep them occupied.

25
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,070
ZGDX has secured Octopus.

26
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,470
They're going for a follow-up attack!

27
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,520
Nice!

28
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,050
The team fight isn't over yet.

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,940
Alright, ZGDX

30
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,700
wins this team fight.

31
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,150
Lu Yue, go in.

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,160
Here they come.

33
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,329
Obsidian is unstoppable now.

34
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,990
ZGDX continues to pursue

35
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,510
and secures another kill.

36
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,170
Beautiful!

37
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,590
This is the last team fight.

38
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,590
-Coming.
-Got it.

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,030
Quick! Go, go, go!

Be careful!

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,790
There's another one behind. Hurry!

43

Chase them!

44
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,590
Spread out.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,410
Give me space to deal damage.

46
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,610
Chase, chase, chase!

47
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,560
Chessman continues to pursue.

48
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,030
Beautiful! He's taken down another one.

49
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,790
Chessman takes a double kill

50
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,980
and keeps going.

51
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,470
The three divine items.

00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,570
Beautiful! Chessman secures a triple kill.

53
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,710
There's a great chance to end this game.

54
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,150
Beautiful!

55
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,110
Congratulations to ZGDX

56
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,080
for winning this match.

57
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,060
Congratulations to ZGDX.

58
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,380
Thanks to Nongfu Spring

59
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,820
for their strong support this season.

60
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,850
Back to the match.

61
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,579
ZGDX's performance in this match was

62
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,490
truly unexpected.

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,540
Especially player Lv.

64
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,010
His performance this game was excellent.

65
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,010
He won the MVP award.

66
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,380
To be honest,

67
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,880
if a substitute can play this well,

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
I think the other teams

69
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,470
might need to reassess

70
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,930
ZGDX's overall strength.

71
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,870
That's right.

72
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,980
What's Lu Yue treating us to tonight?

73
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,810
Let me tell you, Lu Yue,

74
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,329
you can eat whatever you want tonight.

75
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,210
Sounds good!

76
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,290
Yes!

78
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,060
Lu Yue.

00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,030
You played well.

MVP of the match.

81
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,780
I feel like after this match,

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,450
you're going to gain 300,000 fans.

83
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,570
What are you doing?

84
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,540
What did the water dispenser do to you?

85
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,020
Or are you planning to retire?

86
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,250
Bro, what did you say to Shorty?

87
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,220
Why does he look like

88
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,610
his whole spirit has collapsed?

89
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,780
It's delicious. Let's go eat.

90
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,370
All you think about is food.

91
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,900
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

92
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,300
After this match,

93
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,600
our team still holds an undefeated record.

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,279
Did you see the fans in the audience?

95
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,440
The light sticks they were waving for your victory,

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,010
those are all thanks to the foundation I laid for you before.

97
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,790
Yes, you built an empire,

98
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,940
and then slapped it all away,

99
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,670
losing 120,000 in the process.

100
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,850
I'm complimenting you.

101
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,030
Do you have any conscience?

102
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,290
You're so ungrateful.

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,150
You played really well.

104
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,010
Very good.

105
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,960
Right?

106
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,710
Why are you two talking so much?

107
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,250
What time will they come out?

108
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,010
Who knows?

109
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,710
-Just wait.
-We’ve been waiting for a long time.

110
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,690
They're coming, they're coming!

111
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,650
Come on, they're here, hurry up!

112
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:04,890
Hello.

113
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,500
Thank you, thank you.

114
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,060
Excuse me, make way please.

115
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,650
I'm sorry, excuse me.

116
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,610
I'm sorry, excuse me.

117
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,580
Look here, look here, look here!

118
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,490
Please look this way.

119
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,740
There's quite a lot of people.

120
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,370
Hello.

121
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,570
Smiling.

122
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,730
Tong Yao, may I ask,

123
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,060
what are your thoughts on the suspension?

124
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,140
I deserve it.

125
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,560
Do you feel wronged?

126
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,730
There are rumors that you did this

127
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,650
to protect your teammate.

128
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,400
I don't feel wronged.

129
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,920
Are you worried about being replaced by Lu Yue?

130
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm only suspended for one game.

131
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,780
Why did you hit someone?

132
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,450
Didn't you know that

133
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,090
it would affect your image?

134
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,900
Or is it because you know that

135
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,460
as the only female player in the league,

136
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,100
your every move will be under public scrutiny,

137
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,810
so you couldn't help but do this

138
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,730
to gain attention?

139
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,650
That's enough.

140
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,430
How do you expect her to answer these questions?

141
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,820
Which media outlet are you from?

142
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,770
That's true.

143
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,830
She was put into the starting lineup without any real training.

144
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,460
I heard she signed a contract before.

145
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,900
Yeah, even if she's really good,

146
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,330
she never turned on her camera during previous livestreams.

147
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,850
How can anyone be sure it was her playing?

148
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,659
The club just gave her a contract right away?

149
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,380
According to Article 246

150
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,740
of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,

151
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,090
anyone who publicly insults others with violence

152
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,930
or false accusations,

153
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,960
causing serious consequences,

154
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,420
may face up to three years of imprisonment,

155
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,610
detention, restrictions on freedom

156
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,890
or deprivation of political rights.

157
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,540
So,

158
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,950
think carefully before you speak.

159
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,190
Hey, don't leave.

160
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,330
Yeah.

161
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,090
Is what Cheng said true?

162
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,530
My brother graduated from the China University of Political Science and Law.

163
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,100
Player Lv.

164
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,330
How does it feel to return to the competitive scene after such a long time?

165
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:32,980
Pretty good.

166
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,650
So I used a newly trained shikigami today.

167
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,290
Yes, player Lv, you brought out

168
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,120
Enenra,

169
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,659
a shikigami that doesn't really fit your usual playstyle.

170
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,010
It was really surprising.

171
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,010
Was this a prepared strategy?

172
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,110
I wouldn't say I prepared in advance.

173
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,510
it's just that our coach,

174
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,710
yes, our coach, God Ming,

175
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:53,240
he said that all Chinese mid laners must know how to play this shikigami.

176
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,710
It would be a bit embarrassing if we didn't.

177
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,310
So I practiced it in advance.

178
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,300
So you're saying Smiling can play Enenra too?

179
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,640
She plays Enenrai very well.

180
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,330
In fact, I think she can play anything.

181
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,910
At first, she wasn't very good with Higanbana,

182
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,710
but later she played it well too.

183
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,010
It seems that the relationship between Team ZGDX's

184
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,140
starting players and substitutes

185
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,170
isn’t as tense as people think.

186
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,580
There's nothing to be tense about.

187
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,570
Our styles are different,

188
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,390
and our playstyles are different too.

189
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,110
Whoever fits the situation better will play.

190
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,750
Right now,

191
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,060
she's still more suitable as a starter than I am.

192
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,820
However, I will become stronger in the future.

193
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,750
That's for sure.

194
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,410
It seems that player Lv is responding to

195
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,680
some doubts online about Team ZGDX.

196
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,950
I trust my teammates' judgment.

197
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,290
If there's something I want,

198
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,820
I'll go for it myself.

199
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,650
At least you have some conscience,

200
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,080
praising me like that.

201
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,680
Don't overthink it.

202
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm just protecting my brother's team,

203
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,640
that's all.

204
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,180
Brother-protecting maniac.

205
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,420
Please, come in.

206
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,900
This place is great.

207
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,040
What's wrong with your leg?

208
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,120
It's chafed.

209
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,140
Be careful.

210
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,240
Wait for me.

211
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,570
Why didn’t you say your foot was chafed?

212
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,330
Are you mute?

213
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,210
I'll just go to the store and buy a band-aid.

214
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,060
Hey,

215
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,150
let's take a photo.

216
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,710
Okay.

217
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,020
Me too, me too!

218
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,280
-Come on. Look at me.
-Let’s drink. Okay.

219
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,250
Look, isn't this filter nice?

220
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,370
Don't move, let's take another one. Let's choose this one.

221
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,230
This brat always has a bunch of women around him every time he goes out.

222
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,340
Sis.

223
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,410
Take a look, how is it?

224
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,560
Look, it's nice, right?

225
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,530
This one's not bad.

226
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,930
How come you're here too?

227
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,010
I came to eat.

228
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,190
I streamed yesterday.

229
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,990
Someone in the chat was talking about you.

230
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,400
I scolded them.

231
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,549
I told them not to talk about you.

232
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,549
You're very good.

233
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,330
Thank you.

234
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,380
But don't do that next time.

235
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,140
They'll scold you too.

236
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,659
You'll be implicated.

237
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,760
Implicated?

238
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,550
I don't understand.

239
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,650
Bro, what does "implicated" mean?

240
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,850
Childish.

241
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,100
Sis, you're so cute.

242
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Even when you're scolding people, you're so cute.

243
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,170
Today I told Tailun that

244
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,670
you're very interesting.

245
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,400
Tailun also said you're very interesting.

246
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,490
Hello.

247
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,480
[Xu Tailun (Dragon), Gaming Position: Jungler]
["Protect the Carry" strategy maniac, free spirit of the jungle]

248
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,810
Come on.

249
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,390
I said no.

250
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,530
That's another guy's girl.

251
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,510
Even if she's not,

252
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm second in line.

253
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
Dream on.

254
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,230
What does "dream on" mean?

255
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,580
It means the same thing.

256
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,520
Bro,

257
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,300
you're not cute at all when you scold.

258
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,060
Sis,

259
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm going to eat first.

260
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,020
I'll contact you on WeChat later.

261
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Walk properly.

262
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,100
That Brother Tailun, he...

263
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,440
What Brother Tailun?

264
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,500
Are you guys close?

265
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,050
He looks familiar.

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,470
Another jungler.

267
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,080
Sis, what's wrong?

268
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,650
That Tailun,

269
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,080
I feel like I've seen him somewhere before.

270
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,120
We've watched

271
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,340
DQ.Five's match videos before, right?

272
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,600
No,

273
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,480
it was somewhere else.

274
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,050
Don't overthink it. Just eat.

275
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,880
Have one.

276
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,470
I remember now!

277
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,520
What is it?

278
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,550
Where I've seen Tailun before.

279
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,960
I saw him in Ning Jiaqi's stream.

280
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,070
What's their relationship?

281
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,000
Are they dating?

282
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,630
You don't know?

283
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,680
Shorty.

284
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,850
Eat meat

285
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,520
to grow taller.

286
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,330
Driver, pull over up ahead.

287
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,860
Cheng, what are you doing?

288
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,790
I'm buying something.

289
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,790
Don't wait for me.

290
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,020
Pancake,

291
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,580
let's go eat.

292
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,040
Let's go, it's time to eat.

293
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,000
Bye bye.

294
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,350
Well...

295
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,420
Sis, come quick!

296
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,940
Well...

297
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,770
What's wrong?

298
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,650
Well...

299
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,390
Why are there only

300
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,070
two of Cheng's goldfish left?

301
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,050
There were three before we left for the match this afternoon.

302
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,180
You’re mistaken, surely?

303
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,580
No way, see for yourself.

304
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,860
Pancake!

305
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,030
[Cheng]

306
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,370
Think of something quick.

307
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,370
Otherwise, when Cheng comes back,

308
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,230
both you and Pancake are done for.

309
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,390
Look,

310
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,840
how about this?

311
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,160
Do you think Cheng is a fool?

312
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,910
Maybe he won't even notice.

313
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
The colors are totally different.

314
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,780
What are you doing?

315
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,370
Cheng, your son ate something he shouldn't have

316
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,220
and overstuffed himself to death.

317
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,420
I was just helping you clean up the mess.

318
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,870
Come to think of it,

319
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,970
I haven't properly thanked you for all your guidance, Cheng.

320
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,350
Your teachings are so profound

321
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,540
that I owe you gratitude as if you gave me a second life.

322
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,150
Cheng is so kind-hearted,

323
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,510
compassionate like a Bodhisattva,

324
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,440
full of love for all living beings.

325
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,240
In line with nature's law of cause and effect,

326
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,780
following the rule of survival of the fittest in the food chain...

327
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,630
Tong Yao.

328
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,830
Speak like a normal person.

329
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,710
My cat

330
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,890
followed the rule of survival of the fittest in the food chain

331
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,240
and ate your fish.

332
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,130
Look on the bright side.

334
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,650
Think about it this way.

335
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,920
Maybe your goldfish son

336
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,520
grew wings and flew away.

337
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,900
In the North Sea there’s a fish named Kun,

338
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,230
so big it can’t fit in a pot.

339
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,520
Band-aid.

340
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,580
Hey, babe.

341
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,180
You're in such a good mood.

342
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,160
Of course.

343
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,070
The weather is beautiful today,

344
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,040
so I'm happy.

345
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,490
Is that so?

346
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,300
Your captain seems pretty gloomy though.

347
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,270
What do you mean?

348
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,540
Your captain

349
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,750
isn't focusing on the game on the stream.

350
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,520
He's searching for live baby piranhas on Taobao.

351
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,540
Ai Jia just forwarded the link to me.

352
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,480
I'm forwarding it to you.

353
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,110
I'm hanging up.

354
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,570
I won't keep you from admiring your captain.

355
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,510
Cheng, you can't buy live baby piranhas.

356
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,630
Try searching for something else.

357
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,410
For some reason,

358
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,040
all the search results are for Venus flytraps.

359
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,430
But hey, having one of those next to the fish tank

360
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,560
might have the same effect.

361
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,470
So I bought it.

362
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,010
Cheng, what effect?

363
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,810
Whoever messes with the fish again will get bitten.

364
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,730
Venus flytrap?

365
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,340
No way.

366
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,760
It won't eat my Pancake, will it?

367
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,650
Pancake, Mommy is sorry.

368
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,510
Pancake.

369
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,660
Pancake.

370
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,270
Pancake?

371
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,490
Pancake?

372
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:04,900
Pancake?

373
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,849
Pancake?

374
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,860
Don't move.

375
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,870
If you move again, get lost.

376
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,720
Lu Sicheng, I'm not...

377
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,670
Let go!

378
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,550
You...

379
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,670
Cheng, why aren't you sleeping yet?

380
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,610
I...

381
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,970
I must be sleepwalking.

382
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,160
Oh my god.

383
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,260
What did I just see?

384
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,610
I'm going blind.

385
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,660
I never thought you were like this, Captain.

386
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,680
It's my fault for being too naive.

387
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,500
Why did I have to see this?

388
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,670
Why did I have to see this again?

389
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,970
I, Pang, out of 365 days a year,

390
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,990
probably only wake up early for no more than five days.

391
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,350
Why did it have to be during these few days,

392
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,260
traumatizing me?

393
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,460
Or do you two actually do this every day?

394
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,220
I'm calling the police.

395
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,700
What's wrong?

396
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,710
Why do you look so shocked?

397
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,290
What are you doing?

398
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,680
Getting so close to someone while they're sleeping?

399
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
I came down from upstairs

400
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,520
to see if my cat is still alive.

401
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,300
Why would a perfectly fine cat suddenly die?

402
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,730
If you're going to make excuses, at least come up with new ones.

403
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,040
It's because you said you were going to buy a Venus flytrap yesterday.

404
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,820
I wanted to check if my cat is still alive.

405
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,730
To see if you strangled it and

406
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,400
were about to flush it down the toilet.

407
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,250
Instead,

408
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,150
I came downstairs and saw you had fallen asleep while playing ranked games.

409
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,660
Out of kindness,

410
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,790
afraid you might get cold,

411
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,390
I covered you with a blanket.

412
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,360
Who knew you'd suddenly

413
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,050
push my head onto your stomach

414
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,250
and mess up my hair?

415
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,720
How is that possible?

416
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,210
You thought I was Pancake.

417
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,650
W-w-what?

418
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,500
Anyway, Pang saw everything.

419
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,240
Hey, Pang, you got it wrong.

420
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,500
We didn't do anything.

421
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,630
If we were going to do something,

422
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,920
why would we be in the living room?

423
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,380
You might not have used your brain, but I did.

424
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,370
If your tone wasn't so harsh,

425
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,510
it might be a bit more convincing.

426
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,040
Now, even I think you're just making excuses.

427
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,460
So what do you think

428
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,040
Pang thinks we're doing?

429
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,130
Cheng,

430
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,530
it's Tuesday today.

431
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,690
There're no practice matches.

432
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,200
We originally said, since everyone's free today,

433
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,660
why don't we go to the Flower, Bird, Fish, Insect Market together?

434
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,350
I could get you a new goldfish.

435
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,560
But since you stayed up all night playing ranked games,

436
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,890
and didn't sleep at all,

437
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,210
forget it.

438
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,110
Okay.

439
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,010
Let me take a shower and change my clothes.

440
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,700
Please wash your hair too.

441
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,870
Let's go.

442
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,130
Okay.

443
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,440
Pang.

444
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,520
Your streaming performance still isn't good enough, right?

445
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,280
It's enough.

446
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,480
What do you mean, enough?

447
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,720
I think you've had enough to eat.

448
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,850
If you keep this up, I'll dock your pay.

449
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,910
What's this?

450
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,650
Sis is looking especially glamorous today.

451
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,520
Excuse me,

452
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,280
do you need to pick the same brand for your shoes?

453
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,370
What's going on?

454
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,300
What do you mean?

455
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,530
Where are our carries up to?

456
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,840
They said they're going to the Flower, Bird, Fish, Insect Market to buy fish.

457
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
They said they're going to the Flower, Bird, Fish, Insect Market to buy fish.

458
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,790
The Flower, Bird, Fish, Insect Market next to the Ministry of Civil Affairs

459
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,840
or the Ministry of Civil Affairs next to the Flower, Bird, Fish, Insect Market?

460
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,970
Spring has arrived.

461
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,320
It's the season where little animals start to get restless.

462
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,800
These two are being too blatant.

463
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,810
Although the club rules don't explicitly forbid it,

464
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,940
but this is still...

465
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,770
I’m so mad right now.

466
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,330
These days, even idiots and elementary school kids

467
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,050
can go on dates without a care in the world

468
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,900
while our Cat,

469
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,780
a normal person, is still single,

470
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,650
and can only work out alone.

471
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,930
Strong.

472
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,910
[Dutch Flower Town]

473
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,250
Cheng.

474
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,770
What?

475
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,450
You look good wearing necklaces.

476
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,690
Why don't you wear any at the base?

477
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,270
Who would I wear it for at the base?

478
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,440
Then who are you wearing it for at the Flower, Bird, Fish, Insect Market?

479
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,030
Fish?

480
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,520
Aren't you wearing a dress too?

481
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,590
Who are you wearing it for?

482
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,170
Cats?

483
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,800
Are you done looking?

484
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,100
Shorty,

485
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,050
are you even an adult?

486
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,600
What?

487
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,600
You can't even walk in high heels,

488
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,060
pretending to be an adult.

489
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Cheng, how many do you want?

490
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,960
Anything's fine.

491
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,490
Then what color do you want?

492
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,330
Black.

493
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,690
The red ones look so nice.

494
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,290
Look, their tails are like little umbrellas.

495
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,280
Is that so?

496
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
I want black ones.

497
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,480
Red is so festive.

498
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,570
Look how lively it is.

499
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
It looks like it'll live a long life.

500
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,890
If that fish of mine

501
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,400
hadn't been eaten by your fat cat,

502
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,250
it would have lived a long life too.

503
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,110
I said I want the black ones.

504
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,000
Mind your own business.

505
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
It's my fish tank, I make the decisions.

506
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,520
If you dislike red so much,

507
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,160
then don't take the Fire Kirin in the future if you're so capable.

508
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,960
Give it to me.

509
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,850
Try touching my Fire Kirin and see what happens.

510
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,040
If you're so capable,

511
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,020
why don't you ask the game designers

512
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,750
to design a Black Kirin for you?

513
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,770
Just say you like it.

514
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,770
No arguments accepted.

515
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,900
It's my jungle, I make the decisions.

516
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,890
I'm just bossy like that.

517
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,890
You talk too much.

518
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,600
Handsome,

519
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,390
if you ask me, just listen to the young lady.

520
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,230
Why argue with your girlfriend over this?

521
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,010
When they get angry,

522
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,710
we men are the ones who suffer.

523
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,690
Next month, when you want to hold her hand,

524
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,600
and she slaps it away

525
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,080
and brings up old scores,

526
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,360
you'll regret it.

527
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,480
Boss,

528
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,570
you're mistaken.

529
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,600
We don't have that kind of relationship.

530
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,260
How much for one of these fish?

531
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,190
One fifty.

532
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,920
Will you sell it for one yuan?

533
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,630
Bro,

534
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,620
you drive an Aston Martin,

535
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,660
and you're haggling with the vendor over fifty cents?

536
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,720
Don’t you have any shame?

537
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,630
My wife is just like your girlfriend,

538
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,390
willful.

539
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,970
We really don't have that kind...

540
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,920
Pay up.

541
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,080
Here's the fish.

542
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,610
Thank you.

543
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,760
Here.

544
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,550
Take care.

545
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,970
What are you looking at?

546
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,620
Let's go.

547
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,180
Coming to this place takes three years off your life every time.

548
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,560
If you want me to die sooner,

549
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,490
just let your cat eat my fish again.

550
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,820
Shorty,

551
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,390
you've been taking advantage of me all day.

552
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,720
That's not right, is it?

553
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,360
So cute.

554
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,680
Boss, how much is it?

555
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,960
This cat is 3,500.

556
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,090
Are you kidding me?

557
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:28,660
One fat cat isn't enough,

558
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
you want another?

559
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,100
What a cute kitten!

560
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,160
Hello.

561
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,770
Brother, buy this for me, please.

562
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,220
I want this kitten.

563
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,230
It can keep me company when you're not around.

564
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,660
I saw it first.

565
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,210
Let's go.

566
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,640
Okay.

567
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,340
Is that Chessman?

568
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,210
Boss, how much is it?

569
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,130
I saw that cat first.

570
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,660
Your fat cat is enough.

571
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,640
You want to keep another one?

572
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,980
We already have two pests at the training base.

573
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,150
I don't want a third one.

574
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,200
Two pests?

575
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,110
You and the cat.

576
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,160
That cat just now was so cute.

577
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,290
It was like Pancake's little brother.

578
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,820
Wait.

579
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,400
Isn't his girlfriend Ning Jiaqi?

580
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,110
Then who was that just now?

581
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,510
Probably a fan of the Team DQ.Five

582
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,730
or a staff member.

583
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,680
What the hell?

584
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,930
He's cheating?

585
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,030
Look at how embarrassed you are.

586
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,960
First Li Huanshuo, now Xu Tailun.

587
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,490
You've never been right about anyone.

588
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,080
Just keep your mouth shut from now on.

589
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,630
You didn't tell me this before.

590
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,200
Would you have believed me if I told you?

591
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
You'd accuse me of making baseless accusations,

592
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,660
of being jealous and hateful.

593
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,850
The car's here.

594
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,140
Please.

595
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,380
I'm a bit hungry. What do you want to eat?

596
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,920
Noodles.

597
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:04,930
Noodles?

598
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,780
Don't girls usually like to eat

599
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,870
Japanese food or something?

600
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,630
Girls?

601
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,920
What's that?

602
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,390
I want noodles.

603
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,240
Steaming hot noodles with soup, meat, and eggs.

604
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,870
If there's a gender that loves noodles in this world,

605
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,800
I would definitely be that gender.

606
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,950
Mr. Li, sorry.

607
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,060
I've changed the destination.

608
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,150
Alright, got it.

609
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,920
Please follow the navigation to the destination.

610
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,120
What do you want to do later?

611
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,360
Head back to the training base for ranked matches.

612
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,670
There're no practice matches today.

613
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,040
I don't want to play today.

614
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,640
Why don't we go watch a movie?

615
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,160
I've already bought the tickets.

616
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,960
Come with me.

617
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,880
Let's go.

618
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,810
Sorry.

619
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,620
What are you doing?

620
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,070
You're acting like a thief.

621
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,370
If we get caught, then...

622
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,260
You've already played a third of the league qualifiers

623
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,980
and you still haven't gotten used to being a public figure

624
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,440
and being constantly exposed to the public?

625
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,710
The first time, I let you hide behind me

626
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,970
because you had just joined the team.

627
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,850
You won't be so lucky the second time.

628
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,610
Why not?

629
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,870
You need to get used to it.

630
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,470
This is the most basic thing.

631
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
First, get used to being a public figure.

632
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,100
Then, learn not to be swayed by public opinion.

633
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,110
Wasn’t your education motto

634
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,470
to cause less trouble and be a good person?

635
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,190
That's what you taught me before.

636
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,510
Even if you manage that,

637
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,850
people will still talk about you.

638
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,750
Someone in the livestream yesterday said you've gained weight.

639
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,390
Really?

640
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,210
See? You're being swayed by public opinion again.

641
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,440
Can't you weigh yourself to see if you've gained weight?

642
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,560
When you can

643
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,040
tell them, 'I haven't gained weight, you're blind,'

644
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,180
that means you've graduated.

645
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,540
Why is being a professional player so exhausting?

646
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,270
If you want the crown, you have to bear its weight.

647
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,430
You brought the kitten inside?

648
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,560
It's quite cold in here.

649
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,700
Baby kittens get sick easily.

650
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,390
If it gets sick,

651
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,530
it'll be troublesome to take care of it.

652
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,810
Just watch the movie.

653
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,970
This Xu Tailun is so scheming.

654
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,970
He left before the movie even ended.

655
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,280
I think there are fans over there.

656
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,150
I'm going to the restroom.

657
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,150
You really haven't improved at all.

658
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,000
Xu Tailun must have known there were fans

659
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,860
and deliberately set you up.

660
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,790
I'll hide first.

661
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,760
I told you this wouldn't happen a second time.

662
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,460
Cheng, are you on a date with Smiling?

663
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,460
Why is she here too?

664
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,920
Or is your whole team here?

665
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,930
Why are you hiding?

666
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,090
Are you shy?

667
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,580
Oh my god, are you two really dating?

668
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,990
At first, I didn’t believe it when people said it online.

669
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,380
I think so too.

670
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,230
Hello everyone.

671
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,670
I'm Smiling, the mid laner for ZGDX.

672
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,110
That's the standard line

673
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,160
used when accepting the MVP interview.

674
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,020
Stop laughing.

675
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,790
She's already shy enough.

676
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,410
It took a lot to convince her to watch a movie with me.

677
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,140
Cheng, is it just the two of you?

678
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:09,950
Yes.

679
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,870
It must be true.

680
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,270
On the Esports Farm Weibo,

681
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,140
I often see people discussing you two.

682
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,660
So are you two really together?

683
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,240
We...

684
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,790
We're just teammates.

685
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:23,130
It's just a coincidence we’re watching a movie together.

686
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,550
Just teammates, huh?

687
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,440
What did you do today?

688
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,480
Bought fish.

689
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,200
Buying fish took you all day?

690
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,740
Do you really think I'm an idiot?

691
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,750
Oh yeah.

692
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,500
We did go to see a movie too.

693
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,310
Your favorite Black Widow.

694
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,500
Let me give you some spoilers.

695
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,170
No.

696
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,310
Come on.

697
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,110
No, no.

698
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,800
Don't spoil my Scarlett Johansson movie for me.

699
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,300
The kitten?

700
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,750
Yes, a fan gave it to me.

701
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
It's really cute.

702
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,590
Thank you.

703
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,620
I'll take good care of it.

704
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,010
Cinema?

705
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,060
Watching a movie?

706
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,620
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

707
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,840
I just brought the kitten back to the training base.

708
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,449
I've been playing ranked games on my alt account all afternoon.

709
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,449
Don't believe me? Ask my teammates.

710
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,800
That's right.

711
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,679
He's been playing games at the base all afternoon.

712
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,320
Besides, cinemas are so cold.

713
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,130
The kitten would definitely catch a cold in the air conditioning.

714
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,860
I wouldn't want that to happen.

715
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,100
Ling Mao,

716
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,130
go turn off the air conditioning here at the base.

717
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,410
The kitten will catch a cold if it's exposed to air conditioning for too long.

718
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,820
It's okay.

719
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,220
I guess it's been in air conditioning for too long.

720
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,080
It's a bit cold.

721
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,040
Isn't that Xu Tailun from Team DQ.Five?

722
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,020
Why are you watching him?

723
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,810
Aren't we playing against them next week?

724
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,210
I'm just scouting our opponent's tactics.

725
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,490
What's wrong?

726
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,190
This Xu Tailun is really annoying.

727
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,220
He's not a good person.

728
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,100
I hate him.

729
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,130
You guys in esports,

730
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,500
none of you are any good.

731
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,080
Are you stupid?

732
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,880
What does this have to do with me?

733
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,610
Team DQ.Five's jungler Xu Tailun

734
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,450
was seen on a date with a woman other than his girlfriend.

735
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,660
When Xu Tailun was streaming,

736
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,850
the clothes he was wearing were completely different from the ones in the photo.

737
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,080
So the person photographed in the morning

738
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,740
definitely wasn't Xu Tailun.

739
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,140
At 2pm at Wantai Cinema,

740
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
I bumped into Smiling and Chessman.

741
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,140
Doesn't this timing perfectly match...

742
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,580
That means that person with Xu Tailun...

743
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,510
To watch that movie...

744
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,810
The time on the electronic clock on the wall also lines up exactly.

745
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,670
I went to buy goldfish with Cheng.

746
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,690
Afterward, since there was still time, we decided to watch a movie.

747
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,860
Nobody said

748
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,960
only couples can go to the movies together.

749
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,660
If there really was something going on,

750
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,930
who would be so brazen as to

751
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,590
go to the cinema to be gossiped about by you guys?

752
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,190
As for what you're saying about that other team's jungler,

753
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,310
I don't know what's going on there.

754
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,880
After all, there were so many people in the cinema.

755
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,960
However,

756
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,970
there were indeed a few people

757
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,170
who sneaked in

758
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,660
after the lights went out.

759
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,430
As for who they were,

760
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,760
if you're so curious, why don't you go ask him yourself?

761
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,130
Smiling is being shady here.

762
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,410
She's obviously implying something about Xu Tailun, right?

763
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,040
If you ask me, she and Cheng definitely have something going on.

764
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,850
They're probably using Tailun as a cover.

765
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,220
[2020 OPL National League: Group A Round 3]

766
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,370
Dear Onmyoji Arena masters,

767
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,730
and all the viewers watching the live broadcast,

768
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,660
hello everyone.

769
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,780
Welcome to the 2020 Onmyoji Arena

770
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,450
Professional League event.

771
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,160
I'm your host, Xi Zhe.

772
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,880
The teams competing today are

773
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,780
Team ZGDX and Team DQ.Five.

774
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,560
The strength of these two teams can be said to be

775
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,680
evenly matched.

776
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,080
Who will come out on top?

777
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,680
Let's wait and see.

778
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,730
Once again, let's welcome them

779
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,510
with a warm round of applause!

780
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,730
Alright, please take your seats.

781
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,600
Everyone be careful this round.

782
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,440
I’ve got this uneasy feeling for some reason.

783
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,560
I don't know why.

784
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,350
You're always nervous about everyone.

785
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,150
Are you born in the year of the rabbit or something?

786
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,190
Alright, the lineups for both sides are locked in.

787
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,590
Let's look forward to the upcoming battle.

788
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,430
The match has just started.

789
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,060
What are they doing?

790
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,810
Where are they?

791
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,620
I don't know.

792
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,300
Maybe they're having a meeting somewhere.

793
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,950
Come on, get ready to take down Tong Yao.

794
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,900
Got it. Moving in.

795
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,270
They're up to something.

796
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,730
And Smiling is still unaware at this moment.

797
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,350
Go, now.

798
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,210
Suddenly, a coordinated gank strikes mid lane, targeting Smiling.

799
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,130
Smiling is caught completely off guard

800
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,840
and her teammates don’t have time to assist.

801
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,100
Within seconds, Smiling is eliminated.

802
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,870
DQ.Five secures first blood.

803
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,580
Sis, that was brutal.

804
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,010
These five people grouped up in the mid lane from the start.

805
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,670
What kind of strategy is this?

806
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,560
Suppressing the mid lane so hard in the early game.

807
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,080
Is this some kind of new tactic?
