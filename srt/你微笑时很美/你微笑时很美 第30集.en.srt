Up next, we will face Team ZGDX.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,680
We're looking forward to blowing them up again.

3
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,810
To be honest,

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,880
among all the semi-final opponents,

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,610
we’re only worried about ZGDX.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,910
ZGDX won't

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,510
fall in the same place twice.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,730
We are champions.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,100
I didn’t expect

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,570
our team would be so lucky to enter the top four.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,450
I think

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,220
Smiling must have prayed for me.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,000
Smiling,

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,970
let’s meet in the finals.

17
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,700
Beautiful. Here, God Ming.

18

Let's go.

Lu Yue.

24
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,590
Here’s one for Miss,

25
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
and one for Cheng.

26
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,220
Finals, let’s go!

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,840
[Also, a reminder that your KPI for the month hasn't been completed – Rui]

28

[Congratulations to Miss for making it to the annual finals with Cheng. The organization is very pleased.]

29
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,640
What are you looking at?

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
The day YQCB defeated FNATIC

31
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,410
and got their ticket to the national finals,

32
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,070
their team’s boss stood at the door,

33
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,660
holding a big stack of red packets.

34
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,030
One by one, the team members got off the bus and collected their packets.

35
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,510
The red packets were very thick too.

36
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,560
And we...

37
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,590
No.

38
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,740
Why?

39
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,750
We both made it to the finals.

40
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,280
Why did they get red envelopes

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,110
while we only get candy and cards?

42
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,640
We don't even get a good meal.

43
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,680
I feel it’s unfair.

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,410
I feel discriminated against.

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,390
Is it rarer for someone who ranked second in the midterm exams

46
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,270
to now aim for

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,070
first or second place in the finals,

48
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,270
or for someone who has always been

49
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,070
at the bottom of the class to now aim for the top spot?

50
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,630
Making it to the national finals

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,590
is simply meeting baseline expectations for us.

52
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,120
So, what's there to reward?

53
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,450
Here, have some candy.

54
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
Cheng, by the way,

55
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,990
I have something to tell you.

56
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,790
What's wrong?

57
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,240
Lu Sicheng! You're heartless.

58
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,650
K, what did you buy this time?

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,560
Face masks, Dopey.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,079
K, what's wrong with you?

61
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,920
Who are you calling Dopey?

62
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,590
Right after the match,

63
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,340
you two are already

64
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,350
close enough to give each other nicknames?

65
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,390
Shut up.

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,270
These are my new MIHOO face masks.

67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,790
We stay up all night training,

68
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,320
my skin dries out terribly.

69
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,670
This MIHOO mask is really hydrating.

70
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,120
Then I’ll try it too.

71
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,850
You're eating so much.

72
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,880
It's delicious.

73
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,020
Dopey.

74
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,390
Do you want to try?

75
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,230
Does this work?

76
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,310
Are you calling me or the mask?

77
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,790
Cat's reflexes are so slow they could circle the Earth three times.

78
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,950
You shut up too.

79
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,430
Everyone.

80
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,350
After this match,

81
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,190
we’re heading into the finals.

82
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,010
But I still want to remind you,

83
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,290
YQCB is no longer the team they used to be.

84
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,630
They defeated FNATIC

85
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,430
and reached the finals with us.

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,190
Back to business. Let’s cut the chatter.

87
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,909
From now on,

88
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,470
until the finals begin,

89
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,590
our entire base

90
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,400
will undergo isolated training.

91
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,780
Isolated training?

92
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,480
Is the club

93
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,140
planning to fully sponsor us?

94
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,110
To be specific,

95
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,110
you must guard against the other team like spies.

96
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,840
For example,

97
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,130
no meals, shopping, or private chats

98
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,400
with the other team’s rich boss lady.

99
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,300
No discussing strategies under the guise of playing with claw machines

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,190
with former teammates who are now our opponents.

101
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,790
Of course,

102
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,190
Pancake and Scallion are grounded too.

103
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,830
No interacting with their mid laner’s cat.

104
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,510
Wait.

105
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,010
Do you think we'd draw maps on the cats' backs?

106
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,010
Why don't you just

107
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,710
build a cement wall?

108
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,620
Make it soundproof against wiretapping.

109
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,630
A cement wall?

110
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,430
You might as well cement our mid laner’s door shut.

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,590
Why?

112
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,420
If you cement the mid laner's door,

113
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,820
how will Tong Yao get out?

114
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,970
Rui.

115
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,660
We should consider finding

116
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,130
a replacement for our top laner’s brain.

117
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,120
No, I can do it.

118
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,600
My brother won't let me play mid lane anyway.

119
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
-Seconded.
-Shut up.

120
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,830
Shut up.

121
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,710
Let's go.

122
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,630
Before we officially start isolated training,

123
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,110
let me treat you guys to a feast.

124
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,610
Long live Cheng!

125
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,930
I'm excited now.

126
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,110
Let's go, Dopey.

127
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,240
Let's have a feast. Don't call me that.

128
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,800
-Let’s go. Okay.
-Hurry up.

129
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,430
Come on. Drink up.

130
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,430
Isn't that DQ.Five?

131
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,650
What happened to them?

132
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,590
Their curfew is gone.

133
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,920
They got relegated.

134
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,750
While you guys were in the quarterfinals,

135
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,950
they were still fighting to stay in the league.

136
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,000
Nobody paid attention,

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,510
so there was no buzz about them.

138
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,310
They lost the relegation match?

139
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,770
They've been demoted?

140
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,330
They have to play the qualifiers now.

141
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,780
DQ.Five won't be in the next season of

142
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,920
OPL?

143
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,720
That's Ling Mao.

144
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,550
I know.

145
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,100
He’s the captain and support of DQ.Five,

146
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,790
an old player.

147
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,909
Please be careful.

148
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,630
Don’t cause any trouble.

149
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,690
This year...

150
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,220
Don’t make trouble this year.

151
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,770
Focus on the national finals.

152
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,470
After getting the World Championship ticket,

153
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,110
stand on the world stage

154
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,650
and bring glory to

155
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,670
OPL.

156
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,430
Guys,

157
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,990
we can’t carry the team again like last year.

158
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,750
I really love playing professionally.

159
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,090
I love the feeling of fighting alongside my teammates.

160
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,030
Even though I have many regrets,

161
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,530
I'm still happy.

162
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,510
Now, I’ve reached the end of my road,

163
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,870
but I know

164
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,940
someone will keep going,

165
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,230
and go further.

166
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,740
I hope you guys are the lucky ones.

167
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,500
Here.

168
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm leaving.

169
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,670
I'll see them off.

170
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,070
Take your time drinking.

171
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,630
Bye.

172
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,940
Bye.

173
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,750
He said "carry the team",

174
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,790
what does he mean?

175
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,940
When Team ZGDX

176
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,470
unexpectedly missed the national finals,

177
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,080
the team who replaced us to enter the World Championship

178
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,909
was Team DQ.Five.

179
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,039
Boss, check please.

180
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,990
However, after Xu Tailun left,

181
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,820
they lost their core again.

182
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,030
In the second half of the National League, they didn’t win a single match,

183
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,690
and with a last-place finish,

184
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,390
they were relegated to the qualifiers.

185
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,980
It can be said that

186
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,070
their fans went from being
hopeful to despairing.

187
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,670
That process, like being slowly boiled alive,

188
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,780
was agonizing.

189
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,950
It was a farewell dinner.

190
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,150
They're disbanding?

191
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,150
For a team

192
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,960
to fall into the qualifiers

193
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,590
and try to climb back with the same lineup,

194
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,620
it’s impossible.

195
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,190
After all, the pro league is a practical world.

196
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,460
Once a team gets relegated,

197
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,710
the good players

198
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,590
will be bought by other clubs

199
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,790
and continue to join

200
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,470
OPL

201
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,800
to play for other teams.

202
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,270
The bad players

203
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,360
have to find another team on their own.

204
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,310
For teams that got relegated to qualifiers,

205
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,310
to put it bluntly,

206
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,880
they're just empty shells.

207
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,550
Yes.

208
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,310
And for five players to work together

209
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,150
to climb back from the qualifiers to the pro league,

210
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,830
OPL,

211
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,830
even a cheap novel

212
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,550
wouldn’t write about something so unrealistic.

213
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,120
So,

214
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,140
for Team DQ.Five's players,

215
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,390
their team was

216
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,380
essentially disbanded

217
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,630
the moment they lost the relegation match.

218
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,150
Whether they’ll ever

219
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,950
sit together, play games,

220
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,870
eat, or chat like before,

221
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,200
is all up to fate.

222
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,210
So, getting back to the point,

223
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,520
let’s cherish the time we have together.

224
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,230
That was close.

225
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,230
Our team

226
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,110
almost had a farewell dinner too.

227
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,590
Hey.

228
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,850
I don’t want to have a farewell dinner.

229
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,810
But I wouldn’t mind another bowl of

230
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,350
your potato beef curry.

231
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,430
-I want some too.
-Me too.

232
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,030
Me too.

233
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,070
Me too.

234
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:15,990
Me too.

235
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,750
Me too.

236
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,030
And make it the kind with hidden meat at the bottom.

237
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:20,950
Okay.

238
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,330
After we beat YQCB,

239
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,030
I’ll fulfill all your requests.

240
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,110
For now, let’s toast.

241
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,630
Come on.

242
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,710
Let's toast.

243
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,630
Through thorns, on blazing sands,

244
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,390
never give up!

245
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,850
Cheers!

246
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,670
Cheers!

247
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,690
Despair.

248
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,710
It’s like receiving a death sentence,

249
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,710
a slow death.

250
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,640
How could there not be despair?

251
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,950
But now,

252
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
I can finally have a moment of peace.

253
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,510
It's time to have a good rest.

254
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,630
For us

255
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,630
and for you, our lovely fans.

256
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,830
Goodbye,

257
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,910
Team DQ.Five.

258
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,500
You once had glory and honor.

259
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,870
We'll go wherever you go.

260
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,850
Going to the qualifiers isn’t scary.

261
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,850
We'll be with you.

262
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,030
Mao,

263
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,790
will we ever see you again, smiling and lifting

264
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,230
the Spring Tournament trophy like you did that year?

265
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,900
After the disappointment, I don’t know what to do.

266
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,760
I’ve never liked a team this much.

267
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,380
I probably won't watch

268
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,470
OPL ever again.

269
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,000
I feel so exhausted.

270
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,240
Why did I fall in love with esports?

271
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,030
Sometimes, I tell myself,

272
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,270
to support the Korean Team TAT

273
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,430
or Team ZGDX.

274
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,930
Wouldn’t that be nice?

275
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,790
They always win matches.

276
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,940
How happy their fans must be.

277
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,350
I’ve told myself this countless times,

278
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,390
but I still end up eagerly

279
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,470
watching your games.

280
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,400
Fans are indeed disappointed when you lose.

281
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,470
But then they optimistically believe

282
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,270
that you can win again next time.

283
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,200
So stupid.

284
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,290
What else can we do?

285
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,610
I'm desperate too.

286
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,690
I can’t break free.

287
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,890
I can’t escape.

288
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,190
I didn't start supporting them during their peak

289
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,920
and I won't abandon them during their low points.

290
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,550
Cheng!

291
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,780
Cheng!

292
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,590
Cheng!

293
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,070
Cheng!

294
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,950
Cheng!

295
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,470
Cheng.

296
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,550
Guess what I'm thinking.

297
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,350
What?

298
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,110
When I first met you,

299
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,950
it was just like this.

300
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,690
Back then, I could only look at you from afar.

301
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,030
But now,

302
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,840
I can stand beside you.

303
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,660
Childish.

304
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,450
But it's very cute.

305
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,190
I like it.

306
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,240
Are all these gifts from fans?

307
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,500
They're so delicious.

308
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,730
Don’t eat too much.

309
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,440
Everyone, take it easy.

310
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,630
The fact that we’ve made it to the finals

311
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,090
shows we have the ability.

312
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,530
Don't stress too much.

313
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,610
Since we're in Shanghai,

314
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,070
I’m giving everyone the afternoon off

315
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,600
to go and enjoy yourselves.

316
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,030
Enjoy what?

317
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,750
Visiting a hyped up city like this?

318
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,870
I’d rather spend a day battling it out on Onmyoji Arena.

319
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,790
Since we're here, let's go and have some fun.

320
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,390
Yeah.

321
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,470
Imagine going home

322
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,190
and someone asks

323
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,510
what you ate in Shanghai.

324
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,450
If you say

325
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,620
"I stayed in the hotel and played games,"

326
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,830
that’d be embarrassing.

327
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,440
Right.

328
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,270
Where do you want to go later?

329
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,320
Anywhere.

330
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,390
I'll go wherever you go.

331
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,990
Shopping?

332
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,000
But there’s nothing I really want to buy.

333
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,630
A walking ATM is standing next to you,

334
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,960
and you’re saying that?

335
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,210
You think I’m after your money?

336
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,570
Are you after my money?

337
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,390
Alright, sir.

338
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,270
What's wrong with you?

339
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,430
Why are you so eager to spend on me?

340
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,150
When you like someone,

341
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,650
you just want to spoil them.

342
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,910
If you had ten bucks, you'd spend nine-fifty on her

343
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,350
and keep the rest for a bun

344
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,000

Hello, Jinyang.

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,990
We are discussing

365
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,750
whether to tour Shanghai today.

How are you planning to celebrate?

This is the first time the two of us

371
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,110
I think that’s worth commemorating.

372
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,660
What should I get you this year?

373
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,820
A bag, shoes,

374

I'll let your man get you the jewelry and wedding dress.

If you say it’s your birthday,

381
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,710
he could probably buy the Oriental Pearl Tower

382
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,710
and rename it to Happy Birthday to My Wife Tower.

383

Please don’t tell him it’s my birthday today.

If he actually buys something extravagant,

385

I’d have to sell myself in pieces to repay him.

386

who could give me something so expensive

389
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,550
that I’d feel I couldn’t repay it even if I sold myself too.

Why wouldn’t she just tell me herself?

399

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,470
You...

516
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,500
Luckily, I moved fast.

517
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,030
Otherwise, the stores would’ve been closed.

518
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,150
Happy birthday, Esports Mulan.

519
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,430
Are you two done being mushy?

520
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,270
The rest of us are really hungry.

521
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,910
Can we eat the cake now?

522
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,440
Actually, I wasn’t even planning to celebrate my birthday.

523
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,510
The match is coming up soon.

524
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,670
Whether or not I celebrate doesn’t really matter.

525
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,790
Even if there’s a match,

526
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,710
you should celebrate your birthday.

527
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,180
Yes.

528
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,870
Hurry up and make a wish.

529
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,140
Yes, make a wish.

530
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,000
A Smile pendant?

531
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,500
A pendant this year.

532
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,330
Next year, a diamond ring

533
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,530
with a marriage certificate included.

534
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,240
Does it look good?

535
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,750
Yes.

536
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,430
Everything looks good on you.

537
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,610
So romantic.

538
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,210
Wait.

539
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,070
It's my ward, shouldn't you guys be paying more attention to me?

540
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,000
Can’t be helped.

541
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,150
Tonight’s spotlight belongs to the dual carry pair.

542
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,750
By the way,

543
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,210
I prepared gifts for everyone today too.

544
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,290
Usually,

545
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,160
as your butler,

546
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,150
I’m always thinking about you.

547
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,100
On the battlefield,

548
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,310
I can’t cut through thorns for you

549
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,240
but I can handle all the logistics.

550
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:43,950
So,

551
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,460
in order to ensure everything goes well,

552
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,350
and to keep all bad luck

553
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,570
away from you,

554
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,480
I specifically arranged for someone to prepare

555
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,510
this.

556
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,440
A charm that covers every aspect of life,

557
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,790
from eating and living

558
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,150
to emotions and moods.

559
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,470
Each of you gets one.

560
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,630
To ensure that you shine

561
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,870
on the national finals stage.

562
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,300
Here.

563
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,750
Thanks.

564
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,380
Not bad.

565
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,550
What’s with those expressions?

566
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,920
Think about it.

567
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,910
Throughout this league journey,

568
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,670
we’ve had injuries and ailments.

569
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,440
As for this,

570
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,540
you can believe in it,

571
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,990
or if you don't, just use it as a talisman

572
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,890
or a keepsake.

573
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,060
Just wear it. It won't hurt you, right?

574
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,500
By the way,

575
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,390
this doesn’t mean the club doesn’t believe in you.

576
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,590
I’ve already sworn

577
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,230
to take home the championship trophy from the finals

578
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,500
and head to the world stage.

579
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,490
Otherwise, I'll...

580
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,090
Resign?

581
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,630
He wouldn’t bear to.

582
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,580
Even if he had to be the bus driver,

583
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,430
he'd follow us.

584
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,830
Right?

585
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,470
Well...

586
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,910
But to be honest,

587
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,350
no matter what the result is,

588
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,030
I'll always support you.

589
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,880
No matter what happens,

590
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,830
sell me out, I’ll take the blame.

591
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,990
Fine, give me one.

592
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,350
I want to make a wish too.

593
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,350
I’ve seen those influencers

594
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,550
say these charms are pretty effective.

595
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,910
Does it really work?

596
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,440
Whatever you wish for,

597
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,570
I’ll make it happen.

598
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,500
Cheng, I have a wish too.

599
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,910
I have a wish as well.

600
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,830
Do we get to fulfill ours too?

601
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,550
Carries,

602
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,550
what you two are doing isn’t great.

603
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,390
I told everyone to relax,

604
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,740
but you two are taking it too far.

605
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,950
Our priority now

606
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,230
is to win the national championship.

607
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,790
Yes. You have a long way to go.

608
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,270
Please, everyone, be a little more serious.

609
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:19,750
Really.

610
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,310
I really don’t want to end up as a bus driver.

611
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,920
My wish is

612
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,550
is to defeat YQCB,

613
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,710
win the national championship

614
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,500
and head to the world stage!

615
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,150
Yes.

616
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,810
That's all?

617
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,870
To celebrate,

618
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,520
how about we go eat some meat?

619
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,350
Good idea. You still want to eat?

620
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,680
Pang, behave yourself.

621
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,910
What’s coming up isn’t just the national finals.

622
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,720
It’s the ultimate showdown of Light and Shadow.

623
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,430
After you get discharged, you need to train properly.

624
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,140
After that,

625
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,270
I'll treat you to crab roe noodles.

626
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,800
If you don't practice, you won’t even get tea.

627
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,910
Wow.

628
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,070
You two, one giving a carrot and the other a stick.

629
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,950
Your coordination is on point.

630
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,550
That’s what we call well-intentioned advice.

631
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,950
God Ming,

632
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,550
what did you wish for?

633
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,710
What else could it be?

634
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,750
Of course, for us to defeat YQCB smoothly.

635
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,610
One more thing.

636
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,030
For ZGDX to never disappear from the stage.

637
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,560
Bro, why are you bringing up the past again?

638
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,130
God Ming, you believe in this too?

639
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,910
Sometimes,

640
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,590
people do need a bit of luck.

641
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,350
You’ve already proven yourselves

642
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,630
as the world’s top professional players.

643
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,110
For the rest, as Rui said,

644
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,830
we just need a little bit more luck.

645
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,110
As long as we stick together,

646
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,790
all our wishes will come true.

647
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,770
Yes. Come on.

648
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,070
Come!

649
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:25,930
Come on.

650
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,110
ZGDX,

651
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,540
let’s go!

652
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,440
Let’s go!

653
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,070
Let’s go!

654
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,190
This guy

655
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,150
likes to hide here.

656
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:50,550
So

657
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,550
we must be careful during the match.

658
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,730
And I've been practicing these shikigami

659
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,170
using Tong Yao's videos.

660
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,210
Pope is back.

661
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,030
Why did he get so many claw machine toys today?

662
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,790
Does it

663
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,310
represent how nervous he feels?

664
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,860
So many.

665
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,780
Are they for the fans during the finals?

666
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,540
Pope.

667
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,660
We just analyzed

668
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,900
all of ZGDX’s national league matches

669
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,230
and summarized their double-carries' habits.

670
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,630
Do you want to take a look?

671
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,390
Pope?

672
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,660
What's wrong with him?

673
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,100
Ever since he came back, he hasn’t seemed right.

674
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,670
Yeah, he's been gloomy.

675
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,310
Did something happen to him?

676
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,970
How would I know? I don't know.

677
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,340
Liang Sheng.

678
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,790
My hands are sweating.

679
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,440
My heart is beating a little fast.

680
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,590
What's wrong with me?

681
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,230
Nervous.

682
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,380
Nervous?

683
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,040
It's normal.

684
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,160
Have a Coke

685
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,520
to calm your nerves.

686
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,360
I’ve never been nervous

687
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,990
before a match.

688
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,290
Think about it.

689
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,730
This is the national finals.

690
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,670
Besides,

691
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,340
it's your final battle with Lu Sicheng.

692
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,590
I think

693
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,400
it’s only natural for you to feel nervous.

694
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,160
I’m already 26 this year.

695
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,480
So?

696
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,590
So,

697
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,400
before I came to China,

698
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,750
I didn’t see it

699
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,310
as a true battlefield.

700
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,230
I just wanted

701
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,890
to make the final stretch of my career

702
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,720
a little more comfortable.

703
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,430
And then?

704
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,350
I don't know.

705
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,780
Maybe I didn't expect it

706
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,310
to be so difficult.

707
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,010
You guys made me...

708
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,070
What’s the phrase again?

709
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,510
You've opened my eyes.

710
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,230
-Sometimes…
-Opened his eyes?

711
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:05,910
He's praising us.

712
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,870
Some of my decisions

713
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,000
might have been just to beat Chessman.

714
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,710
But you all still...

715
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,710
You all still give me...

716
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,600
absolute trust.

717
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,190
Yes!

718
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,060
That's it.

719
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,930
Of course.

720
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,190
You’ve always been an excellent player.

721
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,440
That's right.

722
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,550
So,

723
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,320
you made me feel like

724
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,750
we have a chance to reach an even higher stage.

725
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,230
Even though we’re just a team that barely avoided relegation,

726
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,430
we’ve come all the way

727
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,880
to the national finals.

728
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,270
Nothing is impossible.

729
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,400
Yes, for our dreams!

730
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,190
Bro.

731
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,870
I want to go to the world stage with you.

732
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,400
Alright.

733
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,700
Let’s win the national champion first!

734
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,920
-Come on.
-Okay.

735
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,550
YQCB,

736
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,720
just a bunch of noobs!

737
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,910
What are you doing? Let’s do this properly.

738
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,670
One more time.

739
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,750
Three, two, one.

740
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,350
YQCB,

741
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,970
let's dominate together!

742
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,230
Go, go, go!

743
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,370
Come on!

744
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,610
Come on!

745
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,110
Here.

746
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,670
Have you thought about your other wishes?

747
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,870
World peace.

748
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,660
Do you have to be so tacky?

749
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,910
I hope we can win the championship.

750
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,050
That's all?

751
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,910
Not just the national champion,

752
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,260
but also the world champion.

753
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,110
That's all?

754
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,510
You’re really not going to tell me?

755
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,710
If I tell you my wish, it won't come true.

756
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,150
I don't believe that.

757
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,630
Other than me,

758
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,190
who can control my fate?

759
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,110
Our future belongs to you and me alone.

760
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,020
Here.

761
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,730
What about you?

762
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,910
If I had to say what I wish for,

763
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,150
I hope

764
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,610
I can stay by your side forever.

765
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,950
ZGDX is ready.

766
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,910
If you're okay, we can start anytime.

767
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,030
I’ll handle things over here.

768
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,430
Okay.

769
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,270
Okay, got it.

770
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,950
I'm so nervous.

771
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,470
What are you nervous about? I'm nervous.

772
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,350
Didn't you look in the mirror

773
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,850
only a thousand times before leaving today?

774
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,860
Are you still nervous?

775
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,300
Don't bully me.

776
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,330
I’m not used to big occasions.

777
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,100
Get used to it.

778
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,190
You're going to

779
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,010
conquer the world stage with me.

780
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,240
Players from both teams, please enter the stage.

781
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,310
Let’s go!

782
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,150
Ladies and gentlemen,

783
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,350
welcome to the 2020

784
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,990
OPL

785
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,390
National Finals.

786
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,690
Today’s showdown is between two strong teams,

787
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,560
a fight between Light and Shadow.

788
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,470
ZGDX and YQCB,

789
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,630
these two powerhouse rivals,

790
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,630
which team will emerge victorious?

791
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,550
Let's wait and see.

792
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,390
ZGDX is a star-studded team.

793
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,290
They’ve been covered in thorns and treaded on burning sands.

794
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,590
A team that has faced setbacks at their peak,

795
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,989
and climbed back

796
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,909
to the top.

797
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,989
YQCB, on the other hand,

798
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,219
started as an underdog fighting relegation.

799
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,510
With the arrival of Pope,

800
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,590
their potential was developed,

801
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,830
bringing them all the way

802
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,070
to the national finals.

803
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,670
Now they compete for the highest honor

804
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,750
of OPL.

805
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,469
Alright, to the live audience,

806
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,030
let's count down together

807
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,320
to welcome them!

808
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,320
Let's go!

809
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:34,909
Ten.

810
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,110
Nine.

811
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:42,830
Eight.

812
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,310
Seven.

813
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,420
Six.

814
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,020
Five.

815
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,020
Four.

816
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:53,989
Three.

817
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,020
Two.

818
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,460
One.

819
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,230
At this moment,

820
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,390
I declare that

821
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,750
the final battle of

822
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,870
the 2020 event

823
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,710
has now begun!
