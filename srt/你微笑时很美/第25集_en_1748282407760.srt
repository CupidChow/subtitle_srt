1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What?

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:01,920
You're coming to Shenzhen.

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,720
Why are you here?

4
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,920
Don't scare them.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,720
5 million.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,000
Leave my son.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The End

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 1

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The End

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Episode 1

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The End

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's all.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You guys go out first.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Come on.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You two wait.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The End

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Sit down.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There's no one else.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You said you had a crush.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I knew from the internet.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you think it's appropriate?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mom, I've said it many times.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You don't have to come.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't want to come.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't want to come.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If I don't come,

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
will you make your own decision

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
about all your life?

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You don't even ask me

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
if I'm your dad.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've been a grown-up for a long time.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're still my son.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Besides,

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you're in a relationship.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I can't even look at you.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Tong Yao,

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
do you think it's appropriate

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
to do that?

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mom, I like her.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No one can change this.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You like who you want to be with.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's your own business.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You don't have to ask for our opinion.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think in the internet,

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the road you two are on

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
will be very rough.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mom, don't worry.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No matter what happens in the future,

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll face it with her.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
ZGDX's announcement.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ZGDX's electronic entertainment agency,

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Lu Si Cheng and Tong Yao

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
are currently in the network.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you to the two players

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and ZGDX's team for their support and support.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This club is free and open.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It won't affect the training

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and competition.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It won't interfere with the personal relationship

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
between the members.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
For the relationship between the two,

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the club's full members

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
have given the best blessing.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For the online youth criminal Lu Si Cheng

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and Tong Yao's public opinion,

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
this club will continue to pay attention

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and keep pursuing the youth discussion

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and the legal responsibility of the person who turns the table.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In the case of the two people who are involved in the crime,

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the club will take all the legal means

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and pursue the legal responsibility of the person who turns the table.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't worry.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you again to the media and fans

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
for your concern, tolerance and love.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is a personal issue

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
caused by Lu Si Cheng and Tong Yao.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The social resources waste

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
is deeply apologizing.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I hope you can all work together

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
to build a good network environment.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hey, really?

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is Guan Bo and the girl really just now

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
just missing the two hundred years of good luck

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and going to the cabinet?

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You two...

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Aren't you going to take the sugar?

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, I'm worried.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you worried about?

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I did something wrong.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm afraid this time I was too impulsive

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and didn't think of the consequences.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What consequences?

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
About...

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
what you're going to face.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If you're afraid,

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll be affected by those rumors online.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then you don't have to worry.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm fine.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Actually, at the beginning,

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I was a little afraid.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I always felt that if I made public,

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
there would be a lot of opposition and doubt.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So there are a lot of concerns.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What's more,

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
it will affect you.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Just like the past Jian Yang.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He started to regret being together.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then he lied and cheated.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He finally went on a journey.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But later...

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How was it later?

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Later I knew

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you and Jian Yang were going to be together.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's different.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So these things won't happen.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm at ease.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've prepared myself

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to take all the violent threats.

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not afraid.

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're so strong.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll be as strong as you.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The child has grown up.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I thought you'd be afraid

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
of crying all night.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's so far away.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My goodness.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I didn't expect that we would make a car

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and eat a dog food.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's really a lemon tree.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You and I are in the same tree.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,200
Captain,

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Tong Yao is still there.

139
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Tell me.

140
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,000
It'd be the best if Tong Yao?

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No idea.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't care if Tong Yao is dead.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I guess you're not gonna live anymore.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm just going to pay attention to the scene.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Wow, it's live broadcast.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The first time I saw a big screen.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's live broadcast.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Is it because you're a big topic these days?

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Is it a hot pot?

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He He.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're so funny.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm live broadcasting.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're so funny.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now, I just want to pay attention to the scene.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm playing rank training now.

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't open live broadcast time.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When will you open it?

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll open a live broadcast.

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why don't you practice?

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I used to open live broadcast.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you don't broadcast today,

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the live broadcast time at the end of the month is not enough.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can only sleep live broadcast for you.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Sleep live broadcast at the bottom of the city.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The bottom of the city.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm warning you.

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Say it's Brother Cheng.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What did you say?

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Brother Cheng is indeed a great AD.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Now,

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
let's rank the world first three.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This AD is probably sleeping now.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
After all,

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry for being the head of the family.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I have to hold my hand and grab my hair.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll walk along the road in the future.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sorry.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's cold again.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sorry.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're so lucky.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's cold.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What's the matter?

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Brother Cheng, you're with Qian.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, Qian San.

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't say first.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
After all,

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
there is an AD that is similar to his level.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Will you be caught on the floor?

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
When will you break up?

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Break up?

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I found a boyfriend by myself.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Why do you want to break up?

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're in love.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You've changed.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You were rarely killed on the line.

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Waiting for a ZGDX explosion.

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're not in a mood to play light.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I also think I'm not good at playing light.

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But I think Korean people are very good at it.

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's why I want to practice.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Otherwise, the world will be in a mess.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you practice more, you will be in a bad mood.

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Isn't that good?

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Where's Brother Cheng?

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Did Brother Cheng get up?

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ask him to start the live broadcast.

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Our captain should be up.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Our captain?

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We...

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're so stubborn.

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're not good enough.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Brother Cheng is here.

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm the ZGDC.

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're childish.

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're not childish?

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The light of the light of the dark forest of Yisha.

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If you dare to take the game,

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll break your head.

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm practicing.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Go away.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I've used light.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's not the way you use it.

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on.

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll demonstrate.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're an AD.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Why did you call me中 class?

227
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll try.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't switch.

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Leave.

230
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,360
Hurry up.

231
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,440
You are going to fail.

232
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,760
Jiaoxi,

233
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,320
this is the moment for you to see Xiaolong's family.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,720
Don't go.

235
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,320
I know,

236
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
our family will remember you all the time

237
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,240
and wish you a broken child.

238
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm live

239
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,440
I know

240
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Really laugh

241
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,440
Ao Pour

242
00:10:47,720 --> 00:11:07,280
Havingado

243
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,680
The strength of the old card is really small.

244
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,880
Since the old card is completely connected to the ZGDX,

245
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,280
it's the power of the opening.

246
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,480
In the last match,

247
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,480
ZGDX's old cat and old K's match is quite different.

248
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,080
It seems to be the first match.

249
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,680
The old cat was almost caught by the old card.

250
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,280
The old card's play is also not visible.

251
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,800
Today, ZGDX's top-tier

252
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
seems to be a bit like

253
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,680
the old death doesn't matter.

254
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,480
That's right.

255
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
I don't know if it's because of the influence of the outside.

256
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
The situation today is good.

257
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,880
Good job.

258
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
You take the ball.

259
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,080
The score is 0-1.

260
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,280
The state of the ZGDX this time is still very soft.

261
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,680
The second match is a famous match.

262
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,480
Is ZGDX really strong

263
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
or is it just a game?

264
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
After this match,

265
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
there will be a direct result.

266
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
The ZGDX team may have been still strong before.

267
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,280
Now, both C-class and C-class are in love.

268
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,680
How can they still be so confident?

269
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
That's right.

270
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
Let's gank.

271
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,400
tolerant

272
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,880
Send both of you to my site.

273
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,920
Woohoo.

274
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,280
molt

275
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,200
righteous

276
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
Okay.

277
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,920
They're on the road.

278
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,400
Okay.

279
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,160
Come on.

280
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,080
Wait for me.

281
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,760
I'll be there soon.

282
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
This way.

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,520
Alpha's Qingqing and Tsumu

284
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,000
seem to be going to

285
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,520
hold the back road of the old cat.

286
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,200
The second team is on the way to the horse.

287
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,360
Ke is on the lower side of the road.

288
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
He's going to pass,

289
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,440
but seeing the other four,

290
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,640
the old cat is also in a hurry.

291
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,800
He's going to catch the wild.

292
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,520
Oh no.

293
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,880
The old cat is dead again.

294
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,440
He's not catching the first.

295
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,880
The map is not round.

296
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,320
It's going up.

297
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,040
Oh no.

298
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,120
The four of them are fighting.

299
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,440
My teammates.

300
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Ke is running away.

301
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,440
He's going to

302
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,400
catch another one.

303
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,080
It's meaningless.

304
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,760
Let's fight.

305
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,560
Go and get the fat.

306
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,760
You can still fight.

307
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,720
Don't let them down.

308
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
Don't let them down.

309
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,280
You can come to my place to eat ice cream.

310
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,680
I'll go to see what you eat.

311
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,400
Let him eat ice cream.

312
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,720
Then you can eat my wild.

313
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,600
You're a good person.

314
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,560
You're cheap.

315
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
What's wrong with eating the wild?

316
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,520
You haven't even

317
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
brushed your teeth since the opening.

318
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,840
You're blaming me.

319
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
I didn't use the four of them to help you.

320
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,240
I saw them in the second floor

321
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,920
when they came.

322
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,240
I couldn't get through.

323
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,080
They're blaming Qi Ling.

324
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,720
They don't want to do anything to you.

325
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,160
I have no choice.

326
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,000
And your economy

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,560
has been back in other ways.

328
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
I don't believe that after the game,

329
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,720
we can see the real economy map.

330
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,920
Shut up.

331
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,720
Do you want to blame

332
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,440
the enemy directly?

333
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,520
Tang YiBo.

334
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,400
Coming.

335
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,240
Got it.

336
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,000
The four-man team

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,720
jumped out of the grass

338
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,840
and hit a group of opponents.

339
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,440
Go.

340
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,560
Go.

341
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,120
Go back.

342
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,320
Go back.

343
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,680
The game has been going on.

344
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,320
The previous game

345
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,960
was caught too many times.

346
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,160
I guess they're looking for another way.

347
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,280
But K is still

348
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,720
playing under the field.

349
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,240
Look.

350
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,960
The cat is coming.

351
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,640
He wants to

352
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,720
take revenge on the enemy

353
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,960
in the situation of the game.

354
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,040
We're in the middle.

355
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,240
Come.

356
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,720
We're in the middle.

357
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,480
We don't want to retreat.

358
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,000
The game is over.

359
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,480
Yes.

360
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,680
Let's go.

361
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,520
They're retreating.

362
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
The cat is blocking the shot.

363
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,720
We must push this game.

364
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,320
Don't open it.

365
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,080
Good.

366
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,440
Yu Ze is changing the scene.

367
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,320
A group of opponents

368
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,040
is coming.

369
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,120
Go.

370
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,840
This time,

371
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,920
you see,

372
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,600
the cat and the cat

373
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
always come in a tight line.

374
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,360
But today,

375
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,000
no K.

376
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,680
The cat is...

377
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,320
Hit.

378
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,880
Be gentle.

379
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,600
Be gentle.

380
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,360
I have the ability.

381
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,920
Two people

382
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,000
can't keep the cat and the cat.

383
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
The cat is all alone.

384
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,480
But the cat just now

385
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
helped him take revenge.

386
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,400
The economy has improved.

387
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,040
We're in the middle of the game.

388
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,360
We'll take a step back later.

389
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
OK.

390
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Pay attention to the people in the middle.

391
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,520
Keep a close eye on the line.

392
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,120
Keep the line.

393
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,640
Xiao Xiao, did you notice?

394
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,080
If the team fight

395
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,760
was because K.

396
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,120
was peeking the tower in the lower part,

397
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,600
after everyone left the game,

398
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,920
K. and the cat

399
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
still have their own ways.

400
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,680
Indeed.

401
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,400
ZGDX is in a good relationship.

402
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,320
But it's a bit of a mess today.

403
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,520
The cat, you push the cat.

404
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,400
We'll take the shot.

405
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,520
OK.

406
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,680
ZGDX

407
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,480
is in the middle of the river.

408
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,640
If the cat's lower part

409
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,520
can successfully

410
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
push the cat's other side,

411
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,080
this shot

412
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,040
will be a loss.

413
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,640
That's right.

414
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,360
Wait for me.

415
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,120
Wait for me.

416
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,680
The cat's entourage

417
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,480
has been lost.

418
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,960
It's a miracle that it's in the middle.

419
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,360
It's a good match.

420
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Why is the cat still in the tower?

421
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,200
But the cat

422
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,120
is in a bad condition.

423
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
It's hard to see ZGDX.

424
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,520
Come on.

425
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,320
Give me a hug.

426
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,640
Give me a hug.

427
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,720
They're coming out.

428
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,520
The cat, come here and watch the team.

429
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll wait for the cat in the position.

430
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,840
The cat is still in the lower part.

431
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,600
But ZGDX

432
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
is already in the middle of the game.

433
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
It's time for the five of us to come.

434
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,040
Come on.

435
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,840
Let's take a look.

436
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,520
Let's take a look.

437
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,000
The cat will face

438
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,160
the situation of four to five.

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,160
ZGDX

440
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,960
is already in the middle of the game.

441
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
He's out.

442
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,800
Watch the team.

443
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,480
Watch the team.

444
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
The position of the ZGDX

445
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,720
is now relatively safe.

446
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,440
But his teammates

447
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,880
can't hold it anymore.

448
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
The cat is down.

449
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,200
The cat's entourage is too fast.

450
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,800
I can't hold a support.

451
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
The cat is still in the lower part.

452
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,680
Yuan Tinggou is a jumpy.

453
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
ZGDX is in the middle of the game.

454
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,280
The cat's entourage is already in the middle of the game.

455
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,680
ZGDX must be lost.

456
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
The cat is still in the lead.

457
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,720
K can only watch the snake

458
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,640
being taken away in the grass.

459
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,080
ZGDX, watch the team.

460
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
The team will be eliminated.

461
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,840
ZGDX is starting to play the big snake.

462
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,080
The big snake is starting to play the big snake.

463
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
K has no way

464
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,600
to hide in the grass.

465
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,680
K can only grab the big snake.

466
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,600
Can you grab it?

467
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,680
K was killed by the cat.

468
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,800
K was killed by the cat.

469
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,120
What are you doing?

470
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,520
You can't even hold a cat.

471
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,160
I'm not a monster.

472
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,880
Can't you see?

473
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,560
You can't grab the big snake.

474
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,320
It's my fault.

475
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,240
It's not your fault.

476
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,000
The cat can be magical.

477
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Why can't you be magical?

478
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You can't see my blood.

479
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,920
Come and see me.

480
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,240
Stop fighting.

481
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,520
Come on.

482
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,760
Guard the game.

483
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,200
Guard the game.

484
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Come on.

485
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,680
Bring the ice to the high ground.

486
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,040
But the second player is also very fast.

487
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,280
Return to the high ground quickly.

488
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,120
Back to the high ground.

489
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,560
Back to the high ground.

490
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,800
Black can't steal the tower.

491
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,360
He can only head back.

492
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,200
ZGDX is in the top position.

493
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,840
He's sent too many times.

494
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,800
Look at the data map.

495
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,680
Only two players.

496
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,160
And the economy is poor.

497
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,480
The big snake is lost.

498
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,200
If ZGDX

499
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,680
doesn't change the strategy,

500
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,600
it's hard to play.

501
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,560
Alpha must be

502
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,680
trying to push the high ground.

503
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,560
After this game,

504
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,200
the team is fighting.

505
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
It feels like ZGDX

506
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
is already a little bit scattered.

507
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,480
The player's mentality

508
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,520
may be a little bit confused.

509
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:14,840
Yes.

510
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,440
If Alpha's

511
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,480
strong force is pushed,

512
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,400
he will win.

513
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
He's coming.

514
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,400
I want to let him

515
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,040
go to the back to see Alpha.

516
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,120
But he's controlled.

517
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,680
The cat is in the field.

518
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,160
Is there any point in this game?

519
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,440
This game,

520
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,160
K is already hanging up.

521
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,480
I want to see the cat alone.

522
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,360
K is dead.

523
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,800
He's coming.

524
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
It's too late.

525
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,320
Yes.

526
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,600
Retreat.

527
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,280
Retreat.

528
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,000
Alpha is here.

529
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,160
He's going to be shot.

530
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,440
Can they still go out?

531
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,000
Come on.

532
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,480
Come on.

533
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,040
Come on.

534
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,920
The money is still not enough.

535
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,600
The money is still not enough.

536
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,040
Come on.

537
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,680
At this time,

538
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,240
the enemy team

539
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,340
is already totally치

540
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,520
ி

541
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:46,700
조

542
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,840
R.?

543
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,400
Let's see.

544
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,600
Or maybe it's because

545
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,520
they are fighting toward Attina.

546
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,320
They were hit one hand

547
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,560
but didn't cooperate.

548
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,000
They finished the goal

549
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,480
and they are ready to

550
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,800
win the next game.

551
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,760
At that time,

552
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,280
Alpha's

553
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,800
wascharge is not too good.

554
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,600
Here it is.

555
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,680
230 YO

556
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,440
another 1 e post

557
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,000
and a failure.

558
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,240
He's already

559
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,400
hitting it seriously.

560
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,440
Alpha,

561
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,480
Alpha's

562
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,520
is going into a差.

563
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,400
And he's going into the Hero Parallel.

564
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,520
He's not going to watch.

565
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes!

566
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
The sound of the first half of the match.

567
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,240
ZGDX has also passed the first half of the whole national team.

568
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Congratulations to the Alpha team for winning the match.

569
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Congratulations to the Alpha team.

570
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
I have to think about this match.

571
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,240
It's about the flying wings of ZGDX.

572
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Do you think ZGDX will fall down because of the double C?

573
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,240
And the whole club will not be able to reach the top?

574
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
What's wrong?

575
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
I thought of the ball.

576
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
You're back.

577
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
I'm not in a good condition today.

578
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,240
It's normal to lose to the old team like Alpha.

579
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
It's okay. Let's cheer up.

580
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Yes.

581
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,240
The next week, the fanatic team will be the first to win.

582
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
The wing line is growing.

583
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
And the yqcb team are all the opponent that can't be missed.

584
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
The next team is really strong now.

585
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,240
Since the yqcb team joined, the whole team's style has changed.

586
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
It's like a play-in.

587
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Even their captain's support has become the god of support in the former position.

588
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Brother, chicken.

589
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,240
If they get the chance, it's hard for the opponent to turn around.

590
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
If we don't want to lose in the next match,

591
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
we'll have to watch my team play.

592
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
No matter if they go up or not.

593
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
We'll have to watch our team's economy go up.

594
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Should we continue?

595
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
You two have such a mentality.

596
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
It's not impossible to lose in the next match.

597
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
My god.

598
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
K's eyes are so scary.

599
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
I'm scared.

600
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
What are you scared of?

601
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Oh no.

602
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Our team and uncle's relationship is broken.

603
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
What?

604
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
Old cat and old K.

605
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
They are both naughty.

606
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,240
They need someone to take a piece of the抽 to change the position.

607
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Actually, I sang the song of love.

608
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Really?

609
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Yes.

610
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,240
Ok, ok, ok.

611
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,000
ilingual.

612
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,240
The game began.

613
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,520
We updated the technology next episode as for abandon

614
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,200
You can't play the具!

615
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,080
Very arrogant!

616
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,840
Lu Suama says

617
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,400
not a third seed tribes,

618
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,920
the Sun River might go down

619
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,760
Is there an end to this delaying relationship?

620
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Well, we are close for the next father who will be on his way

621
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,880
Very polite!

622
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,080
Liu gloves...

623
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,200
Zhejiang Notebook

624
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,080
Lu Menyuan

625
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,080
Liu replay, follow me

626
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,720
I will pay the charge

627
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,440
Now we are close

628
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
I will read the movements permanently.

629
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,280
You're tired.

630
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,040
Go away.

631
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,600
They will not come this time, right?

632
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I'm not afraid of you.

633
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Are you going to sleep?

634
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
I'll call you later.

635
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
What?

636
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
I said...

637
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
What's the matter?

638
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
I came to tell you

639
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
about the thing about Old Kai and Old Mao.

640
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
They left the game.

641
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
They left the game.

642
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
It's hard to tell.

643
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
What's the matter?

644
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Old Kai and Old Mao have been on the same page.

645
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
It's 11 o'clock.

646
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Old Mao is not going to the game.

647
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
11 o'clock?

648
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Do you want to sleep here tonight?

649
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Lu Si Cheng,

650
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm telling you the truth.

651
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
They've been talking about Old Mao

652
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
in the live broadcast room.

653
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Old Kai is directly on the live broadcast.

654
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
He looks so ugly.

655
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
So?

656
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
There's a training match with CQ tomorrow.

657
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
They quarreled like this.

658
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
How can we play tomorrow?

659
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
You're the captain.

660
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Don't you care?

661
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
You think too much.

662
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
The game was caught and it was a mess.

663
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
They're not kids.

664
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
It's good to have a little time.

665
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Do you remember what you said today?

666
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
What did I say?

667
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
If they lose tomorrow's training match,

668
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
don't be so mean.

669
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
I...

670
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Then you go to tell Old Kai and Old Mao later.

671
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
If they lose tomorrow's training match,

672
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
they can consider the game.

673
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
You tell me.

674
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
What does it matter to the person who takes the game?

675
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
You don't care about us.

676
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Do you want to use this way?

677
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
You go there yourself.

678
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
I won't wear this kind of dirty words.

679
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
What do you want me to say?

680
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
You want to use love education.

681
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
You want to have love.

682
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
They're not you.

683
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
You didn't give me love either.

684
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
If you hit me while I was playing ranked,

685
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
you hit me in the back.

686
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
You said I was so good at this game.

687
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Right? That's wrong too.

688
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
If you're like a cruel person,

689
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
pretending to be a bad guy,

690
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
and you're a loving person,

691
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
I'm going to suspect

692
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
whether you know the right meaning of love.

693
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Why should I know the right meaning of love?

694
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
I don't need to do this as a captain.

695
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I'll do it myself if you don't want to say it.

696
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
I'll do it myself.

697
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Luo Mo,

698
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
go back to your room and sleep.

699
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I'll sleep here.

700
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
You two,

701
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
can't we have a good talk?

702
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
We have nothing to talk about.

703
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
What a bad guy.

704
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I'll do it myself.

705
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
I'll do it myself.

706
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I'll do it myself.

707
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
It's over.

708
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
What do you mean?

709
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I can't go anywhere if I'm locked up.

710
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
The team only has 11.7% of the team.

711
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
You only have Yuan'er,

712
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
the one who caused the enemy's death.

713
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
You only have to help them get 2,000 points.

714
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
From 12 to 18 seconds,

715
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
you've played the game seven times.

716
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
You only played it once.

717
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
That time,

718
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
when the old man was not around,

719
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
that was the only time we won.

720
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Through the data of the two pillars of the Sixth Armored Team,

721
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
you're a dreamer in the normal game.

722
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Except the team and the murder data,

723
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
who will be in the team

724
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
after the team battle?

725
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
The two cats are here.

726
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Who is here?

727
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
But there's no data record.

728
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,600
It's all recorded by Lu Si Cheng.

729
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
It's a monster's brain.

730
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
It's really a team.

731
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
So anxious.

732
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I can't get out of the team battle.

733
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
My equipment is not good.

734
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
My house has too many enemies.

735
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
I can play in the mountain.

736
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
When the big snake was in the team battle,

737
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
the old man didn't look at it.

738
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
He went to the other side of the middle and the big man's face.

739
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
If you come to the body for the first time,

740
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
you'll be with the other side at the same time.

741
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
You also have enough time to talk to each other.

742
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
You can wait until K can recover the CD.

743
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Then you can kill him.

744
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
But what's the result?

745
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
You didn't come.

746
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
And K,

747
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
as a jungler at the critical moment,

748
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
why didn't you support him?

749
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
What are you thinking about?

750
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Three or four people are living on the other side.

751
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
I was sent to death in the past.

752
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Isn't there a monster here?

753
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Will he watch you die?

754
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
There's no point in winning the first game.

755
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I can accept it.

756
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
We lost to them in the spring game.

757
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
What did we say?

758
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
But if you don't want to play the game

759
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
or you have a big heart to play the game,

760
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
then I think you don't have to play it.

761
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
What are you doing?

762
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Don't worry.

763
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Talk to each other.

764
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Think about it.

765
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
You can protect them.

766
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
What's your name?

767
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Lu Yue changed his name.

768
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
I think I didn't say anything wrong.

769
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
You didn't say anything wrong?

770
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I changed my name to remind you

771
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
about the 3,000 family members in your back.

772
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Don't forget to...

773
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm asking you.

774
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I'm asking you.

775
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm asking you.

776
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm asking you.

777
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
I'm asking you.

778
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm asking you.

779
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
I'm asking you.

780
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I'm asking you.

781
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm asking you.

782
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I'm asking you.

783
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
All right.

784
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
I'm not making any trouble.

785
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
What do you think?

786
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
What's your name?

787
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Xia Wanjun.

788
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Jian Ni Chang.

789
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Rude.

790
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
You're so stupid.

791
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
I'm here to tell you the truth.

792
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
You made a mistake first.

793
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Don't let the two kids

794
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
who are against you

795
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
admit their mistakes

796
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
without asking them.

797
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
They will still continue to quarrel.

798
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
I just analyzed with you.

799
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
I want to be in love with them.

800
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
I'm afraid you'll be angry

801
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
with those who want to enter the game.

802
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
I've told you.

803
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
You have to be in love with your teammates.

804
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
You have to be in love with them.

805
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
If they still do this in the next game,

806
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
you really don't care?

807
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Don't worry.

808
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
They'll be fine next.

809
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
How do you know?

810
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Because I'm the captain.

811
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Only I'm OK.

812
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
They're OK.

813
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Give them time to adjust themselves.

814
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
The next key

815
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
and the next game

816
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
will be like this.

817
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
You'll see

818
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
what the captain is

819
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
in the heart of the criminal.

820
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
It's a lie.

821
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
He He.

822
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
You've solved your mess.

823
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Or else, you'll be scolded.

824
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
I didn't do anything.

825
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
When you analyzed with them just now,

826
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I saw your face

827
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
was still there.

828
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
I thought my man was really handsome.

829
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
I really want to kiss you.

830
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
You're late.

831
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Come on.

832
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I want to kiss you.

833
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Give them a mirror.

834
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
From now on,

835
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
the five words

836
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
for the blood

837
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
will have a very strong

838
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
and active image.

839
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Ke.

840
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Where's the plate?

841
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Are you hungry?

842
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Or do you want me to get you some food?

843
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Ke.

844
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
I'll get you some food.

845
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
I'll get you some food.

846
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Ke.

847
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Ke.

848
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Ke said he wanted to give you some food.

849
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Are you sure, Jia?

850
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Yes.

851
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Hurry up.

852
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Let's go.

853
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
I want to make you some food.

854
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Put some flour on it.

855
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Is it good?

856
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Ke.

857
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
What are you doing?

858
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm just going to help you.

859
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
I'm just going to help you.

860
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
I don't know who will help me.

861
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
I'll keep my promise when I get better.

862
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Keep your promise?

863
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
I won't keep my promise.

864
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Ke.

865
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Ke.

866
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Ke.

867
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Ke.

868
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Ke.

869
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Ke.

870
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Ke.

871
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Ke.

872
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Ke.

873
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Ke.

874
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Ke.

875
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Ke.

876
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Ke.

877
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Ke.

878
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Ke is here.

879
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Go help her lie down.

880
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
OK.

881
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I 알�me.

882
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
P國kTo help across to her.

883
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Come on.

884
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Me.

885
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
This game is over just for tonight.

886
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
This is great.

887
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Aren't the game over trivia?

888
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
You two are so good together.

889
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Done.

890
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,900
Not hungry,

891
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,900
hungry truck.

892
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Can't find food for a day.

893
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
If I'm hungry,

894
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,400
I'll get you some sweet andnew pork.

895
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
Let's go.

896
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,440
We can buy some wine and duck.

897
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,120
Okay, let's go.

898
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,080
Pongyang, are you going?

899
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
I'm not going. You two go.

900
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,320
Let's go.

901
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Silly girl.

902
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,080
You're so big, aren't you?

903
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm not.

904
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,240
Don't move.

905
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,800
Silly pig.

906
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,600
The education of love is complete.

907
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
Please accept it.

908
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,120
You two are texting the moms on businessмо?

909
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,100
Are the nodes of tokens

910
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,040
really not sticking to each other?

911
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,800
It's not even checked by thechlag.

912
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,840
It's really awesome.

913
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,600
Are you mad at me?

914
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,480
It's clear to say that

915
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,080
Luo Healthy is a loyal person,

916
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,440
is she very good at bluffing?

917
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,200
Not to let såmer

918
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,060

919
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,080

Wood Nova

923
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,160
Even you're a kid

924
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,960
there is no need to authorize the situation

925
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,160
to let you know that

926
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,320
she likes to be his moment.

927
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,520
If you don't want to talk about Nanjing,

928
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,320
I'll just send you to the ZGTN.

929
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
Don't talk about this again.

930
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,320
What are you doing?

931
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Nothing.

932
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Just those who sell our iron online.

933
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,320
Why didn't you knock on the door when you came in?

934
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,320
What's wrong with you?

935
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,920
I was kidnapped.

936
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,320
I was so generous.

937
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,920
Didn't you say you'd grow up together

938
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,320
and become stronger together?

939
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,120
Why is the glass wire broken?

940
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,920
I don't have a glass wire broken.

941
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,720
I was just thinking

942
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
that we lost the game with Alpha.

943
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,720
So the online scolding

944
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,120
is normal.

945
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,120
But I'm more worried about the game later.

946
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,520
If I lose,

947
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,320
I'll become the one in their mouths.

948
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,520
Huo Han.

949
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Nonsense.

950
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,920
Brother Cheng.

951
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,920
Don't you feel wronged?

952
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,520
Don't you feel regret?

953
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,920
No.

954
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
I never felt regret.

955
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
You've thought too much.

956
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,920
If we win the game,

957
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,920
people will feel uneasy.

958
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,520
But I don't want to lose.

959
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Even if I win the game, I don't want to lose.

960
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
And they're all strong

961
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,720
in the back.

962
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Yes.

963
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
That's why we have to adjust our mentality.

964
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,120
It's not good to stay in a bad state.

965
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
It might cause our game.

966
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
But this is not the reason.

967
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
And

968
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,120
we should lose the game

969
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,920
before the game.

970
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,520
Because we can't lose

971
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,120
at that stage.

972
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Brother Cheng.

973
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Do you think I'm a bad guy?

974
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,520
Should I lean on you?

975
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,680
Tomorrow, how do we continue the game?

976
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
I know.

977
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,720
Don't worry.

978
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,920
We won't lose.

979
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,500
Told me you didn't hear me.

980
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,720
But after you towers,

981
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,360
Maybe the double no.es far higher with just a single repetition.

982
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,880
He's right.

983
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,440
Are you happy now?

984
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,660
Yes, it's so rush.

985
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,620
I'm going to facetill my cell phone's at noon.

986
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,560
Hey.

987
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,040
to save our team's reputation.

988
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,840
Live broadcast?

989
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
You must participate.

990
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,400
It's a good idea.

991
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,800
No.

992
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,680
No way.

993
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,080
The sponsor of this show

994
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,400
is our club's partner.

995
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,360
Brother Cheng, you have to cooperate with this.

996
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Otherwise, I'm afraid that Mr. Wang will come to talk to you.

997
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,800
Everyone, please follow up.

998
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,200
Now is the critical time of the entertainment debate.

999
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,600
The bad news on the Internet

1000
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,360
must be kept calm and calm.

1001
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,600
Rui Zhi, who are you talking about?

1002
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,640
Don't be too excited.

1003
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,720
Remember,

1004
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,240
the laugh of the pissing.

1005
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,920
Brother Cheng, can we start?

1006
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,480
Brother Cheng, thank you for

1007
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,640
taking the time to

1008
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,720
come to our interview during the battle.

1009
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,120
I'm also one of the fans of ZJDX.

1010
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,040
So today we also chose

1011
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,840
the fans of the team

1012
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,800
who are on the Internet.

1013
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,400
I want to hear your opinion.

1014
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,240
Please say it.

1015
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,200
Recently, the battle against Alpha has been lost.

1016
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,720
Did it bring a big impact to the team?

1017
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,480
Some people say that the old cat and old cat

1018
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,400
have broken their relationship.

1019
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,920
Some even called out

1020
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,160
the slogan of ZJDX

1021
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,480
about to fall.

1022
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,560
I don't know how you see it.

1023
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,720
That match with Alpha

1024
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,400
indeed has a problem

1025
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,600
with the old cat and old cat.

1026
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,440
But it's just a match.

1027
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,320
As the captain,

1028
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,440
the point of interest is how to fix it.

1029
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
We haven't done enough.

1030
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,520
Instead, it's not the

1031
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,200
point of the captain to fix it.

1032
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,120
Can you talk about

1033
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,120
the reason for this loss?

1034
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,640
The reason for loss?

1035
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,760
Because there are many fans who say

1036
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,160
although it's from the surface,

1037
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,520
it's the match between the old cat and the old cat.

1038
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,360
But

1039
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,040
since the time of the famous god ZJDX,

1040
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,160
the relationship has been very harmonious.

1041
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,360
It has never happened before.

1042
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,040
So the reason for the loss of the team

1043
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,960
is because of the relationship

1044
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,360
with the love of the team?

1045
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,640
Will the relationship

1046
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,360
be affected

1047
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,680
because of the relationship between you and Tong Yao?

1048
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,920
First of all,

1049
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,720
although Tong Yao is my teammate,

1050
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,720
our relationship is our private matter.

1051
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,400
It has nothing to do with the team.

1052
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,640
Secondly,

1053
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,120
the questions we have about the team

1054
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
are because I have a conflict

1055
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,520
with Tong Yao.

1056
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
I have only one answer.

1057
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,920
If all of this

1058
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,160
is because of your own guess,

1059
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,800
it will be a series of ZJDX

1060
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,040
that will fall.

1061
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,520
Now close our game video.

1062
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,600
Remove the game ticket,

1063
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,720
tear our signature,

1064
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,880
and burn our photos.

1065
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,080
If you have any,

1066
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,760
please cancel the live broadcast.

1067
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,920
Brother Cheng,

1068
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,000
are you not afraid of getting hurt

1069
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,760
and supporting your fans?

1070
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,680
I am very grateful

1071
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,200
for your support and love.

1072
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,400
But I don't regret leaving you.

1073
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,840
Don't tell me in private.

1074
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,560
I won't.

1075
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,960
Even if I see it, I won't regret it.

1076
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,680
Good morning.

1077
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,400
Good morning.

1078
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,240
Brother Cheng,

1079
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,200
don't you think you should

1080
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,000
apologize to your fans for this?

1081
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,240
What is the reason for my apology?

1082
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,960
If ZJDX

1083
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,200
was voted by the World Cup

1084
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,360
of the double C,

1085
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,160
I would apologize.

1086
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,840
But I won't.

1087
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,240
Because of ZJDX,

1088
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,000
we just failed

1089
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,040
in the game.

1090
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,360
If we fail this time,

1091
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,760
and you get a big kill,

1092
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,560
and you get a big kill,

1093
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,960
I will ask you.

1094
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,520
Is this your support for ZJDX?

1095
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,760
I am very disappointed.

1096
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,960
I am also very sad.

1097
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,640
I even have to apologize to myself.

1098
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,000
How could I have

1099
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,920
such a strong fan

1100
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,960
who is a man and a woman?

1101
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,840
And those

1102
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,160
who are on the street.

1103
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,880
I ask you to tell me

1104
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,880
ZJDX

1105
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,280
and the same life attack.

1106
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
You should remember one thing.

1107
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,760
The Internet is not a legal place.

1108
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,800
You are so weak.

1109
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,800
Maybe in the future,

1110
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,520
you will pay for this

1111
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,200
more than you think.

1112
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,560
I will say one last thing.

1113
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,720
Don't think I think so well.

1114
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,320
I am not.

1115
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,960
I am not.

1116
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,960
I can't eat.

1117
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,480
Dianjing,

1118
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,000
our Zhong Dan,

1119
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
is waiting for me.

1120
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,240
I am sure.

1121
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,620
Then can we

1122
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,920
ask through your problem meal?

1123
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,600
You can ask your boss

1124
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,360
and you will get a bigฉ plain,

1125
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,920
I guess.

1126
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,800
You are so smart.

1127
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,440
You can explain to me,

1128
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,360
how dare I anti-aging?

1129
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,480
You are so foolish.

1130
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,680
How could

1131
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,760
you will not do this to my girl's wife

1132
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,960
if the review on 갈아icket was cancelled?

1133
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
Have a look at this.

1134
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,760
It's impossible.

1135
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,000
It's too late.

1136
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,800
It's too late.

1137
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,200
It's too late.

1138
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,680
It's too late.

1139
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,160
It's too late.

1140
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,800
It's too late.

1141
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,480
It's too late.

1142
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:35,600
It's too late.

1143
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:35,840
It's too late.

1144
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,480
It's too late.

1145
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,080
It's too late.

1146
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,240
These pre-release projects

1147
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,880
can be uploaded online.

1148
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,960
You can really get the real-time file.

1149
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
I'll be fine in a few days.

1150
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,520
Such a big deal.

1151
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,640
What's going on?

1152
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,320
Now the ZGDX is in the public opinion.

1153
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,640
Why are you so negative?

1154
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Yes.

1155
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,640
First, we should let the two Cs practice.

1156
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,360
Then we can't even have a chance

1157
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,400
to win the game.

1158
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,720
Do you know how many fans

1159
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,400
have left our orders

1160
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,120
because of their favorite players?

1161
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,680
You're making a fool of us.

1162
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,520
Yes.

1163
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,160
Lu Si Cheng is the captain of ZGDX.

1164
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,920
He's not only responsible for the business of the team,

1165
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,960
but also

1166
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,080
doesn't respect our sponsor.

1167
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,160
Why is it so hard now?

1168
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,720
Last time,

1169
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,760
you guys made a statement that

1170
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,360
the players' personal opinion

1171
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,240
will be separated from the game.

1172
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,160
But now,

1173
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,200
the private matter has affected the public opinion.

1174
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,520
Who should be responsible?

1175
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Who can be responsible?

1176
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,240
Yao Yao, what's going on?

1177
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
Why are the people on the Internet

1178
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,440
so cruel?

1179
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,360
From the beginning to the end,

1180
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,160
when did you feel such a tragedy?

1181
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,800
Are you okay?

1182
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,080
Mom, I'm fine.

1183
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,400
I'm not afraid of

1184
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,120
the players' personal opinion.

1185
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,520
Don't worry.

1186
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,480
I'll continue my training.

1187
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,840
There's a game tomorrow.

1188
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,600
I've reminded you.

1189
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,520
It's hard to leave this path.

1190
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,360
I know.

1191
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,120
I know the attitude of the club.

1192
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,080
If the team can't stay,

1193
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,920
you can come home to inherit the family business.

1194
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,760
You're still kidding me

1195
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,960
at this time.

1196
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,080
No one is kidding you here.

1197
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,520
Just stop this.

1198
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,920
I'll keep going this path.

1199
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,360
Chessman,

1200
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,040
can you really do nothing but work hard?

1201
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,120
