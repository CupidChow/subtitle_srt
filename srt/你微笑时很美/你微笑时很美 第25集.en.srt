1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,760
Do you want to give it a try?

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,450
Try what?

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,820
Me.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,760
Cheng, do you want it too?

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,160
I already have someone I like.

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,770
What?

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,060
You're coming to Shenzhen?

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,910
What for?

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,110
Don't scare her.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,720
Five million.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,240
Leave my son.

[Episode 25]

14
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,430
That's it.

15
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,210
You may leave now.

16
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:56,880
Okay.

17
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,570
Okay. Okay.

18
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,900
Come on, Mr. Li.

19
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,870
You two, wait a minute.

20
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,030
Sit down.

21
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,150
There are no outsiders here now.

22
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,060
You're in a relationship,

23
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,840
and I had to find that out on the internet.

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,700
Do you think that's appropriate?

25
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,630
Mom.

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,550
I've told you many times.

27
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,579
You don't have to come over.

28
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,980
I don't have to come over?

29
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,510
If I hadn't come,

30
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,970
were you planning to make all the important decisions in your life

31
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,380
on your own?

32
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,810
You didn't even ask me or your dad.

33
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,290
I've been an adult for a long time.

34
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,240
So what?

35
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,300
You're still my son even if you're an adult.

36
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,620
Besides,

37
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,260
I can't even come visit just because you're dating someone?

38
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,660
Tong Yao?

39
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,110
Do you think it's appropriate for him to do this?

40
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,670
Mom,

41
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,580
I like her.

42
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,850
No one can change this.

43
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,790
Yes.

44
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,190
Who you like

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,630
and whom you want to be with

46
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,230
is indeed your own business.

47
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,380
No need to ask for our opinions.

48
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,750
However,

49
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,240
based on what I saw on the internet,

50
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,760
the road ahead for the two of you

51
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,840
will be bound to be bumpy.

52
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,410
Mom, don't worry.

53
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,829
Whatever comes our way...

54
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,750
we'll face it together.

ZGDX announcement.

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,660
ZGDX Esports Club members

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,030
Lu Sicheng and Tong Yao

58
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,630
are currently in a relationship.

59
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,190
Thank you for your continued support and attention

60
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,830
towards the two players and Team ZGDX.

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,550
The club maintains an open management philosophy...

62
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,220
When did they get together?

63
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,630
And minimizes interference

64
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,510
in members' personal relationships,

65
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,700
as long as it does not affect team training

66
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,850
and match results.

67
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,860
Regarding their relationship,

68
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,260
all members of the club

69
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,089
have sent their best wishes.

70
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,350
Regarding any online comments

71
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,830
that defame Lu Sicheng and Tong Yao,

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,940
the club will continue to monitor

73
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,390
and reserves the right to pursue legal action

74
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,990
against those who publish or repost such infringing statements.

75
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,550
Regarding comments

76
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,390
that potentially threaten their personal safety,

77
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,070
the club will take

78
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,180
all necessary legal measures

79
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,790
to hold the perpetrators accountable.

80
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,190
We will not condone this.

81
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,390
Once again, we thank the media and fans

82
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,230
for their ongoing care, understanding, and support.

83
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,830
On behalf of Mr. Lu Sicheng

84
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,790
and Ms. Tong Yao,

85
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,030
we sincerely apologize

86
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,470
for the waste of social resources

87
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,150
caused by personal emotional issues.

88
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,430
We also call on everyone to work together

89
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,630
to create a better online environment.

90
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,060
Honestly,

91
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,310
the official blog manager is really tough.

92
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,760
They're just one step away from wishing you both a lifetime of happiness

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,960
and lots of children.

94
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,170
You two.

95
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,700
Weren't you going to quit sugar?

96
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,730
No, I'm just annoyed.

97
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,830
Annoyed about what?

98
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,400
I made a mistake.

99
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,140
I'm afraid this time I was too impulsive

100
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,930
and didn't consider the consequences.

101
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,550
What consequences?

102
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,510
About...

103
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,280
things you have to face.

104
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,110
If you're afraid

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,990
that I might be defeated by those online comments,

106
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,710
don't worry.

107
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,590
I'm fine.

108
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,600
Actually, at first, I was a little scared.

109
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,500
I thought that once it was made public,

110
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,600
there would be a lot of opposing and questioning voices.

111
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,390
So I had a lot of concerns.

112
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,480
What I was more afraid of was that it would affect you.

113
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,890
Just like what happened with Jian Yang and me.

114
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,310
We'd start to regret being together.

115
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,910
Then came lies, deceit,

116
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,280
and, eventually, drifting apart.

117
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,110
But later...

118
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,510
What happened later?

119
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,510
Later, I realized

120
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,910
you're different from Jian Yang.

121
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,190
So none of these things would happen.

122
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,320
That was when I felt at ease.

123
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,110
I've also prepared myself

124
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,590
to face all the storms that come our way.

125
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,190
I don't regret it,

126
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,790
and I'm not afraid.

127
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,550
You're so strong.

128
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,150
I have to be as strong as you.

129
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,920
Shorty has grown up.

130
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,770
I thought you would be so scared

131
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,430
you'd curl up under the covers and cry all night.

132
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,330
Still such a long way to go?

133
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,510
Gosh.

134
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,760
I didn't expect to be shown off by your love

135
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,230
while taking a car ride.

136
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,640
Look at them being all lovey-dovey

137
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,270
while you and I are just here as the third wheel.

138
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,830
Captain,

139
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,950
well,

140
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,500
Tong Yao is livestreaming.

141
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,090
Do you want to watch it?

142
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,600
Livestreaming at a time like this,

143
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,750
she really doesn't care about her life.

144
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,230
I don't know if Tong Yao doesn't care about her life,

145
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,360
but I think you don't care about yours.

146
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,870
Right now, I just want to focus on esports.

147
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,370
She's really live streaming.

148
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,500
Warning: Incoming wave of trolls.

149
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,110
You actually have the nerve to stream?

150
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,590
Are you here to ride on the wave of popularity,

151
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,770
using your recent trending topics to gain attention?

152
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,470
How interesting.

153
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,040
Hello, Mrs. Lu.

154
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,550
I'm live streaming.

155
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm training for ranked matches.

156
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,350
If I don't stream now to meet my quota,

157
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,390
when will I?

158
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,360
How can I be shameless when I do a live stream?

159
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,090
I used to do live streaming too.

160
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,080
If I don't do it today,

161
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,090
I won't have enough time to live stream gaming by the end of the month.

162
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,470
By then, I can only livestream sleeping for you guys.

163
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,470
Sleep with Lu Sicheng?

164
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,789
Low-class streamer, I'm calling the cops.

165
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,919
Tell us about Cheng.

166
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,590
About what?

167
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,840
Cheng is indeed a great AD.

168
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,710
He's in the top three in the world now.

169
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,470
This AD is probably sleeping right now.

170
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,260
After all, earlier this morning,

171
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,850
he had to hold my hand in front of his mom and forced me

172
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,050
to swear to walk together in the future.

173
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,050
Sorry, I showed off affection again.

174
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,100
Sorry.

175
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,830
Are you provoking us?

176
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,630
Showing off your relationship?

177
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,190
It's really enough.

178
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,150
Cheng is only in the top three?

179
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,300
Yes, the top three.

180
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,570
I can't say he's number one, right?

181
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,230
After all, there's another AD nearby

182
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,090
who is about the same level as him.

183
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,010
OP missed the point entirely.

184
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,840
When will you break up?

185
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,740
Break up?

186
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,980
I got myself a boyfriend through my own efforts.

187
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,180
Why should I break up?

188
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,630
You're in a relationship now, and you've become weak.

189
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,510
You used to rarely get solo-killed in the game.

190
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,830
Waiting for ZGDX to be crushed.

191
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,830
You're not suited to play Aoandon.

192
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,290
I also think I'm not good at playing Aoandon.

193
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,650
But I've seen all Koreans are so cracked with her.

194
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,310
That's why I need to practice.

195
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,740
Otherwise, I'd get destroyed at the World Championships.

196
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,860
If I master one more shikigami,

197
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,390
that's one fewer ban we have to waste.

198
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,350
Isn't that good?

199
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,560
Where's Cheng? Has he woken up?

200
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,970
Ask him to do the live stream.

201
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,700
Our captain should be up by now.

202
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,110
Our captain, our.

203
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,240
More public displays of affection. Unsubscribe.

204
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,760
Cheng is here!

205
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,450
What's my ranking as the ADC?

206
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,750
Childish.

207
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
You're not childish.

208
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,190
You played the Aoandon with a score of 1 kill, 6 deaths, and 5 assists.

209
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,650
If you dare to play it in the match, I'll blow your head off.

210
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,290
I'm practicing.

211
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:29,990
Go away.

212
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,780
I saw Tai play Aoandon.

213
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,150
You're not supposed to play it like that.

214
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,120
Come on, let me show you.

215
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,950
You're an AD.

216
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,950
How can you teach me to play mid lane?

217
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,060
Let me try it.

218
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,860
Don't shake.

219
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,270
Now the mid-lane minion wave is in the tower.

220
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,950
Don't go in yet.

221
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,160
It's because you're too scared to go in

222
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,570
that the enemy mid laner, Kiyohime,

223
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,790
keeps stomping you.

224
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,260
Did they know that we swapped players?

225
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,220
Watch out. Watch out.

226
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,750
Quiet. I won't play for you if you keep this up.

227
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,610
Alright. Go away.

228
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,310
Go away. Go away.

229
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,070
No.

230
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,690
I'm live streaming.

231
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,630
I know.

232
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,500
Now that's just flaunting your affection.

233
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,790
Next week, you'll be facing Alpha.

234
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,710
Let's see whether you're the real deal or just bluster.

235
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,240
Wait for you to get crushed.

236
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,480
The strength of a veteran powerhouse like Alpha

237
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,670
is indeed not to be underestimated.

238
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,990
They've managed to make ZGDX,

239
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,020
which had been cruising smoothly through the National League,

240
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,230
lose their opening game.

241
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,710
In the previous match,

242
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,150
ZGDX's Cat and K

243
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,470
didn't cooperate well at all,

244
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,090
as if it were their first time playing together.

245
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,710
In the last match, Cat almost got targeted and killed repeatedly

246
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,260
while K was busy in the jungle, turning a blind eye.

247
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,720
Today, ZGDX's top laner and jungle seem like

248
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,830
they never want to see each other again.

249
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,570
That's right.

250
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,300
We don't know if it's because of the external factors.

251
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,210
We're in a good state today. Stay steady and play well.

252
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,140
We must win.

253
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,270
The score is 0 to 1.

254
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,590
ZGDX's performance

255
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,340
still looks weak in this match.

256
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,870
Team Alpha

257
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,470
is a famous strong-team tester.

258
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,350
We'll see

259
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,190
whether ZGDX is truly strong

260
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,360
or just got lucky with an easy run so far

261
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,030
once this match is over.

262
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,000
Team ZGDX may have once been strong.

263
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,210
Now their dual carries are both distracted by their relationships.

264
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,550
How can they focus on the game?

265
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,430
Exactly.

266
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,510
Diving the tower. Diving the tower!

267
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,640
Here they come. Here they come. Go. Go.

268
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,310
Look, the match has just started,

269
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,960
and Cat has already died twice.

270
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,260
Two heads in a row.

271
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,670
Nice. Well done.

272
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,270
The enemy mid laner and jungler are consistently targeting Cat.

273
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,130
Pang, we bot laners focus on farming.

274
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,770
Okay.

275
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,950
Their top lane is an easy target.

276
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,080
Good, good. Come on.

277
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,980
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

278
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,440
Alpha's Aoandon and Ibaraki Doji

279
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,340
seem to be preparing to cut off Cat's

280
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,530
retreat path back to his tower.

281
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,230
The bottom duo is also heading over.

282
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,470
K is still in the bottom jungle.

283
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,270
He was going to join in,

284
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,510
but after seeing the enemy had four players there

285
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,750
and that Cat was almost dead,

286
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,320
he turned around and continued farming.

287
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,880
Oh no, Cat is dead again.

288
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,430
Four people ganked him.

289
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,390
He had no help. The top lane is falling apart.

290
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,120
They could play mahjong there! Where were my teammates?

291
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,310
K came halfway and then ran away.

292
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,410
By the time he entered,

293
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,270
it was just giving away another kill.

294
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,130
It's meaningless.

295
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,510
Hurry up and finish this game. It's a lost cause.

296
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,650
If we stall a bit, we may still have a chance.

297
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,530
Cat, just farm.

298
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,570
Don't fight them.

299
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,200
You can come to my lane for the minion waves.

300
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,150
I'll go check the jungle for some resources.

301
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,310
Give him the minion waves,

302
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,620
and then you farm my jungle camps.

303
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,440
Playing nice while taking all the advantages for yourself.

304
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,230
What's wrong with Cheng having your jungle camps?

305
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,400
You've been farming since the game started, and you're still not done?

306
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,720
Now you're blaming me for not ganking, huh?

307
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,790
It's useless for me to help you with all four of them.

308
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,710
When two players came,

309
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,110
I was in the bot lane. I couldn't make it, and you saw it.

310
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,430
They even abandoned the camps and Kirin

311
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,390
just to gank you.

312
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,560
What can I do?

313
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,070
And your coins

314
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,470
should've been made up in other lanes by now, right?

315
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,630
If you don't believe me, check the real-time economy chart

316
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
after the game.

317
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,670
Shut up.

318
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,370
Do you want to just AFK and let the enemy push mid?

319
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,370
Small team fight.

320
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,180
Coming.

321
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,850
Copy that.

322
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,670
Smiling suddenly jumped out of the grass

323
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,860
and quickly took down the enemy mid laner.

324
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,460
CC them. Unleashing. Go, go.

325
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,510
Let's recall. The mid laners retreat. We'll tank.

326
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,830
Since this game,

327
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,150
with ZGDX's top laner being targeted too many times in the early stage,

328
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,270
it seems like they're looking for another way to break through.

329
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,190
But look, K

330
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,320
is still farming in the bottom jungle.

331
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,000
Look, Cat is here!

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,750
I guess he's probably thinking of

333
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,790
taking the opportunity to get revenge

334
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,910
with Lu Sicheng around.

335
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,350
-On us mid laners.
-Coming, coming.

336
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,590
Mid laners, should we retreat?

337
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,270
This tower's going down.

338
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,670
Retreat, retreat. Leave it, leave it.

339
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,580
They're pulling back.

340
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,550
Cat, stop their ADC.

341
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,880
We must push this tower.

342
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,710
Stop attacking. Protect the AD.

343
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,550
Meanwhile, Smiling flashes in,

344
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,880
and with one skill, takes out the enemy AD!

345
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,080
Retreat. Retreat.

346
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,840
Judging by this round, in the past,

347
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,730
K and Cat used to always appear together.

348
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,930
But without K today,

349
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,540
Cat is still fierce.

350
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,910
Steady. Steady.

351
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,370
Steady.

352
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,140
I have skills.

353
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,030
They have two players, yet they still failed to protect the Dodomeki.

354
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,710
Cat had to tank all the damage.

355
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,470
But at least Smiling

356
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,040
managed to get some payback for him just now.

357
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,310
We're catching up in gold now.

358
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,840
Let's split-push the lanes

359
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,190
and regroup for Orochi later.

360
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,830
Okay.

361
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,430
Attention, they've all split up to push lanes.

362
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,500
Protect the wave. Protect the wave. Clear the minions.

363
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,450
Protect the tower.

364
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,590
Qiu, have you noticed?

365
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,230
If the previous team fight happened

366
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,150
because K was stealing the tower in the bottom lane,

367
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,550
then now, after everyone's split up to farm,

368
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,070
K and Cat, the good buddies,

369
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,190
are still going their separate lanes.

370
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,710
You're right.

371
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,410
ZGDX's dual carries are in a relationship,

372
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,320
but today, the top laner and jungler are having a bit of fallout.

373
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,450
Cat, hold off the Karasu Tengu.

374
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,390
We're doing the Orochi.

375
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:42,990
Okay.

376
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,310
As expected, the four of ZGDX

377
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,470
are now by the river at the mid lane.

378
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,550
If Cat can hold off the enemy Karasu Tengu smoothly

379
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,630
in the bottom lane,

380
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,950
the Orochi will definitely be theirs.

381
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,630
That's right.

382
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,760
Hold them off. Wait for me. I'm coming.

383
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,740
Karasu Tengu got rid of Cat's interference

384
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,440
and quickly used Shift to move toward the mid lane to help.

385
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,770
Assemble! Assemble!

386
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,830
Why is Cat still down at the bottom tower?

387
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,590
But Karasu Tengu came back after just finishing recovering.

388
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,120
Is ZGDX going to fight 4v5?

389
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,830
Let's fight. Let's fight.

390
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,360
Watch out, they're coming.

391
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,900
Cat, come and join the team fight.

392
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,560
K, find a spot and wait for Cat.

393
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,260
Cat is still in the bottom lane.

394
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,320
ZGDX has already started the Orochi.

395
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,550
Team Alpha's five players are coming.

396
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,350
Go, go, go.

397
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,910
We can do it. We can take them.

398
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,640
ZGDX is facing a 4v5 situation.

399
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,140
ZGDX's lineup has been disrupted.

400
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,510
Kill him.

401
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,310
Good. Good.

402
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,430
Be careful with the jungler. Be careful with the jungler.

403
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,590
Chessman is

404
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,710
in a relatively safe position,

405
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,890
but his teammates are starting to crumble.

406
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,720
Pang is down!

407
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,230
Alpha's support arrived too fast.

408
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,290
I'm just a support. I can't tank this.

409
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,990
Cat is still split-pushing in the bottom lane.

410
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,870
Karasu Tengu uses a jump-split and knocks up three members of ZGDX.

411
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,290
Now both of the dual carries have been killed.

412
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,600
They're definitely going to lose the Orochi.

413
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,750
Cat is still pushing the lane,

414
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,790
while K can only watch from the brush

415
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,630
as the Orochi gets taken.

416
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,230
Hurry up and finish the Orochi.

417
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,270
Watch out for enemy Kosodenote and Mujou.

418
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,530
Mujou might use Shift.

419
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,830
Alpha is about to start the Orochi!

420
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,950
They're taking the Orochi now!

421
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,110
K has no way to stop them

422
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,430
and can only try to ambush them from the bush.

423
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,840
K dives in to steal the Orochi!

424
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,510
Can he manage to steal it?

425
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,870
K is instantly killed!

426
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,270
He was killed instantly!

427
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,970
What's wrong with you?

428
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,450
You can't even hold off one Karasu Tengu.

429
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,910
Can't you see my equipment?

430
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,270
You can't steal the Orochi, and you're blaming me?

431
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,170
Who else should I blame?

432
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,950
Karasu Tengu can use Shift. Why can't you?

433
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,890
Can't you see my HP? Come and give them a kill?

434
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,490
Stop arguing.

435
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,640
Come on. Let's continue to defend.

436
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,260
Watch the base.

437
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,790
Look over here.

438
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,750
Cat has pushed the minion wave to the high ground.

439
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,109
But Alpha reacted quickly too

440
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,310
and recalled to defend their high ground tower.

441
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,599
Back to the high ground!

442
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,660
Defense! Defense!

443
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,869
Kuro Mujou tried to backdoor but couldn't push the minion wave,

444
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,390
so he had to retreat.

445
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,190
Here, ZGDX's top laner has been struggling.

446
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,850
He's given up too many deaths early on.

447
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,110
Let's check the stats.

448
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,670
He has only two assists,

449
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,150
and his economy is significantly behind.

450
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,550
And now the Orochi's lost.

451
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,640
If ZGDX doesn't change its strategy,

452
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,710
it's going to be difficult going forward.

453
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,510
Alpha will definitely

454
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,590
take advantage of the situation to push the high ground now.

455
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,270
After several team fights in this match,

456
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,230
I feel ZGDX

457
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,470
seems to have lost its coordination.

458
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:47,660
Yes.

459
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,540
The players' mentality may be starting to break down.

460
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:49,750
Yes.

461
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,470
If Alpha forces another team fight at this moment,

462
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,400
their chances of winning are high.

463
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,330
And here it comes—here it comes!

464
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,780
K tries to flank the backline of Alpha!

465
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,190
But he gets caught and controlled!

466
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,590
Cat is in! Cat is in!

467
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,230
What's the point of coming in now?

468
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,270
K is already dead now!

469
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,720
Now it's just Cat 1v5.

470
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,870
K has died, and he came.

471
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,060
It's too late!

472
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,470
Yes.

473
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,530
Retreat, retreat.

474
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,110
Alpha is pushing in!

475
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,150
This could be the final push!

476
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,470
Can Smiling and the others hold them off?

477
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,550
Come on. Control him!

478
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:15,960
Stay steady! Stay steady!

479
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,830
No frontline, no frontline!

480
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:19,590
Clear the minions.

481
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,750
They're completely exposed

482
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,830
to the enemy's attacks.

483
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,870
Clear the minion wave. Clear the minion wave!

484
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,590
I'll tank. I'll tank.

485
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,510
It's still because of the internal conflict between Cat and his good buddy, K.

486
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,460
They didn't cooperate at all today.

487
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,550
Chessman and Smiling have recovered their health,

488
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,830
but Cat has already sacrificed. There is no frontline.

489
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,790
Alpha's Dodomeki is relentlessly attacking the base.

490
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,750
At this point in the game,

491
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,150
ZGDX is struggling

492
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,430
because they lost the top lane.

493
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,900
Alpha! Alpha is coming in!

494
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,510
Alpha is unstoppable,

495
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,570
and they're attacking the base hard!

496
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,390
They took down the base!

497
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,360
With the sound of the base exploding,

498
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,780
ZGDX takes their first loss

499
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,870
in the National League.

500
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,160
Congratulations to Team Alpha for winning this match!

501
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,110
Congratulations to Team Alpha.

502
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,590
After this match,

503
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,110
this reminds me

504
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,010
of the recent criticisms

505
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,150
of ZGDX.

506
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,150
You mean

507
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,100
that ZGDX is losing its fighting ability

508
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,760
because of their dual carries' relationship,

509
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,400
and the whole club may be caught in a crisis?

510
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,220
What's wrong?

511
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,340
I thought about that comment, "Get crushed."

512
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,240
You're back.

513
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,550
You guys are in bad shape today.

514
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,110
It's normal to lose

515
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,690
to Alpha, an old powerhouse. It's okay.

516
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,380
Cheer up.

517
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,430
Yeah.

518
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,780
Next Sunday's match against FNATIC is the real challenge.

519
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,260
Let's learn from this loss and get better.

520
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,460
And YQCB, it's also a tough opponent.

521
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,460
That team is really strong.

522
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,930
Ever since Pope joined,

523
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,770
the style of the whole team has changed.

524
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,210
He's like a catalyst.

525
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,240
Even their leader, the support,

526
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,730
once the God of Support during the qualifiers,

527
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,670
has become more aggressive and bold.

528
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,510
If they catch you off guard,

529
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,870
it's really hard to turn things around.

530
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,400
If we don't want to lose the next match,

531
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,950
it all comes down to whether our jungler

532
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,170
can handle the top lane's struggles.

533
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,300
It also depends on

534
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,310
whether the top laner will still play wildly

535
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,840
when his economy is behind.

536
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,500
With your attitudes,

537
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,480
it wouldn't be impossible to lose another match.

538
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Oh my God.

539
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,790
God K's gaze is terrifying.

540
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
I'm scared.

541
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,790
What are you scared of?

542
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,330
Shoot.

543
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,070
Our top laner and jungler have fallen out.

544
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,190
What?

545
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,960
Cat and K.

546
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,220
They're throwing childish tantrums.

547
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,620
They need someone to give them a good whip to make them behave.

548
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,870
Actually, I advocate for an education based on love.

549
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,430
Really?

550
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,680
K has just changed the name of his live stream room,

551
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,910
which had remained the same for years.

552
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,830
The name was

553
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,210
"Dropping points with Queen Cat in duo."

554
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,510
Seriously?

555
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,780
When will their dramatic, falling-out show be over?

556
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,100
There's about to be a new queen.

557
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,670
Pick me! Pick me!

558
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,010
Pick me! Pick me!

559
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Is this guy not in the training base?

560
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,120
These fans really know how to stir things up.

561
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,510
They're really trying to drive God K crazy,

562
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,270
huh?

563
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,250
It's like they want chaos everywhere.

564
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,100
LOL?

565
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,480
The songstress knows not the grief of the captive king;

566
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,340
By riverside, she sings his song of Parting Spring.

567
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,220
I'm tired. I'm done.

568
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,870
Are they serious this time?

569
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,430
Are you going to sleep?

570
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,390
Then I'll call you later.

571
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:53,980
What?

572
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,500
I said...

573
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,150
Is there something you need to talk to me about?

574
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,750
I'm here to tell you about K and Cat.

575
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,170
When they left

576
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,470
the arena...

577
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,910
their faces were all dark.

578
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,310
Go on.

579
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,450
K won't even queue with Cat anymore.

580
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,170
And now it's already 11 PM.

581
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,910
No one knows where Cat has gone.

582
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,950
It's 11 PM now?

583
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,880
Do you want to sleep here tonight?

584
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,460
Lu Sicheng, I'm talking about serious stuff with you.

585
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,140
The fans kept talking about Cat

586
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,380
in the live streaming room.

587
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,440
K turned off the live stream and left.

588
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,790
His face was super ugly.

589
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,310
So?

590
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,700
We still have a practice match against CK tomorrow.

591
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,900
How can they play tomorrow if they fight like this?

592
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,830
You're the captain. Aren't you going to take care of this?

593
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,970
You're thinking too much.

594
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,750
It's frustrating when you get targeted during a match.

595
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,870
They're not kids.

596
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,510
They'll get over it in a while.

597
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,310
Remember what you said today.

598
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,250
What did I say?

599
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,340
If we lose tomorrow's practice match

600
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,590
because of them,

601
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,200
don't say a word to me about it.

602
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,650
I...

603
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,510
Then you go tell K and Cat

604
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,750
that if we lose tomorrow's practice match,

605
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,830
they may need to consider being benched.

606
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,160
Tell them that I said it.

607
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,700
Using bench time as a threat, what kind of leadership style is that?

608
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,140
You either don't deal with it

609
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,070
or if you do, must you do it this way?

610
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,640
You can go tell them that yourself if you want to.

611
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,980
I'm not going to pass on such annoying words.

612
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,510
Then what do you want me to say?

613
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,070
Use a loving approach and show some care.

614
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,470
They're not like you.

615
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,000
You've never shown me any love either.

616
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,640
If that's what you consider love—

617
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,000
while I was playing ranked,

618
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,760
you were behind me nitpicking

619
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,220
everything I did wrong, criticizing my positioning,

620
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,480
my builds, and everything else—

621
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,790
then I really have to question

622
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,590
whether you truly understand

623
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,310
what what love really means.

624
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,390
Why should I need to know

625
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,720
what love really means?

626
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,410
I don't need to do this as the captain.

627
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,430
If you don't want to say it, I'll say it myself.

628
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,760
Cat.

629
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,150
Go back to your room and sleep.

630
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,350
I'm sleeping here.

631
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,190
Do you guys have to be like this?

632
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,420
Can't you just talk it out?

633
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,410
I have nothing to say to him.

634
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,580
You're really driving me crazy.

635
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,030
Explain it.

636
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,020
I... Explain what?

637
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,430
I was stuck in the top lane.

638
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,760
I couldn't go anywhere.

639
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,550
Besides, I made up for the gold deficit

640
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,350
from other lanes in the top lane.

641
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,010
Look at the real-time economy chart if you don't believe me.

642
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,010
In the first 20 minutes of the match,

643
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,310
as the top laner,

644
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,640
your participation in team fights was only 11.7%.

645
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,390
The damage you dealt to the enemy shikigami

646
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,340
was only 12k,

647
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,530
just 2k more than that of the support.

648
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,660
From 12 minutes and 18 seconds onward,

649
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,850
there were a total of seven team fights, both large and small.

650
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,050
You only joined once,

651
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,060
and that was the only time K wasn't there.

652
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,920
That was also the only time we won.

653
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,310
With your stats

654
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,580
of zero kills, six deaths, and two assists,

655
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,300
you were practically sleepwalking through the whole game.

656
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,330
Aside from the participation rate and kill stats,

657
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,210
the rest of the team fights

658
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,190
and the fight that Cat joined and who didn't

659
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,870
are unrecorded data.

660
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,580
This is all stuff that Lu Sicheng has memorized in his head.

661
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,340
What a demon brain.

662
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,590
Indeed, Scorpio. Such a grudge-holder.

663
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,690
I didn't want to miss the team fights. I just couldn't hold them off.

664
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,550
My equipment was bad.

665
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,770
I was too far behind in coins.

666
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,530
My skills barely tickled him.

667
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,420
During the team fight for Orochi,

668
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,630
K was careless

669
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,790
and rushed into the enemy mid laners and jungler.

670
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,340
If you had come over right away using Shift,

671
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,060
you would have arrived at the same time as the enemy top laner,

672
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,030
and you would have had enough time to stall them.

673
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,310
You could have waited for K's

674
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,780
skills to come off cooldown and then turned around and killed the mid laner.

675
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,840
But what happened?

676
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,910
You didn't come.

677
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,940
While K,

678
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,140
at the crucial moment, why didn't you, as the jungler,

679
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,580
support Cat in time?

680
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,070
What were you thinking?

681
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,310
The enemy was camping top lane with three or four players.

682
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,390
Even if I went, it'd be a suicide.

683
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,690
But didn't we have Tong Yao?

684
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,550
Would she just watch you guys die?

685
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,250
Winning or losing a match doesn't matter.

686
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,130
I can accept it.

687
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,560
We lost to CK in the Spring Final.

688
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,840
Did we say anything?

689
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,550
But if you guys don't want to play

690
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,040
or if you're coming into the match

691
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,150
with a bad attitude,

692
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,280
I think you don't need to play anymore.

693
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,910
What?

694
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,260
Calm down and talk properly.

695
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,030
Think about it.

696
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,490
You can just protect them.

697
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,580
What kind of crazy name did you change it to?

698
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,070
Lu Yue changed it.

699
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,720
It seems to be right.

700
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,190
Right?

701
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,740
[Rabbit Hugs the Carrot Tight]

702
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,560
I changed this name to remind you

703
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,160
not to even think about

704
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,920
fooling around with your fans.

705
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,320
You're the only one.

706
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,740
Alright?

707
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,700
[I Wish to Bind You with a Red Rope]

708
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,660
You're being unreasonable.

709
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,810
What do you think?

710
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,030
How about this name?

711
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,070
And there is the second half.

712
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,960
"Remove your clothes

713
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,180
and carry you to the bridal chamber."

714
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,320
You rascal.

715
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,130
I wanted to talk business with you.

716
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,870
You're the one who changed the subject.

717
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,080
I told you not to protect those two kids on the team.

718
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,090
If you hadn't pressed their heads and made them admit their mistakes,

719
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,810
they would have just continued arguing.

720
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,690
Earlier, I analyzed it for you.

721
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,490
We needed to educate them with love.

722
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,520
I'm afraid that if you had said those things about benching them,

723
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,370
it would have triggered their rebellious mindset.

724
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,470
I've already told you,

725
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,540
when dealing with teammates, you need to have love and care.

726
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,740
This is all about the education of love.

727
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,490
If they're still like this in the next match,

728
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,810
are you really not going to do anything about it?

729
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,620
Don't worry.

730
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,290
They will be fine.

731
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,700
How did you know?

732
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,100
Because I'm the captain.

733
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,170
They can only be okay when I am okay.

734
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,420
Give them one night to adjust themselves.

735
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,450
If they still have

736
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,850
the same issues as this in the match,

737
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,940
you will see

738
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,940
what your captain looks like when his rebellious mindset is triggered.

739
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,770
Dictator.

740
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,630
Heh.

741
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,910
Take care of the mess you took on.

742
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,110
Otherwise, I'll scold you too.

743
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,070
I didn't take on any mess.

744
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,420
Captain, while you were analyzing things with them earlier,

745
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,820
I was looking at your handsome face so close,

746
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,870
thinking, "My man is so handsome."

747
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,300
"I really wanted to give you a kiss."

748
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,180
Too late.

749
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,160
Go. I'll make a backstab.

750
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,410
Give them a mirror.

751
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,990
Maybe from now on,

752
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,870
they'll have a very vivid and

753
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,550
three-dimensional understanding of the big, bold term "guilt."

754
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,340
K, solo queue?

755
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,490
Are you hungry?

756
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,200
How about asking Cat to get you something to eat?

757
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,930
Cat, K wants to duo queue with you.

758
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,910
Really?

759
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,580
Yes. Hurry up.

760
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,670
Let's go.

761
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,830
Silly top laner,

762
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,450
picked a damage-dealing shikigami,

763
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,900
but your damage output isn't even higher than that of support.

764
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,930
Not at all...

765
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,840
Cat wants to duo with you.

766
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,030
Give him some face.

767
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,350
Duo queue?

768
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,860
K,

769
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,360
you need to help Cat.

770
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,820
The enemy's clearly planning something.

771
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,940
Come on.

772
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,480
I'll go help Kitty in the top lane.

773
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,290
Who else is gonna help him if I don't?

774
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,420
Otherwise, he'll just blame me later.

775
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,090
Blame you? I wouldn't dare.

776
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,750
Cat.

777
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,980
K is here.

778
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,900
Hurry up and tank for him.

779
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,950
Okay, I got it.

780
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,340
Help him tank. Go. Go!

781
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,620
Come on! Kitty, switch lanes and attack.

782
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,250
And that's how we take care of this wave.

783
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,950
This is great.

784
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,500
We won this game.

785
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,610
You two make a perfect combo, perfect coordination.

786
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,080
Alright.

787
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,300
I'm done. I'm hungry.

788
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,210
I haven't eaten anything all day.

789
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,010
Then I'll treat you to your favorite braised pork?

790
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,950
Let's go.

791
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,260
We can also grab some of those Juewei duck necks.

792
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,330
Okay, let's go.

793
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,060
Let's go. Tong Yao, you coming?

794
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,510
No, you two go.

795
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,570
-We'll go then.
-Let's go.

796
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,910
Silly.

797
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,330
Looking for a fight, huh?

798
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,770
I can do it too.

799
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,820
Don't move.

800
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,389
Silly pig.

801
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,550
The education of love is now completed.

802
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,510
Please check it.

803
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,350
You've all been criticizing the mid laner, top laner, and jungler,

804
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,909
but does ZGDX's AD

805
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,540
really have no faults at all?

806
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,940
Now, even Chessman isn't being spared.

807
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,900
Amazing. Are you crazy?

808
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,360
The division of responsibilities is clear.

809
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,590
OP, you're not that fat support, are you?

810
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,860
Your mid laner isn't "the one female player in a sea of male players,"

811
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,790
but the disaster-bringer, Schemer Tong.

812
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,679
If this keeps up,

813
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,150
ZGDX is doomed.

814
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,929
You're meddling too much.

815
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,280
I don't want to say too many harsh words.

816
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,310
You're the one who hindered ZGDX from winning.

817
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,530
Please stop complicating things.

818
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,860
What are you looking at?

819
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,030
Nothing.

820
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,660
Just those posts online criticizing us.

821
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,120
Why did you come in without knocking again?

822
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,500
What's wrong?

823
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,920
I've been kidnapped.

824
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,580
Both morality and conscience.

825
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,110
Didn't we agree to grow together,

826
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,640
to become stronger together?

827
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,160
Why is it that now, your heart's shattered into pieces?

828
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm not.

829
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,750
I'm just thinking

830
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,190
we lost the game with Alpha,

831
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,350
so those posts online criticizing us

832
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,270
are normal.

833
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,850
But I'm more worried about the upcoming matches.

834
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,790
If we lose,

835
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,390
I'll really become the disaster-bringer

836
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,420
they say I am.

837
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,230
BS.

838
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,030
Cheng.

839
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,950
Don't you feel wronged

840
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,750
or regret it?

841
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,250
No.

842
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,030
I've never felt regret.

843
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,010
You're overthinking it.

844
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,110
If we had a perfect record in the qualifiers,

845
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,840
that would make people uneasy.

846
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,130
But I don't want to lose.

847
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,980
I don't want to lose, not even in the qualifiers.

848
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,180
And YQCB and FNATIC

849
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,430
are both strong teams.

850
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,120
Yeah.

851
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,310
That's why we need to adjust our mindset.

852
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,190
If we let our guard down for even a moment,

853
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,150
it may cause us to lose the game.

854
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,360
But that cause won't be you.

855
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,070
Also,

856
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,340
it's better to lose now

857
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,770
rather than in the knockout stage

858
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,050
or national finals.

859
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,480
Because when we reach that stage,

860
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,210
we really can't afford to lose.

861
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,840
Cheng.

862
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,210
Do you think I've been worrying too much about the team?

863
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,710
Shouldn't you reward me a little?

864
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,230
There's a match tomorrow, you rogue.

865
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,380
I know.

866
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,280
Don't worry.

867
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,860
We won't lose.

868
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,950
Okay. Okay.

869
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,240
Okay, I got it.

870
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,610
What's that supposed to mean?

871
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,890
I only stole a few kills from you.

872
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,650
Literally.

873
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,280
Everyone,

874
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,580
as the saying goes, "When it rains, it pours."

875
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,760
Recently, there have been numerous

876
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,400
negative comments about our team online,

877
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,270
so the club has arranged for our captain

878
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,290
to participate in a live esports interview

879
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,780
to help salvage our team's reputation.

880
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,750
Live interview?

881
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,450
Cheng, you must attend.

882
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,910
It counts as performance.

883
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,780
No.

884
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,710
You have to go.

885
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,050
The sponsor of this show

886
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,420
is a partner of our club.

887
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,310
Cheng, you have to cooperate,

888
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:04,330
or I'm afraid Ms. Wang will come and have a heart-to-heart talk with you.

889
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,910
Everyone, pay attention.

890
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,400
This is a crucial period for guiding public opinion.

891
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,550
When you see bad comments online,

892
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,160
you must stay calm and wise.

893
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,320
Stay wise.

894
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,970
Who are you talking about?

895
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,700
Don't get too emotional.

896
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,870
Remember,

897
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,310
peace and love.

898
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,930
Cheng, can we start now?

899
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,460
Cheng, thank you for taking the time

900
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,480
during the preparation

901
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,840
to accept our interview.

902
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,210
I'm also a fan of ZGDX.

903
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,950
So today we've selected

904
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,500
a few questions

905
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,910
that fans are discussing online,

906
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,670
and we would love to hear your thoughts on them.

907
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,310
Go ahead.

908
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,310
After the loss to Alpha,

909
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,650
did it have a big impact on the team?

910
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,540
Some say that Cat and K's relationship has broken down,

911
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,820
and some even claim

912
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,380
that ZGDX is falling apart.

913
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,590
What's your take on this?

914
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,870
That match against Alpha,

915
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,470
it's true that Cat and K

916
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,190
had some coordination issues,

917
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,720
but that was just one match.

918
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,510
As the captain,

919
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,360
my focus is on how to correct

920
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,950
the areas where we didn't do well,

921
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,100
not on the meaningless

922
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,180
hype online.

923
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,120
Cheng, can you tell us more about

924
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,110
the root cause of the loss?

925
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,630
The root cause?

926
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,690
A lot of fans have mentioned that,

927
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,140
while it may seem like the issue

928
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,470
was Cat and K's mistakes in coordination,

929
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,150
ZGDX has always had harmonious relationships

930
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,240
within the team since the God Ming era,

931
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,320
and this has never happened before.

932
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,330
So this time,

933
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,070
is the root cause of the team's failure

934
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,860
somehow related to the relationship

935
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,340
within the team?

936
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,640
Will the team members

937
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,310
be affected by your relationship

938
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,630
with Tong Yao?

939
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,950
First of all,

940
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,070
although Tong Yao is my teammate,

941
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,060
our relationship is a private matter.

942
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,920
It has nothing to do with the team.

943
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,700
Secondly,

944
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,230
to those who doubt that our team

945
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,510
has a fall-out because of my relationship

946
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,700
with Tong Yao,

947
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,120
I have only one answer:

948
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,150
if all of this is based on your wild speculation

949
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,070
and the absurd assumption

950
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,020
that ZGDX is about to end,

951
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,670
then please, close our match videos,

952
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,600
cancel your tickets to our games,

953
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,790
tear up our autographs,

954
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,910
burn our photos—

955
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,190
of course, if you have any—

956
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,720
and unfollow my Weibo.

957
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,800
Cheng, don't you think

958
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,010
you might hurt the hearts of your fans

959
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,970
who've been supporting you all along?

960
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,850
I'm grateful for your past

961
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,310
support and love.

962
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,510
But if you choose to leave, I won't feel regret.

963
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,750
You don't need to message me privately to let me know.

964
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,610
I won't read it.

965
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,170
Even if I did, I wouldn't regret it.

966
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,740
Goodbye, don't let the door hit you on your way out.

967
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,140
Cheng, don't you think

968
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,990
you should apologize for saying that to your fans?

969
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,800
What reason do I have to apologize?

970
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,870
If ZGDX loses our World Championships spot this year

971
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,340
because of our dual carries,

972
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
I will apologize.

973
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,030
But today, I won't.

974
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,350
Because ZGDX is still here.

975
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,100
We've only lost one match in the qualifiers.

976
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,380
If one loss

977
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,620
makes you think we're on the brink of collapse,

978
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,940
then I have to ask you:

979
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,890
Is that your so-called idea of supporting ZGDX?

980
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,020
I'm disappointed.

981
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,950
I'm sad too.

982
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,090
I even need to apologize to myself.

983
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,300
How did I end up with a bunch of fickle fans

984
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,940
who only follow the crowd?

985
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,890
And those internet

986
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,210
trolls online,

987
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,000
I ask you to retract your personal attacks on me,

988
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,320
against ZGDX and Tong Yao.

989
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,380
You need to remember one more thing:

990
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,230
the Internet is not a lawless place.

991
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,200
If you keep spreading maliciousness like this,

992
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,550
you may one day pay a much higher price

993
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,350
than you expect.

994
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,950
I'll say one last thing.

995
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,700
Don't imagine me to be so perfect.

996
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,360
I'm not, and I can't live up to that expectation.

997
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,520
Esports

998
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
and our mid-laner

999
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,680
are one and the same in my heart—

1000
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,160
can't have one without the other.

1001
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,410
Esports and our mid laner

1002
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,170
are one and the same in my heart.

1003
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,970
If you're not happy with that, you can unfollow me.

1004
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,710
I'm the one and the same in Cheng's heart.

1005
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,120
I apologize to you all for him.

1006
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,050
My youth is over.

1007
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,810
The strong and focused Chessman, who only cared about professional games,

1008
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,890
is gone and never coming back.

1009
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,160
Esports player, Schemer Tong.

1010
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,040
I now unfollow and roast you.

1011
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,410
I'll send you knife blades.

1012
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Not gonna happen.

1013
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,240
These keyboard trolls

1014
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,640
can only talk big online.

1015
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,790
They'll never actually follow through with their threats.

1016
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,390
It'll blow over in a few days.

1017
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,600
Such a big dose of toxic support.

1018
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,650
What's going on?

1019
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,950
Why has ZGDX's public image

1020
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,710
become so negative?

1021
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,230
Yeah.

1022
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,500
First, the relationship of the dual carries went public,

1023
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,250
and you didn't even leave us a chance

1024
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,280
to prepare for the backlash.

1025
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,610
Do you know how many fans

1026
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,140
canceled their orders

1027
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,960
just because their favorite players are in a relationship?

1028
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,230
This is nonsense!

1029
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,170
Yeah.

1030
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,600
Lu Sicheng, as the captain of ZGDX,

1031
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,810
not only has no sense of responsibility for the team's reputation

1032
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,920
but also no respect

1033
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,560
for our sponsors!

1034
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,550
Why has everything gotten so out of control now?

1035
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,190
Last time, we asked you to issue a statement

1036
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,070
that players' personal matters will be kept separate from the game,

1037
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,030
but now?

1038
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,060
Personal matters are affecting business matters.

1039
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,360
Who should take responsibility for this?

1040
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,020
Who can take responsibility?

1041
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,160
Yao,

1042
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,720
what's going on now?

1043
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,690
Why are people online attacking you so harshly?

1044
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,260
From childhood until now,

1045
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,590
when have you ever been treated like this?

1046
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,620
Are you okay?

1047
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,260
Mom, I'm fine.

1048
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,300
Those people online can say whatever they want;

1049
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,580
it won't hurt me.

1050
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,370
Don't worry about me.

1051
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,040
I'm going to training now. We have a match tomorrow.

1052
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,570
[Mother]

1053
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,490
I've warned you before

1054
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,490
that this path you've chosen wouldn't be easy.

1055
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,180
I know.

1056
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,790
I know what the club's stance is.

1057
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,000
If you can't stay on the team anymore,

1058
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,740
go home and take over our family business.

1059
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,780
How can you joke with me at this time?

1060
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,820
No one is joking with you.

1061
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,430
Forget about that thought.

1062
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,900
I will

1063
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,480
keep walking until the end on this path.

1064
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,110
Chessman,

1065
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,710
can you really do it without hesitation?
