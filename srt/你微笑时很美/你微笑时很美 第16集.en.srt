00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,030
Hello.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,270
Miss.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,790
Can you say hello

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,270
to my fans?

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,730
Hello everyone,

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,960
I'm Smiling from ZGDX.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,780
They say we make a good match.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,390
Cheng isn't usually this fierce.

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,860
Eat more. Don't be nervous.

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,720
If you want to eat, help yourself.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,710
Just look at her shouting during the matches.

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,820
She's just too adorable.

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,530
If it happens again, I'll throw up.

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,850
It's like asking for permission from future father-in-law.

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,850
Please, I beg you.

16
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,990
I've said

17
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,590
that she's my woman.

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,350
You're showing off like a peacock yourself,

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,070
while ruining others' chances at love.

20
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,400
Is that the one you had the blind date with?

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,660

[Episode 16]

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,800
Hello, dear viewers.

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,160
Welcome to the 2020

25
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,810
Onmyoji Professional League,

26

live broadcast.

27
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,460
This is your commentator Heng.

28
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,210
Hello everyone,

29
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,540
I'm the most handsome commentator, Shuo.

30
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,410
The teams competing in today's match are

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,730
Team ZGDX and Team Arashi.

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,390
I'm sure you've all been looking forward to

33
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,150
this match for a long time.

34
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,440
Alright, viewers...

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,900
What are you grinning about?

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,970
Today's match is getting interesting.

37
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,610
Explain.

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,000
Poker-faced Lu Sicheng

39
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,860
and his passionate blind date, Su Luo.

40
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,550
No, average-looking Su Luo.

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,460
And Shorty Smiling

42
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,280
and Kun, who has a secret crush on her.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,990
Four of them are on the same stage.

44
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,840
What is this?

45
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,630
It's a huge love battlefield.

46
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,340
Alright, K, keep up.

47
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,500
-Coming.
-I can use my ultimate skill this round.

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,380
Okay, do it.

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,270
Pang, leave your ult for Tong Yao.

50
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,690
What's going on?

51
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,830
Something's going on behind the match.

52
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,990
Yes!

53
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,050
Yes!

54
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,750
The match just now

55
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,110
was truly exhilarating!

56
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,420
It was just so thrilling!

57
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,329
That's right. My heart is still racing!

58
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,700
Team ZGDX is really worth their reputation.

59
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,550
They just showed off

60
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,190
their incredible adaptability.

61
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,430
They truly deserve their spot in the top tier.

62
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,110
Exactly.

63
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,070
But the only thing I find regrettable is...

64
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,350
As expected, once we didn't pick Mannendake,

65
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,579
Tamamonomae would carry the whole team.

66
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,310
You bet.

67
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,980
Our Tong Yao was in top form today.

68
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,810
Incredible.

69
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,770
Let's go, K.

70
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,510
Let's go.

71
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,930
What's wrong?

72
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,860
When this type of woman appears in Korean dramas,

73
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,390
what does the female lead usually do about it?

74
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,750
You've got an eyelash here.

75
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,610
What's wrong?

76
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,280
Nothing, nothing.

77
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,970
You're acting weird.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,870
Lu Sicheng.

79
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,550
Bye.

80
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,830
Congratulations on your victory in the match.

81
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,750
Thank you.

82
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,670
Help, help, help!

83
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,330
I suddenly, for no reason,

84
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,659
had evil and malicious thoughts

85
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,310
about a complete stranger.

86
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,130
Welcome to the adult world.

87
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,880
It's really strange behavior,

88
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,140
like a yellow dog

89
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,970
secretly peeing on a utility pole

90
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,010
within another dog's territory.

91
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,840
Silly girl, that's just your biological stress response kicking in.

92
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,720
By the way,

93
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,250
on which utility pole did you secretly pee?

94
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,310
The one at the entrance of Lu Village?

95
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,130
Cheng, you've finally acknowledged me.

96
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,120
High-quality packaging, high-end variety.

97
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,990
The person who sent flowers to our captain

98
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,860
has good taste and is very sincere.

99
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,390
A bouquet this size must have cost quite a bit.

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,190
Cheng.

101
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,260
That was your fan just now?

102
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,740
It was sent by his fiancée.

103
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,710
Already upgraded to fiancée status?

104
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,470
Then what about our Tong Yao?

105
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,700
They slept together, and it's just over like that?

106
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,740
What?

107
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,230
♫I heard raindrops falling on the green grass♫

108
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,720
♫I heard the distant bell of betrayal ringing♫

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,370
♫Yet I still can't hear your voice♫

110
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,000
♫Say, I'm truly sorry♫

111
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,770
♫Maybe back then I was too busy smiling and crying♫

112
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,240
♫Too busy chasing♫

113
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,000
Hey, you guys! That's enough. Is this fun for you?

114
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,360
So that's why I felt betrayed

115
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,030
while washing my hands downstairs in the training base.

116
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,490
Turns out our Tong Yao was washing her hair on the second floor!

117
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,720
Get lost.

118
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,820
-So funny.
-Are you done?

119
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,180
What fiancée?

120
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,570
Making up a whole drama in your head.

121
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,290
It's all in what's left unsaid.

122
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,300
Cheng, what's with that calm expression of yours?

123
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,550
Are you secretly happy inside?

124
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,590
You have a girlfriend and didn't even tell us?

125
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,060
Do you even consider us teammates?

126
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,990
How are we supposed to

127
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,990
trust you with our backs

128
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,090
in the game like this?

129
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,610
Right?

130
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,050
Yeah.

131
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,220
I thought Cheng would never fall for a human.

132
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,420
After spending every day with people like you,

133
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,750
how could I possibly...

134
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,710
Hello.

135
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,260
Excuse me.

136
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,200
Why is he here again?

137
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,740
How would I know?

138
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,410
Sis, here, eat this.

139
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,940
It's really delicious.

140
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,000
I've prepared it especially for you.

141
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,260
It can supply energy.

142
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,820
Good for your health.

143
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,790
Th-thank you.

144
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,620
Eat it. It's really tasty.

145
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,320
If you eat one pack every day,

146
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,800
you'll think of me every day.

147
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,360
Thank you.

148
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,270
What are you doing?

149
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,950
Why are you coming to our lounge again and again

150
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,310
and openly flirting with my woman?

151
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,990
I'm just sending her some food.

152
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,820
It's good for her health.

153
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,430
Cheng, you haven't seen

154
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,680
how overly attentive I can be to a girl in Korea.

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,309
I would pull down the stars from the sky

156
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,240
and give them all to the girl I like.

157
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,030
Sis,

158
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
you're very cute.

159
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,350
Bye-bye.

160
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,590
What's going on?

161
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,870
He didn't ask for our WeChat numbers

162
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,800
because he already has all of them.

163
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,990
Why are you the only one with mixed nuts,

164
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,180
and we don't?

165
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,530
I don't even need to think,

166
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,330
and I've already imagined a whole drama in my head.

167
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,850
Time's up. You guys should...

168
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,030
What's going on here?

169
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,030
First flowers, then snacks from Bestore.

170
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,830
We only have a ten-minute break,

171
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,110
and you're planning to throw a party or something?

172
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,270
You're really getting carried away.

173
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,060
Our mid and bot lanes are irresistibly charming.

174
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,960
That's right.

175
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:25,990
You?

176
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,310
Except for me.

177
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,950
What's going on?

178
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,160
The jungler from Team FNATIC

179
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,220
is trying to marry into our team.

180
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,950
He's brought mixed nuts here as a betrothal gift.

181
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,640
Kun?

182
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,310
He is chasing after our Tong Yao?

183
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,660
He was camping our mid lane like crazy last game,

184
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,120
going straight for my girl's head.

185
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,850
And he still hopes to marry her?

186
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,850
My girl?

187
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,750
I must say, you pro players really have

188
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,210
a unique sense of romance.

189
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,150
As the team captain, let me give you a piece of advice.

190
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,880
What?

191
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,630
Stay away from that guy, Kun.

192
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,380
But the mixed nuts he sent are delicious.

193
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,290
Who's being so jealous in here?

194
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,860
Why do I taste salt in the air?

195
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,470
It's so salty. The salt is off the charts.

196
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,070
It's so salty. It's so salty.

197
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,980
All of you

198
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,590
are minding things that don't concern you.

199
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,150
Let's go. Let's go. It's time to play.

200
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,170
Let's go. Let's go.

201
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,710
Let's go then.

202
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,070
♫I heard raindrops falling on the green grass♫

203
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,120
♫I heard the distant bell of betrayal ringing♫

204
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,230
Alright, alright.

205
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,690
Hurry up.

206
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,900
Stop it.

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,870
You can do it! Come on!

208
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,770
We can do it. We can take him.

209
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,290
Coming.

210
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,630
Attack. Keep it steady. Keep it steady.

211
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,590
Slow down. Slow down.

212
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,390
Go, go, go!

213
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,380
Good, this position is perfect!

214
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,510
Play it steadily. Play it steadily.

215
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,020
-Yes!
-Nice!

216
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,340
Cool, right?

217
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,800
Come on.

218
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,270
Chessman! Chessman!

219
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,550
Sis, congratulations on winning the match.

220
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,750
Chessman! Chessman!

221
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,400
Smiling!

222
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,860
What's going on?

223
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,130
You can't even walk without stumbling. What, are your bones made of tofu?

224
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,510
It was your support that stepped on my shoe first.

225
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,430
What are you two doing in front of everyone?

226
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,570
A princess carry, huh?

227
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,030
It's a princess carry without a princess.

228
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,150
Can you focus on the main part?

229
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
Put me down first.

230
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,270
Put me down.

231
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,210
They're together now?

232
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,180
They must be together now.

233
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,150
It's the first time I've seen

234
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,330
such a unique way for the MVP to make an entrance.

235
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,260
What a grand display of affection.

236
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,330
There must be something going on between them.

237
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,830
Congratulations to Team ZGDX

238
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,160
for defeating Team Arashi with an impressive score of 2-0,

239
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,670
successfully securing this match.

240
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,840
Regarding this excellent performance,

241
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,900
Smiling, do you have anything to say?

242
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,700
I'm... very satisfied.

243
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,010
Thanks to my teammates for carrying me to victory.

244
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,010
I hope to maintain this momentum

245
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,870
all the way through to the challenge match.

246
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,770
Smiling is truly modest and straightforward.

247
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,710
As we all know,

248
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,440
Smiling

249
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,870
is the only girl

250
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,910
in the OPL.

251
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,350
So, everyone wants to know,

252
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,790
as a female professional player,

253
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,090
have you encountered any difficulties in life,

254
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,880
or have you had to deal with more troubles

255
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,280
than other male players?

256
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,750
It's okay.

257
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,570
I was very nervous at first.

258
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,070
I was afraid I wouldn't fit in with everyone.

259
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,690
Whether she stays or not

260
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,420
will depend on her performance in the first game.

261
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,430
Later, I found that everyone was very kind.

262
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,390
Miss,

263
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,390
welcome to Team ZGDX.

264
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,270
Good luck.

265
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,700
To our dreams.

266
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,890
To our dreams!

267
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,890
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

268
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,950
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

269
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,810
It seems that no one gives me special treatment

270
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,140
just because I'm a girl.

271
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,840
Cheers.

272
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,540
This is actually the best.

273
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,650
Get lost.

274
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,960
I guess in their eyes,

275
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,320
a girl playing professionally

276
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,200
isn't such a big deal.

277
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,480
They've never thought that way.

278
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,950
I know that many people think

279
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,070
girls can't be good at math,

280
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,690
that girls aren't rational enough,

281
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,290
that girls are road hazards,

282
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,360
and that in various fields,

283
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,370
girls are always inferior to boys.

284
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,830
But I want to say

285
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,270
these are blatant biases.

286
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,950
For anything,

287
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,780
if girls want to do well,

288
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,330
we can do it just as well.

289
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,580
Esports

290
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,780
shouldn't be a field only for boys.

291
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,210
I hope that those with these stubborn ideas

292
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,540
can change their minds.

293
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,190
Cheng,

294
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,200
you've never publicly thanked me,

295
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,880
not even with a word of praise.

296
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,920
As a support, I feel really upset.

297
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,690
It's just that he's never praised any of us.

298
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,760
Cheng has publicly praised Tong Yao before.

299
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,380
But wait a moment.

300
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,300
We have an impromptu additional question today.

301
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,750
After you finished thanking the audience just now,

302
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,250
when you were walking back,

303
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,570
what exactly happened

304
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,390
that made Chessman suddenly turn around

305
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,850
and pick you up in his arms?

306
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,670
To be honest,

307
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,660
I never thought I'd witness such a romantic scene

308
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,480
on the OPL stage.

309
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,410
It was because Pang accidentally stepped on my shoe

310
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,450
that I tripped,

311
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
and then he caught me.

312
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,080
But lately, all the major gossip sites

313
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,310
have been discussing you and our Cheng.

314
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,630
There is nothing between us.

315
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,170
It's just that he occasionally pulls some flashy moves

316
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,570
and says some wild stuff.

317
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,920
Please don't let him set the tone.

318
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,230
If our captain

319
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,310
ever decides to start liking humans

320
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,950
and be with me,

321
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,790
I'll definitely send out wedding invitations and announce it to the world.

322
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,150
Will you really tell us?

323
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,190
I'll stand on the stage with a megaphone and shout it out.

324
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,740
Thank you very much, Smiling, for accepting my interview.

325
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,250
Well, that's the end of today's interview.

326
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,590
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

327
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,320
Thank you.

328
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,110
Thank you.

329
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,170
Hello, everyone.

330
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,180
I'm a reporter for Esports Farm.

331
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,050
ZGDX won against Team Arashi with a score of 2-0.

332
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,000
But that's not the main point.

333
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,820
The point is that a fan was spilling the tea to us.

334
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,210
They said that among the fans seated in the first row of

335
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,850
the ZGDX section,

336
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,530
there was a girl whose behavior was particularly strange.

337
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,700
She's obviously not from the esports scene.

338
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,020
While everyone else was busy

339
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,609
taking photos of player Kun, who was right in front of them,

340
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,369
she inexplicably asked,

341
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,930
"Who is he? Why are people taking his photos?"

342
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,829
Moreover,

343
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,630
at the start of the first match,

344
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,560
there was a large bouquet of flowers next to her seat.

345
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,290
At the end of the first match,

346
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,160
she left with the flowers.

347
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,670
When the second match started,

348
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,960
she came back, but the flowers were gone.

349
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,250
When someone asked her

350
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,839
whose fan she was,

351
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,240
she said, "I'm Lu Sicheng's friend."

352
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,460
And,

353
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,340
according to the on-site staff,

354
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,090
when they passed by the backstage, they personally saw

355
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,730
a girl giving flowers to Lu Sicheng.

356
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,630
The two clearly knew each other.

357
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,030
They even exchanged a few words.

358
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,690
Afterward,

359
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,380
it seemed like

360
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,100
the girl left unhappily.

361
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,720

363
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,510
Same time tomorrow, don't miss it.

364
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,560
You're back.

365
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,770
Wear these.

366
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,720
Come on, change into these.

367
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,470
Where did you get these?

368
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,160
Cheng got them for you from the hotel next door.

369
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,630
He is that nice?

370
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,240
Hurry and wear these.

371
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,960
Let's go.

372
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,410
Aren't we taking these flowers?

373
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,760
Cheng didn't say to take them.

374
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,480
They're about to bloom.

375
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,570
It would be a waste to throw them away.

376
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,400
Let's go.

377
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,860
What are you doing?

378
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,050
Isn't it too wasteful to throw them away?

379
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,200
You weren't worried about waste when you tossed Jian Yang's flowers.

380
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,950
Where are we going?

381
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,750
Cheng said he's buying us shoes.

382
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,020
So cool.

383
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,980
Look, they're all so tall.

384
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,330
How about this one?

385
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,080
It looks pretty good.

386
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,820
This pair, then. Tell me your shoe sizes.

387
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,430
43.

388
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,190
44.

389
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:21,980
41.

390
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,630
36.

391
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,910
What's wrong?

392
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,010
My shoe size is 36.

393
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,410
Go ahead, fire me if you can.

394
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,640
What's so great about size 36?

395
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,370
What's there to show off about?

396
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,290
This is the men's version. The smallest size available is 39.

397
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,690
I'll go check if there's a women's version.

398
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,630
What a coincidence.

399
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,740
We have the style you like in women's sizes.

400
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,800
Here, try these on.

401
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,120
You really look good in these shoes.

402
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,740
They match well with men's shoes too.

403
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,340
Looks like a couple's style.

404
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,820
Couple's style.

405
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,290
Then I'll keep looking.

406
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,130
No need to choose anymore. It'll be dark before you're done.

407
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,960
Have some discipline.

408
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,360
That pair it is. I'll pay.

409
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,150
This way.

410
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,110
I remember now.

411
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,520
He is that...

412
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,350
That player from Team ZGDX.

413
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,240
Yes, yes, yes.

414
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,350
He's so handsome. Really handsome.

415
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,520
He's such a heartthrob. Really handsome.

416
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,320
That's right.

417
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,580
Yeah, let me show you a photo.

418
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,470
Look.

419
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,870
That's him in the photo.

420
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,770
-So handsome.
-Yeah.

421
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,010
That's his girlfriend, right?

422
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah.

423
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,350
She's so beautiful.

424
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,470
Right? They both have such long legs.

425
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,870
I'm so envious.

426
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,680
They're such a good match. I really like them.

427
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,640
I want a boyfriend like him too.

428
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,420
He carried her.

429
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,270
And you guys were saying that Smiling is too short for your Cheng.

430
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,380
Well, now you see,

431
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,280
at least she can play games.

432
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,710
I agree with the above. I think she did it intentionally too.

433
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,310
Cheng has been a pro player for so long without much gossip.

434
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,240
What's this woman up to?

435
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,640
I didn't expect this girl

436
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,870
to cause so much trouble by just sending flowers.

437
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,090
These netizens at this moment

438
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,100
have all turned into esports Sherlock Holmes.

439
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,820
As for whether that girl did it intentionally or not,

440
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,350
I think...

441
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,590
I'm going to throw some shade with my female intuition.

442
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,790
She did it on purpose.

443
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,490
Now, I think she did it on purpose too.

444
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,860
Looks like the media team will be working overtime tonight.

445
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,570
Who is she?

446
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,300
The other plans you mentioned

447
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,160
were just to buy shoes, right?

448
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,090
Who is this girl?

449
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,870
Now that you've done shopping,

450
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,210
can you come have dinner with me?

451
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:37,930
Who is she?

452
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,590
I'm busy.

453
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,960
What are you doing?

454
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,320
I didn't add you to my brother's WeChat

455
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,720
for you to cause trouble.

456
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,400
Do you know that there are rumors all over the internet now,

457
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,590
saying that my brother is dating

458
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,810
and has even brought his girlfriend to the venue?

459
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,920
You even came and sent him flowers?

460
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,120
What's with all this?

461
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,090
So what?

462
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,850
Are gamers not allowed to date,

463
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,700
or what?

464
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,790
How old is he anyway?

465
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,510
Can't he have a life of his own?

466
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,470
You woman, you did this on purpose.

467
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,410
So what if I did all of this on purpose?

468
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,530
Those female fans,

469
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,170
what do they think they are?

470
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,840
Calling him "my husband" without any shame.

471
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,850
Might as well let them give up hope.

472
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,060
When you enter a community,

473
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,690
you need to follow its rules.

474
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,270
Since when did gaming become a community?

475
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,460
So you're picking a fight with me, huh?

476
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,100
Do you know

477
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,470
how much trouble you're causing for our team

478
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,910
and for my brother?

479
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,450
Who knows what the newspapers will write tomorrow?

480
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,380
If it's in the news, so be it.

481
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,860
It's a good chance to increase exposure.

482
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,010
After all, our families

483
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,630
are just waiting for us to date and get married.

484
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,690
[Added to blacklist]

485
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,890
It's not that gamers can't date.

486
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,150
It's that we can't date someone like you.

487
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,620
You...

488
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,270
Please delete my brother's WeChat account on your own.

489
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,590
Stop harassing him.

490
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,390
What's it to you?

491
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,610
Go ahead and try, and you'll see.

492
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,420
You...

493
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
Stop following us.

494
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,850
Wait for me!

495
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,950
What?

496
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,450
Jinyang said receiving shoes as a gift brings bad luck.

497
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,520
You should give the person who sends you the shoes some money to ward off bad luck.

498
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,910
What backwater did you come from before becoming a pro player in the city?

499
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,810
Is your family even connected to the internet?

500
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,980
Ungrateful.

501
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,770
That superstition only applies to couples.

502
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,230
Then give it back to me.

503
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,360
You think I won't be able to find it just because you tossed it in there?

504
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,160
Take your time.

505
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,350
Lu Sicheng, you're so childish.

506
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,500
Cheng, Cheng,

507
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,340
who was that woman today?

508
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,190
That woman? Which woman?

509
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,880
How do you guys know everything?

510
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,900
Are you Sherlock Holmes or something?

511
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,880
She's nobody.

512
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,810
She's just a blind date arranged by my family.

513
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,430
Why do you need blind dates?

514
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,660
What do you mean by that?

515
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,250
I'm of legal age for marriage,

516
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,220
and I'm an adult.

517
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,460
Why can't I go on blind dates?

518
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,750
Everything is fine. Everything is fine.

519
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,710
But I refused.

520
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,230
Don't date right now.

521
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,880
Yeah,

522
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,600
I don't want to think about that now.

523
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,060
I want to marry the World Championship trophy,

524
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,070
with a grand wedding procession and all.

525
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,590
You rejected her but still added her on WeChat.

526
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,320
I deleted her contact ages ago.

527
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,190
You can even hear that?

528
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,920
It's not about appearance or compatibility.

529
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,170
It's that I dare not take a girl who isn't part of this world.

530
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,630
We'd break up sooner or later, wasting time.

531
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,580
Why wouldn't we break up?

532
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,510
Shorty.

533
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,560
Tell us your story.

534
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,910
What story?

535
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,150
I'm still young. I don't understand anything.

536
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,950
I've already devoted all my youth and dreams

537
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,340
to esports.

538
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,750
See that?

539
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,910
If you want to know more details,

540
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,570
don't ask me; go ask Jian Yang.

541
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,750
Yeah, the one from Team CK.

542
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,880
And that one who said earlier that they used to think Tong Yao was short,

543
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,470
but now in comparison, she is not bad

544
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,590
and could match me.

545
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,320
Mod, get to work. Ban him for a month.

546
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,250
The reason is insulting my teammate for being short.

547
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,790
What's my type?

548
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,090
Haven't I said before?

549
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,860
Someone who's better at games than I am.

550
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
Did you hear that?

551
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,750
Our captain doesn't like humans at all.

552
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,690
You can all rest easy now.

553
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,420
Come on, Shorty. Let's go solo.

554
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,390
Solo?

555
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,350
Solo?

556
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,470
That exciting?

557
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,280
Seriously.

558
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,220
It wasn't easy to gather you all

559
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
to watch the fun, huh?

560
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,910
Tonight,

561
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,200
the ZGDX training base will host

562
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,130
a solo competition, with late-night snacks as the grand prize.

563
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,570
The contestants: Tong Yao and Lu Sicheng!

564
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,670
To the spectators around,

565
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,760
please keep your mouths shut while watching the match.

566
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,060
Of course, the usual rule:

567
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,790
the loser treats everyone to a late-night snack.

568
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,390
Wait.

569
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,510
Why do I have to solo him?

570
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,200
If you want a late-night snack, you can ask him to treat you.

571
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,800
That's because our Cheng

572
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,580
wants to prove today that in this world

573
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,750
no girl is better at gaming than him.

574
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,040
So, girls, give up your hopes.

575
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,850
Cat,

576
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,020
are you stupid?

577
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,230
What's wrong?

578
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,310
Sis.

579
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,260
You can do it. If you win, we'll have crayfish.

580
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,140
-Come on.
-Go.

581
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
Even if I don't play this solo,

582
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,980
I can still treat you to a late-night snack.

583
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,250
It's not a proper crayfish feast

584
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,560
if one person can't eat ten pounds at once.

585
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Right, otherwise, we won't be full.

586
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,430
I'll try my best to win.

587
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,030
-Come on.
-You can do it.

588
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,410
Why are you still live streaming?

589
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,070
Do online viewers also get treated to crawfish?

590
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,690
It's like watching Cheng's "Competition for a Bride."

591
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,450
This room is his arena.

592
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,520
I want to try too. What if I win?

593
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,300
If you keep making noise, I'll turn off the live chat.

594
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,660
Do you know the rules for the solo?

595
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,790
Yes, three kills and one tower, right?

596
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,600
Pay attention.

597
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,630
Cheng is about to announce

598
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,770
the rules for his "Competition for a Bride."

599
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,730
Can Miss win the captain's heart?

600
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,010
I request to join in.

601
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,410
Cheng, tell me about it.

602
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,350
Cheng turned off the live chat without warning.

603
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,270
The viewers can't comment anymore.

604
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,200
How tsundere.

605
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,190
Okay, our MC, Pang, is online.

606
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,030
Hello, everyone.

607
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,550
Now, I'll introduce to you

608
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,900
the rules of the solo.

609
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,200
First, no onmyodo.

610
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,780
Second, no spells like Heal or Cleanse

611
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,180
are allowed.

612
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,150
Third, fight in the middle lane.

613
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,340
The bushes on either side of mid lane are the boundaries.

614
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,430
Crossing the boundary is considered forfeiting.

615
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,060
Fourth, the core rule:

616
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,940
the winner is determined by either killing the opponent three times

617
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,350
or destroying one of the opponent's towers.

618
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,160
To keep it fair,

619
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,240
neither player can use their signature shikigami

620
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,260
and have to choose shikigamis from the same class.

621
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,930
Alright, then warrior, assassin, or support?

622
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,580
Support?

623
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,600
Warrior.

624
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,960
Okay, the solo begins now!

625
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,360
Let's go.

626
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,140
Cheer up.

627
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,550
How could you miss minions under the tower?

628
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,310
Shut up.

629
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,520
Cheng has reached level six early.

630
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,050
Sis, you need to be careful.

631
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,940
Sis has also reached level six.

632
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,110
But Cheng has no intention of

633
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,380
giving her a chance to counterattack.

634
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:00,940
Pang.

635
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,010
You did that on purpose just now, didn't you?

636
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,590
Was it that obvious?

637
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,030
This is going to be tough.

638
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,040
Three kills or one tower. Calm down.

639
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,640
Come on, sis!

640
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,610
It's okay. We can take our time.

641
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,550
Cheng, what are you doing?

642
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,570
What's with you suddenly being so aggressive?

643
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,970
There's a chance. CC him.

644
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,160
Go after them!

645
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,210
Crawfish is back in sight!

646
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,830
The current score is tied at 2-2.

647
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,970
Both players have reached the max level with six full items.

648
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:22,770
So next,

649
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,980
will sis

650
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,860
take the captain's head in one go,

651
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,340
or...

652
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,190
Get the kill.

653
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,610
And start our joyful crayfish feast,

654
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,090
or will our captain defeat her

655
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,870
and prove the legend that he doesn't love humans?

656
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,780
Let's stay tuned!

657
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,530
Speaking as a top laner who's played thousands of games,

658
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,190
I want to say

659
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,620
a max-level Shuten Doji

660
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,630
can't beat a max-level Ibaraki Doji.

661
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,830
It also depends on...

662
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,930
who's playing.

663
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,050
Is that so?

664
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,150
Yeah.

665
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,240
Shoot.

666
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,150
I have to say,

667
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,270
Cheng is really sneaky.

668
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,720
He deals enough damage and runs away.

669
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,640
So annoying.

670
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,270
Whether we can eat crayfish depends on this round.

671
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,070
Shut up, all of you. I'm done for.

672
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,220
Come on, sis.

673
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:47,980
Go, sis. Go, sis.

674
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:23,699
Go, sis! Go, sis!

675
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:58,000
Crayfish! Crayfish! Crayfish!

676
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,940
I got it. Get your paws off me.

677
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,640
These paws just defeated you.

678
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,790
Hello.

679
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,440
Let's...

680
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,050
meet up later.

681
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,530
Okay.

682
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,620
Who is it?

683
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,810
Su Luo.

684
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,880
She said she wanted to meet me for the last time tonight,

685
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,540
and after that, she wouldn't bother me anymore.

686
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,380
You have to go meet her?

687
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,510
If I said I wasn't going, she'd come to the training base.

688
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,290
Let's go, Cat.

689
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,170
Let's hit the gym.

690
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,440
Didn't we just go this morning?

691
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,190
We're going to eat so many crayfish for a late-night snack.

692
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,640
We need to exercise in advance.

693
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,200
Otherwise, we'll gain several pounds by tomorrow.

694
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,730
Let's go.

695
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,640
Yeah, yeah, I'll go exercise too.

696
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,570
So I can eat more crayfish tonight.

697
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,900
Call me when the crayfish arrives.

698
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
I'm going to have a brief meeting with God Ming.

699
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,230
You haven't set foot in the gym for ages,

700
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,430
and now you're telling me you're going?

701
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,260
Cheng?

702
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,090
Cheng?

703
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,870
You're listening to my playlist but ignoring me?

704
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,130
Aren't you afraid of going deaf with the volume set so high?

705
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,460
I don't want you to go.
