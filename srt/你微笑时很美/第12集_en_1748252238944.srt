1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,400
Pull your pants first.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,280
I'm going to pull my pants.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,600
You're pulling your pants?

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,320
Then stay away from me.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,000
No.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,840
I'm getting up.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,280
I saw you were sick.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,760
I came to take care of you.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,680
I got a fever.

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,240
But I didn't get a headache.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,680
It's too hot.

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,600
I need to get a new one.

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,720
Don't sit.

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,600
Drink another sip.

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,600
You need to drink more hot water.

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Then you go to sleep.

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,880
I'll call you when the table is ready.

19
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Super- apt!

20
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,200
That was touching.

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,800
robbery

22
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,220
Go get it.

23
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,100
What's wrong?

24
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,700
Nothing.

25
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,060
I thought you would still sleep.

26
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,060
Chen...

27
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,220
He's still asleep.

28
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,760
He is sleeping on his own

29
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,760
if you have somethingworms in you,

30
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,800
he will bother you for a moment.

31
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,460
Do you know this bad habit?

32
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,920
How are you going to learn to study?

33
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,360
I don't want him to get worse when someone Film our family's reputation,

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,680
we couldn't evenlett the sound of the tone,

35
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,600
you had to say the sound of the urgent need of theAnytime.

36
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,600
Cheng'er,

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,120
looked out for a few other beds in this house

38
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,660
He must have crushed purl bed's prior room.

39
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,660
Oh, my goodness.

40
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
She's graduated from college and can get married.

41
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,660
This is a classic.

42
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,660
This is not a classic.

43
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,660
This is indeed not a classic.

44
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Then why is it a classic?

45
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Cheng Niang is not allowed to do it.

46
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,660
Cheng Niang, you are a professional.

47
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,660
How can I explain to a girl like you?

48
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,660
No, no.

49
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,660
You should get someone first.

50
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,660
How?

51
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,660
This is so disgusting.

52
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
You are too mean.

53
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
Cheng Niang.

54
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
You talk nicely.

55
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,660
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

56
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
You go down first.

57
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,660
I'll get her first.

58
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
Are you satisfied with this attitude?

59
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,660
Yes.

60
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,660
Very satisfied.

61
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,660
You can leave now.

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,660
Then leave.

63
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,660
Then leave.

64
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
I won't leave.

65
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
You go first.

66
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Go.

67
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
Otherwise, you'll be too much.

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
Go, go, go.

69
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,660
Go, go, go.

70
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Go, go, go.

71
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,660
Really?

72
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,660
Go.

73
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,660
I'll go first.

74
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,660
Go, go, go.

75
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Isn't this my room?

76
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,660
Get up.

77
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm sorry, Cheng Niang.

78
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,660
I was confused last night.

79
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
It was too cold.

80
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Then I fell down.

81
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
You should put on the ancient belt.

82
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
Do you need to wear the gold bracelet?

83
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,660
Maybe.

84
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,660
I should take you the 800th time.

85
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
I'll take you the 800th time.

86
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
I'll take you the 800th time.

87
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
I'll take you the 800th time.

88
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,660
You can't do this.

89
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
You're here to cheat me, right?

90
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,660
Cheat?

91
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
What cheat?

92
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
Are you begging me?

93
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
I'm asking you.

94
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
Are you...

95
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,660
Forget it.

96
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
I'll make you pay.

97
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
What cheat?

98
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,660
I'm a man with 800,000 years of age.

99
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Do you like cheating me?

100
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
So you really want to be a good man.

101
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
What are you looking for?

102
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
Do you see if you're cheating me?

103
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,660
What are you doing?

104
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
Stop it.

105
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
I'll write it for you if you cheat me.

106
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
Can't you just give up on your job?

107
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
I've been drinking for you for many times.

108
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
Try it.

109
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,660
I'll be your horse next time.

110
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
No, I have a check.

111
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
No, give it to me.

112
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Don't look.

113
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
No.

114
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
Give it to me.

115
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
No.

116
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
Give it to me.

117
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
I won't.

Give it to me.

Why didn't you just make a fool of it?

128
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,660
If I did, I'll write it for you.

129
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,260
Wait for me.

194
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,220
Wait for me.

195
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,060
Hit the button.

196
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,660
Don't worry.

197
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,980
Wait for me.

198
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,460
I'll be back.

199
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,460
You're so beautiful.

200
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,580
I'm going to buy a bag.

201
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,020
Go.

202
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,180
Okay.

203
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,380
Why are you all on live?

204
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,340
You're so diligent.

205
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,140
If you have time to ask me,

206
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,900
why don't you take your time to do your live?

207
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,380
I'm not a human being.

208
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,300
I just want to know.

209
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,820
Only 45 hours a month.

210
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,780
I don't have much time left.

211
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,820
I've already signed the contract.

212
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,940
And Brother Rui said

213
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,340
I can make a discount this month.

214
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,900
3 times this week, 5 hours.

215
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,540
Plus the last week, 25, 30.

216
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
My god.

217
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,220
I still have 32 hours left.

218
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
I see.

219
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,220
Welcome to the hell.

220
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,460
Welcome to hell.

221
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,660
The special attention of you,

222
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,380
ZGDX Smiling is on live.

223
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,820
Open the F and have a look.

224
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,580
Hello, I'm Smiling.

225
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,220
I'm on live now.

226
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,660
Today is the legendary

227
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,100
Moonless Human Series.

228
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,780
Yes.

229
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,500
Live for 8 hours without sleep.

230
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,500
Thank you for your love.

231
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,340
I haven't been on live for so many days.

232
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,540
Do you miss me?

233
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,820
Although I haven't been on live for these days,

234
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,740
we are actually training every day.

235
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,340
Captain.

236
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,340
Is it good?

237
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,380
Of course it's good.

238
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,660
There are a lot of monsters in training.

239
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
Of course it's good.

240
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,860
It's good to see your ex-girlfriend.

241
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
Look.

242
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,860
I'm leaving.

243
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,460
What if the live is not enough?

244
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Mr. Kou.

245
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,060
But a poor person like me

246
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
won't give the team a chance to experience this.

247
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,060
So,

248
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,460
maybe it's been a long time.

249
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,660
Everyone is in the live room.

250
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
You often see me.

251
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,660
Okay.

252
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,860
Start the rehearsal.

253
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,660
I'll start first.

254
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,460
What should I do?

255
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,260
Let me think.

256
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Let me think.

257
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,260
A Tai is on the other side.

258
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Why do you use the sea house

259
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,060
that you haven't used in years?

260
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
I'm too good at it.

261
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,660
I was wrong.

262
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,260
You are so selfish.

263
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
You choose the light,

264
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,860
you choose the magic,

265
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
you don't have brains.

266
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
Choose the light.

267
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,060
I will choose the light.

268
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,860
Choose the light.

269
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,660
From what I've said,

270
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,260
until now,

271
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,860
we have 7 soldiers in total.

272
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,460
You have 15 soldiers in 28 soldiers.

273
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,860
If I were your teammate, I'd be out of my mind.

274
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,060
Don't say it.

275
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,860
My soldiers.

276
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,060
Now we have 16 soldiers.

277
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,460
If you don't have the soldiers,

278
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,460
you can leave the village.

279
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,260
Why are you so worried?

280
00:13:43,660 --> 00:14:01,760
You clearly don't understand how sher

281
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,060
They蛕20 years of guard mess.

282
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,400
But they are two清

283
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,160
ordinary shopping malls.

284
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,960
How could a Lieutenant

285
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,460
drift off when he 他</i lectead arrive alone?

286
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,540
HEY, obsessed player,

287
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,660
A Tai, What's wrong with you?

288
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,060
Were you shot by a person,

289
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,020
Don't be so serious.

290
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,220
I'm about to take off.

291
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,180
How dare you do this to us?

292
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,260
I'm the best.

293
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,100
Sixth.

294
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,820
Look at your first act.

295
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,740
You're looking at your pig's eye

296
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,420
and looking at the other side.

297
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,460
Where is it?

298
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,020
Lu Si Cheng, you're sick.

299
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,060
Why are you scaring me?

300
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,260
I want to see you

301
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,460
shaking in bed.

302
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,060
You don't even dare to say a word.

303
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,860
Cheers.

304
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,060
What are you talking about?

305
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
No.

306
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,260
I didn't.

307
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,060
How is that possible?

308
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,260
You believe in such things?

309
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,660
I'll turn off the live broadcast

310
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
if you continue to ask.

311
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,460
I'm going to turn off my stupid house.

312
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,460
This little wife of Lu Si Cheng,

313
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,260
the ID,

314
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm sure she's your idol.

315
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,660
I don't have a computer.

316
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,860
But as for her stupidity,

317
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,260
I don't know.

318
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,060
Anyway, I'm not a good girl.

319
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,260
I'm not a good girl.

320
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,660
Anyway, I don't have a computer.

321
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,460
You can do it yourself.

322
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,860
How can I have a computer?

323
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,060
My legs are not long.

324
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,060
How can I be able to work on them?

325
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,260
I'll give you a bag of powder.

326
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,460
I'll take it for ten thousand years.

327
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,660
Morning.

328
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Morning.

329
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,860
You're boring.

330
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,660
Start training.

331
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,460
You said that guy...

332
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
What's wrong with him?

333
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,460
I'm a close opponent of the jungle.

334
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,260
I can't fight with the middle.

335
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,660
I like it so much.

336
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,460
Why did I break up with him?

337
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,660
Now he's gone to ZGDX.

338
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,860
He's sitting next to Lu Si Cheng.

339
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,660
Isn't that a dirty mouth?

340
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,260
I like Lu Si Cheng

341
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,860
if I'm your idol.

342
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,060
If you're my idol, who doesn't like you?

343
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,860
You?

344
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,260
I like you.

345
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,060
You can't say that.

346
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,060
Last time, when ZGDX was being beat up,

347
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,060
it wasn't a good result.

348
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,060
His performance was good.

349
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,260
At least he could beat K55.

350
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,260
If the two of us don't match,

351
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,860
the jungle will be in the middle of the jungle.

352
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,660
The team is about to end.

353
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,860
Can you train?

354
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,860
Let him go.

355
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,260
Then hurry and come down.

356
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,260
I was so excited yesterday that he came to the victory.

357
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,660
He didn't participate in the competition and came back.

358
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,660
He's not alive and he's lying on my bed.

359
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,660
Can I leave him alone?

360
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660
He's dead and he's out of the game.

361
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
He's going to play the competition tomorrow.

362
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,260
Lu Yue.

363
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,060
Lu Yue is useless.

364
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
What are you thinking about?

365
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,460
So, Brother Cheng, do you have a girlfriend?

366
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
You're so young.

367
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,660
You know how to play games with your face.

368
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,860
You don't like the appearance of a human.

369
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,460
Aren't you anxious?

370
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,260
What's wrong with this little guy?

371
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,460
He's your girlfriend.

372
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
How do you know?

373
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,060
He said he doesn't like human and is too familiar with him.

374
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,260
Who wants you to really look like

375
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,260
and don't like human?

376
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,060
Stop talking nonsense.

377
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,860
I can't find a wife in the future.

378
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,460
Who's the woman?

379
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,860
I'm so annoyed.

380
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,460
Don't be so serious.

381
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,060
Let's review each other.

382
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,060
I don't know about it.

383
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,660
Bastard!

384
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
You're making us звAZU!!!

385
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,060
Wen electrolytic transpute landed on Father prophet Ya 对了!

386
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
Won used for high blood pressure,

informaciónり知识基因可贼了.

388
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,580
What now?

389
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,440
My daily concern

390
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,940
and the health issues

391
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,660
are not available to anyone

392
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,800
in this man-in-law Sect.

393
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,420
Is that a mistake?

394
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,460
What's that?

395
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,480
replaced by another千

396
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,300
the pair involves

397
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,880
the first pair

398
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,140
is not in place yet.

399
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,340
What the hell are you saying?

400
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,040
The man-in-law isN need this Koh LOUT

401
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,640
Brother inducted us on our母組.

402
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
Sister petals that we need

403
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,440
keep them.

404
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,520
Brother'stes only for our own safety

405
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,860
Black and white

406
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,280
consideration

407
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,860
is important.

408
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,060
Hello, which one?

409
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,780
Hello?

410
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,060
Strange.

411
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,460
Why didn't you talk?

412
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,860
I just hung up.

413
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,620
The patient is in the hospital.

414
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,340
Did you see it?

415
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,380
Lu Si Cheng, stop talking.

416
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,340
My patient...

417
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,700
Hello, Yao Yao.

418
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,540
It's me.

419
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,180
Hello?

420
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,420
I'm at your clinic.

421
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,780
Can you come out?

422
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,300
What clinic?

423
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,460
I'll go in if you don't mind.

424
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,900
Why are you here suddenly?

425
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,020
Wait a minute.

426
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,620
Lu Yue, come over here and finish the call.

427
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,780
I have something to do.

428
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:34,900
Okay.

429
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,020
Who is it?

430
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,700
Jian Yang.

431
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,020
Why did he come here?

432
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,380
How do I know?

433
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,620
The weather is hot,ank it.

434
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,020
Jiangangan.

435
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,900
I think

436
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,740
it's an excuse for your bed.

437
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,460
Leave it.

438
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,100
I'll walk in and end up in your bed.

439
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,260
I can't stand it, Vale.

440
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,020
In the future,

441
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,160
our Punchella and ZGDX

442
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,580
will play a race

443
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,140
and then fight together.

444
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,840
We can do it .

445
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,420
Shut your mouth.

446
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,220
Thank you.

447
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,340
No need.

448
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,220
Your girlfriend is coming to pick you up, right?

449
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,860
It's dark.

450
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,700
You go in first.

451
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,980
Don't let her go too far.

452
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,900
Thank you.

453
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,980
I don't know what's going on.

454
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,100
Tong Yao is not here.

455
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,620
I...

456
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,300
Tong Yao!

457
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,900
Ai Jia!

458
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,420
Why are you here?

459
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,820
Waiting for you.

460
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,860
I just want to remind you.

461
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,580
As the saying goes,

462
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,220
good is good, bad is bad, bad is bad.

463
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,100
A man can't be a good man.

464
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,860
Someone said that

465
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,380
he's not in a relationship with a professional player.

466
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,100
Okay, okay. I got it.

467
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,500
It's not good.

468
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,540
What's so good about it?

469
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,740
But he's drunk.

470
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,300
I have to get him back.

471
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,580
Otherwise,

472
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,620
CK and Da Yan will die on the way to ZZDX.

473
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,460
It's not good to be out of this.

474
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,020
Fine.

475
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,620
Do you want to go with Ai Jia?

476
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,060
None of my business.

477
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,940
I'm not going.

478
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,420
What's the point of you?

479
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,780
My friend.

480
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,060
Honey.

481
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,860
I'll post it later.

482
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,500
It's interesting.

483
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,460
What are you doing here?

484
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,580
Jiang, what are you doing?

485
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,260
I...

486
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,180
I'm going to kill you, Da Yan.

487
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,740
You...

488
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,620
Let go of me.

489
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,060
Lower your voice.

490
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,380
I'll tell you when I get home.

491
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,820
You're drunk.

492
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,380
Are you really in a relationship with Lu Si Cheng?

493
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,860
What do you mean?

494
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,500
Didn't he explain everything in the live?

495
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,620
Is it because of this

496
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,620
that you've been through half of the town?

497
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,900
If you're here to gossip,

498
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,340
you can leave now.

499
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,340
Take care.

500
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,620
Why did he say

501
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,020
the words of Xia Mei in the live?

502
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,740
Now the whole group is talking about you.

503
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,620
What?

504
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,820
You're together.

505
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,460
Every time I see these,

506
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,380
I'm going crazy.

507
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,820
That's a joke.

508
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,940
Besides,

509
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,140
it's none of your business.

510
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,940
Jiang Yang.

511
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,660
I think

512
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,460
I've told you clearly before.

513
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
What did you say?

514
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,500
Our faces.

515
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,420
Forget it.

516
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:38,940
Really.

517
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,220
Didn't you have a good time?

518
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
You hit your job,

519
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,460
I went to my school.

520
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,340
We didn't have a drink.

521
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,660
Why did you come to the gym

522
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,780
after hitting my job?

523
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,380
I didn't come to the gym.

524
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,980
Then you have to give me

525
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,100
an explanation.

526
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,860
Well,

527
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,660
I was wrong about you.

528
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,180
I was afraid you'd think too much

529
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,220
so I didn't dare to tell you.

530
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,260
I really did nothing.

531
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,980
I went back directly after I drank.

532
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,820
If you don't believe me,

533
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,060
you can ask Hao Yan to come to them.

534
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,140
Why should I ask them?

535
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,380
Besides,

536
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,740
the general situation

537
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,060
doesn't always depend on respect to time.

538
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,020
Thank god.

539
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,140
We will나� at aberide.

540
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,840
A change in ourios

541
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,020
is beyond our inflammation.

542
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,020
Isn't it all a mix of altruism?

543
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,180
It's not a lie in TV shows.

544
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,220
There's another way to make the deal

545
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,240
when I drink a cold bouquet.

546
00:23:37,740 --> 00:24:04,580
a

547
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,540
I bought sugar.

548
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,100
You're a doctor.

549
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,020
Buy it.

550
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:18,940
Yao Yao.

551
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,700
Da Zhuang.

552
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,340
Tong Yang.

553
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,580
My name is Tong Yang.

554
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,100
Tong Yang.

555
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,700
Give me another chance, okay?

556
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,420
I really didn't hurt you.

557
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,980
You didn't work hard before.

558
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,780
You don't know.

559
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,420
Now you're in this industry.

560
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,820
You should know how hard it is.

561
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,540
Life is exposed on the bottom of the media and the fans.

562
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,700
It's really hard to protect the people you like.

563
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,500
I didn't want to expose you to the fans.

564
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,180
I was afraid they would hurt you.

565
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,340
Yao Yao.

566
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,660
I miss you.

567
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,940
I miss you so much.

568
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,620
I wish I could have a day of my dream.

569
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,380
We can go to the finals together.

570
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,980
You should be watching me from the bottom of the stage.

571
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,620
When I met that Jiang Bei,

572
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,020
I would propose to you.

573
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,340
Jian Yang.

574
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,620
Don't you understand?

575
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,180
I can do it myself now.

576
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,900
Brother Cheng.

577
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,060
Buy sugar.

578
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:14,900
Buy money.

579
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,540
Give it to me first.

580
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,220
I'll give it to you later.

581
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,820
Don't you have to use the payment now?

582
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,540
Yao Yao.

583
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,180
Here you are.

584
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,900
By the way,

585
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,780
you said you wanted to play the piano.

586
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,500
But I think I need to make some sense.

587
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,260
First,

588
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,580
I'm sure I'll be there in the finals.

589
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,460
But,

590
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,900
he's playing the game by himself.

591
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,660
I guess he's not in the competition.

592
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,700
He's watching you two.

593
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,340
Second,

594
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,060
this year's award has been named ZJDX.

595
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,300
I'll choose the fox.

596
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:48,900
Thank you.

597
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,740
I'm done.

598
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,500
You can go on.

599
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,580
So what do you want to say to me?

600
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,980
If I didn't play the piano in the beginning,

601
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,860
we'd be together forever.

602
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,140
Jian Yang,

603
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,740
don't you understand?

604
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,700
It's not because you play the piano

605
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,860
that we're in the middle of a relationship.

606
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,660
It's because I'm the one.

607
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,900
From the beginning,

608
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,580
you didn't think of me as

609
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,900
someone who can be with you

610
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,940
in the same position

611
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,620
or someone who can be with you.

612
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
You have your dream.

613
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,700
I have my goal,

614
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,940
which I can't achieve.

615
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,100
I can't lose my will.

616
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,980
So, Jian Yang,

617
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,740
we're not suitable for each other.

618
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,620
We're not suitable for each other?

619
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,140
Isn't it good to have a relationship?

620
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,740
Jian Yang,

621
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,300
let's do this today.

622
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,460
You drank too much.

623
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,620
I'll send you back to the base.

624
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,900
It's not good for you to see your fans like this.

625
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,620
Let's go.

626
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
What do we count now?

627
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,460
Friends.

628
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,900
If we're still friends,

629
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
let me go first.

630
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,580
What?

631
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,660
Blacklist.

632
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,180
All right.

633
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,180
But if you still want to say weird things,

634
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,580
I still want to put you in the blacklist.

635
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,900
What weird things?

636
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,740
What kind of proposal

637
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,340
that looks like you're hot.

638
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:24,940
All right.

639
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,580
Since we're friends,

640
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,300
let's hug for the last time.

641
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,900
It's only you in the whole world

642
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,220
know that I'm a lie.

643
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,600
We don't have

644
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,220
both.

645
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,100
He Ming Da also came out.

646
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,620
Come on, I'll take you back.

647
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,100
To succeed in some situation

648
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,420
Don't break this rule

649
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,220
to be the most righteous person.

650
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,100
aro

651
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,360
Have you been carsick!

652
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,520
Let's go home

653
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,880
I'm leaving now

654
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,780
We are not good at singing

655
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:19,940
We are not good at singing

656
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:19,980
We are not good at singing

657
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,020
We are not good at singing

658
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,060
We are not good at singing

659
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,100
We are not good at singing

660
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,140
We are not good at singing

661
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,180
We are not good at singing

662
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,220
We are not good at singing

663
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,260
We are not good at singing

664
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,300
We are not good at singing

665
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,340
We are not good at singing

666
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:20,380
We are not good at singing

667
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:20,420
We are not good at singing

668
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:20,460
We are not good at singing

669
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:20,500
We are not good at singing

670
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:20,620
We are not good at singing

671
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:20,660
We are not good at singing

672
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:20,700
We are not good at singing

673
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:20,740
We are not good at singing

674
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:20,780
We are not good at singing

675
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:20,820
We are not good at singing

676
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:20,900
We are not good at singing

677
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:20,940
We are not good at singing

678
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,020
We are not good at singing

679
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,060
We are not good at singing

680
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,140
We are not good at singing

681
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,180
We are not good at singing

682
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,780
The most regretful love is us

683
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,220
Hello

684
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,220
Hello

685
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,340
We just moved here

686
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,220
Just sitting opposite

687
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
Hello

688
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,180
Sorry

689
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,020
I have been disturbing you for two months

690
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,020
It's okay

691
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,060
We can understand

692
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,820
What is your name?

693
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,100
My name is Yangyang

694
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,660
Yangyang, thank you

695
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,100
Thank you

696
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,720
My name is dad

697
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,400
My name is Chairman

698
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,900
Dad

699
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
I'm also your dad

700
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,800
My name is Haven

701
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
I won't go back to school

702
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,620
Have to work hard back there

703
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Let's enjoy it.

704
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,440
Everyone.

705
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,880
Let's enjoy.

706
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,100
If you want ice water.

707
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,540
anyways…

708
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,860
It's been a while.

709
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,320
Monster Boy.

710
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,840
Just like I asked you for ice.

711
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,860
Don't think it's necessary.

712
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,760
And the two of you.

713
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,680
Give him back.

714
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,760
That's life.

715
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,100
Xiao Meng,

716
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,460
you're not cream.

717
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,900
As long as you love her,

718
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,580
please allow her to follow you.

719
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,540
Chen,

720
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,940
had you made a deal with her?

721
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,500
No.

722
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,100
Then why did she hug you?

723
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,820
Why did you watch her?

724
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,220
Young lady's sixth sense.

725
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,820
You're so shameless.

726
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,820
You still have the sixth sense.

727
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,420
Then take your wallet out and have a look.

728
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,020
What are you looking at?

729
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,820
Who gave you the courage?

730
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
Liang Jingwu.

731
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,420
You're shameless.

732
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,620
Why are you two back together?

733
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,420
Where's your lamb?

734
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,620
Are you feeling better?

735
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,620
Or do you think that

736
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,020
you're with my brother?

737
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,820
I met you when I was a kid.

738
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
I went to Jianyang.

739
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
I was with a good guy.

740
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,420
And I was with your brother.

741
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,420
I wanted to live longer.

742
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,820
So I won't be in love with a pro-dance player.

743
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,020
Girls can't be gentle.

744
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,820
No.

745
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,420
You're not in love with anyone.

746
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,220
Wait.

747
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,420
Lu Yue.

748
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,420
You bastard.

749
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,620
Don't steal my number.

750
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,820
You asked me to hit you.

751
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,220
I didn't ask you to hit me like this.

752
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
How can you break the plate?

753
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,820
It's fine.

754
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,220
I'm going to fly away.

755
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,020
No way.

756
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,220
You're so noisy.

757
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,220
Why don't you eat the candy you bought?

758
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
You suddenly don't want to eat it.

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,980
and then let her go.

787
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,860
You're so kind.

I've got this news today.

795
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
I've got Brother Cheng's special attention.

796
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,940
It doesn't exist.

00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,340
Then explain

00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,900
with his insomnia.

801
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,660
Even if it's just a joke,

802
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,340
it's just...

803
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,140

he always talks nonsense.

810
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,660
Then how do you explain

811
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,420
that he's going to stop you and Jian Anhe?

812
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,380
I don't want to

813
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,500
be distracted by things like love.

814
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,060
It's said that

815
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,820
there seems to be no girlfriend

816
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,420
in our team.

817
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,980
I've got a bad smell

818
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,300

819
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,260
Do you really think that

820
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,500
Lu Si Cheng did this

821
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,860
just to get the result?

822
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,860
That's enough, sister.

823
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,340
Don't make me think too much.

824
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,540

He's good at adding gold.

830
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,700
If he likes me,

831
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,020
he might be scared by me.

832
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,860
You're really good.

833
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,180
Why are you so self-sufficient?

834
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,980
How do I think

That's not to be disturbed.

Mao's father is a smart guy.

842
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,060
You're right.

843
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,340

Okay, stop talking.

Okay, good night.

How is Lu Si Cheng?

855
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,380
He's still at my age.

856
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,500
You think Lu Si Cheng does this

857
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,860
