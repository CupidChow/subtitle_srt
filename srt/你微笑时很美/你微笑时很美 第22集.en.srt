then Liang Sheng's Ebisu went in to stun.

Hurry up.

91

After Pope joined YQCB,

92
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,370
he has changed the team's playstyle.

Look, they're about to push the base!

107

They hit the base!

108
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,190
It'll be a one-push!

109
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,110
One push, one push!

110
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,909
It's really a one-push!

111

Brilliant, brilliant.

118
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,840
This push was really awesome.

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,260
YQCB's really charging forward

120
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,240
with great momentum this season.

121
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,380
Yes, it seems that in just a few months,

122
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,660
they already have great chemistry.

123
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,950
Not only has Pope found a suitable support,

124
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,750
but even mid-laner Ai Jia's playstyle

125
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,110
is also changing.

126

Yes.

127
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,330
Ai Jia really dominated this entire round.

128
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,310
The rhythm of this round was spot on.

129

132
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,630
What highlight?

133
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,990
You know that

134
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,230
when I met this kid,

135
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,120
he was still just a little boy.

136
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,430
It's not like I'm with him because...

137
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,290
I'm sorry.

138
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,520
It was an accident.

139
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,570
What are you doing?

140
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,900
Did I do anything wrong?

141
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,820
Some people are just ridiculous.

142
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,570
They don't understand

143
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,120
or know how to play the game,

144
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,770
but got with the player

145
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,950
because he's famous.

146
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,550
Yet they're so smug about it.

147
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,540
Keep it down.

148
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,820
His girlfriend isn't...

149
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,330
I'm not talking about her.

150
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,170
Isn't it because of those people

151
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,840
that female fans are catching flak?

152
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,000
Like that, what's his name, Xu Tailun

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,230
and that Guoguo?

154
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,070
If they like a player,

155
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,330
just be content with watching their matches.

156
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,250
Why must they go and seduce them?

157
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,860
You're right.

158
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,960
We'll talk after the match.

159
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,530
Look at that fool.

160
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,540
He's playing on stage optimistically.

161
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,280
If I were down here arguing with his fans,

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,290
would it be appropriate?

163
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,480
But we can't let them talk about you like that.

164
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,210
It's fine, don't overthink it.

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,030
Let the second round begin.

166
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,210
The current score is 1-0,

167
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,890
with YQCB in the lead.

168
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,590
The ban and pick phase for this round is now complete.

169
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,390
Both teams have confirmed their shikigamis.

170
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,270
We can see that

171
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,030
Alpha picked Ryomen,

172
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,980
Kosode no te,

173
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,150
Higanbana, Youko, and Ebisu.

174
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,300
For this round,

175
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,320
they aren't using the jungle-support roaming strategy?

176
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,160
YQCB has chosen Yamausagi, Tanuki,

177
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,950
and Ibaraki Doji for jungle,

178
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,190
and Ai Jia is using Yuki Onna.

179
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,910
It's clear that

180
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,750
this "Protect the Carry" strategy is for Pope's Hakuro.

181
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,210
They might be trying out a new tactic.

182
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,050
But I think

183
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,310
they're not entirely familiar

184
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,770
with "Protect the Carry".

185
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,750
Besides,

186
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,850
Alpha's jungler is using Kosode no te.

187
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,010
He's no pushover.

188
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,210
Once he figures out the opponent's intention...

189
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,810
The bottom lane will suffer.

190
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,290
Alpha's jungler

191
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,490
can't do much when behind,

192
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,290
but when ahead,

193
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,909
his skills are world-class.

194
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,930
The push is happening quickly.

195
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,820
Look, we can see

196
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,190
Alpha's jungler, Zero,

197
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,500
preparing to gank the bottom lane

198
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,660
as a surprise attack!

199
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,550
That's right, but look,

200
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,500
Ai Jia's Yuki Onna doesn't seem to have noticed!

201
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,060
He hasn't gone to support!

202
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,460
-We can fight!
-Go, go, go!

203
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,690
-Keep up!
-Keep up!

204
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,310
By the current confrontation,

205
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,200
Pope's Hakuro seems to be in danger!

206
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,930
His life is hanging by a thread!

207
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,740
Yes, we can clearly see

208
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,180
YQCB using a "Protect the Carry" strategy.

209
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,310
Pope has been taken out first!

210
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,110
What a huge blow to their morale!

211
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,860
Instead of returning to the jungle,

212
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,299
Kosode no te headed straight for mid lane!

213
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,500
Is he planning to cut off their retreat?

214
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,650
Ai Jia, careful!

215
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,909
Just as I'd predicted!

216
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,150
Quick, look!

217
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,610
Ai Jia was completely caught off guard by this move!

218
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,110
Instead, Xbang came to support

219
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,950
and got caught too!

220
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,630
YQCB's change in strategy

221
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,640
shows zero chemistry!

222
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,010
Ai Jia's play is just painful to watch!

223
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,670
It's like Ai Jia reverted

224
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,670
to his old playstyle!

225
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,410
It's almost the same opening as the last round,

226
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,660
freeing up the support to gank mid together,

227
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,750
catching YQCB's mid-jungle duo.

228
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,910
The next step should be to target top lane

229
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,890
and gank the top laner,

230
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,590
or wait for Octopus to respawn and take it.

231
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,550
Based on the data,

232
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,260
it's more likely that they'd gank the top lane.

233
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,140
Rong Rong's Tanuki is already intercepted

234
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,160
by the enemy jungler

235
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,920
-on the way...
-Chase them!

236
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
to support Ai Jia!

237
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,030
Chase them down!

238
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,980
Five minutes.

239
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,860
Five kills in just five minutes.

240
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,690
Neither of the bottom laners has reached level six.

241
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,090
YQCB's rhythm has gone haywire this round.

242
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,310
It seems that in this season,

243
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,430
"Protect the Carry" isn't quite viable.

244
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,630
But Cheng and Pope

245
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,510
are really cut from the same cloth.

246
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,610
They always charge in for a fight, regardless of the lineup.

247
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,350
But

248
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,630
Pope is a bit more aggressive than Cheng.

249
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,570
Now that Pope's down, they have no way of winning.

250
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,780
How can you deal damage with Yuki Onna in mid lane?

251
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,670
To be honest,

252
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,430
I really don't get

253
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,870
why he chose Yuki Onna.

254
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,350
Any damage-oriented shikigami

255
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,250
would've been better.

256
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,890
Exactly.

257
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,570
Sometimes we really can't

258
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,560
ignore the meta.

259
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,950
If you go for a "Protect the Carry,"

260
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,610
your opponents will have counter-strategies.

261
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,510
Ai Jia's performance

262
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,430
is really off-rhythm this round.

263
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,350
Pope has no room to deal damage at all,

264
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,110
and he's far behind on gold.

265
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,070
We can fight! Go, go!

266
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,870
Come here, protect me.

267
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,770
Protect the damage dealer.

268
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,370
-We can fight.
-We can fight.

269
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,890
-We can fight.
-We can fight.

270
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,110
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

271
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,290
-Chase them!
-Keep up!

272
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,200
They're low on HP!

273
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,420
Retreat. Retreat now.

274
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,740
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

275
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,550
Alpha completely saw through

276
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,100
YQCB's "Protect the Carry."

277
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,390
After the ADC was taken out,

278
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,190
the other members are

279
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,970
like fish on a chopping board, ready to be slaughtered.

280
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,170
They can't keep up with damage output either.

281
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,060
They're totally getting stomped, aren't they?

282
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,820
That's right.

283
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,150
But changing strategies now

284
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,240
might be too late!

285
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,520
After a beautiful team wipe,

286
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Alpha has pushed to the high ground.

287
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,720
Pope has respawned.

288
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,450
But I think it's hopeless.

289
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,660
Hakuro, who didn't get to farm early on,

290
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,860
is utterly helpless!

291
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,870
He died in his own base

292
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,730
without killing a single minion!

293
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,030
It's destroyed!

294
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,220
Congrats to Team Alpha for winning this round!

295
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,050
Congrats to Alpha!

296
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,440
Congrats!

297
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,120
Didn't I tell you we shouldn't play like that?

298
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
It's okay. Next round.

299
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,390
Ai Jia didn't perform well this round.

300
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,160
It's in stark contrast to the previous round.

301
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,040
Your boyfriend lost the round.

302
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,130
What's the big deal? It's just one round.

303
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,030
It's not like I've never seen him lose before.

304
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,050
He barely won during the entire spring season.

305
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,910
And now he can't accept this loss?

306
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,320
It doesn't matter.

307
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,750
It's not over yet.

308
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,570
They can just win the next round.

309
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,410
What are you doing?

310
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,290
What does she mean?

311
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,500
What doesn't matter?

312
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,100
Why shouldn't it matter?

313
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,340
Exactly!

314
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,190
It's because of people like you

315
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,990
that players end up underperforming!

316
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,990
We came all this way

317
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,670
just to watch them win.

318
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,230
Please don't say such

319
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,870
irritating things.

320
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,230
Ai Jia!

321
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,190
Ai Jia!

322
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,860
My friend didn't mean

323
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,670
that...

324
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,390
Let's go.

325
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,670
-What are you doing?
-Let’s go.

326
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,190
Why bother with people like that?

327
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,310
Wait, "people like that"?

328
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,030
I'm your fan, you know.

329
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,390
Yes, you heard right.

330
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,910
I wouldn't ever speak to my own girlfriend like that.

331
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,440
What gives you the right to?

332
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,570
How I play has nothing to do with her.

333
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,770
If you have a problem,

334
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,220
come at me.

335
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,410
Let's go.

336
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,240
So cool!

337
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,030
That's so crazy!

338
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,890
I've never seen anything like it.

339
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
So cool!

340
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,360
Not bad!

341
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,860
Nice, nice.

342
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,300
-So cool!
-He's such a star!

343
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,710
That was so cool!

344
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,790
Put me down.

345
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,190
Are you crazy?

346
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,220
Why did you jump off the stage?

347
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,170
Should I've done nothing?

348
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:06,770
Of course.

349
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,790
For your competition, I can tolerate anything.

350
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,790
Why do you have to?

351
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,430
Listen.

352
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,620
I've been furious for days.

353
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,350
Playing esports is my business.

354
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,610
Dating is my business.

355
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,910
Winning or losing is also my business.

356
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,740
I just can't stand

357
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,030
them slandering you.

358
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,220
If they want to criticize,

359
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,760
they should criticize me too.

360
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,960
I won't indulge them.

361
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,490
Why should my girlfriend,

362
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,050
whom I cherish and protect,

363
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:29,850
be bullied

364
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,580
by those who don't even know us?

365
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,740
Also,

366
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,780
they're doing this in the name

367
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
of protecting me.

368
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,920
Should I tolerate it?

369
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,980
And why should you?

370
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,510
Do we owe them anything?

371
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,840
What right do they have?

372
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,470
Are you a fool?

373
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,090
That chatter's nothing to me.

374
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,690
Silly, how childish are you?

375
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,590
I'm childish?

376
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,890
I've told you before,

377
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,250
as long as I'm with you,

378
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,550
whether it's a sea of flames or a bottomless abyss,

379
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,690
I'll trudge through it even with my eyes closed.

380
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,630
At first,

381
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,700
I didn't understand your esports dream.

382
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,260
But since I came back to China,

383
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,590
from the opening match,

384
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,470
I've watched you fight your way to where you are now.

385
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,540
Though I still don't understand those operations,

386
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,400
like tower breaking or whatever.

387
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,790
It's tower diving.

388
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,150
Whatever it is,

389
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,450
I know that

390
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,270
at least for the first half of your life,

391
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,260
you won't leave the esports stage.

392
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,430
I also know

393
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,920
that you can't live without me for your entire life.

394
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,960
So,

395
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,150
I won't do

396
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,510
anything melodramatic like

397
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,040
forcing you to choose between esports and me.

398
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,390
I've made up my mind,

399
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,030
so I won't regret it.

400
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,050
if I can't handle that minor chatter,

401
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,560
how can I even date you?

402
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,580
Isn't being with people like you

403
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,240
about accepting this attention and criticism?

404
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,710
It's all because my boyfriend is so capable,

405
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,190
a rising star in esports.

406
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,450
Whether they bless us or not,

407
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,710
our future

408
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
has nothing to do with them.

409
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,790
I'm not joking.

410
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,940
Whether it's a sea of flames or a bottomless abyss,

411
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
I will...

412
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,700
It's so tough.

413
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,810
Jinyang does have it tough.

414
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,830
Those haters are at it again.

415
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,750
What's the deal with Ai Jia?

416
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,270
Is he an esports player or a drama actor?

417
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,070
-I know!
-Now I believe...

418
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,600
that girl's family is rich.

419
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,940
Ai Jia must be using his status as an esports player

420
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,070
to latch onto power.

421
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,550
What's on your mind?

422
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,400
Ai Jia didn't do anything.

423
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,690
He just spoke a bit loudly.

424
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,600
Will he be banned from competing

425
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,720
or be punished?

426
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,390
Jinyang didn't do anything either.

427
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,670
She usually can't stand being wronged.

428
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,100
But today, for Ai Jia's competition,

429
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,700
she took it all without retaliation.

430
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,960
What more do they want?

431
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,850
They're just simply dating.

432
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,450
What's with all these reasons

433
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,850
and weird conspiracies?

434
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,020
If you truly like someone,

435
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,700
who cares if they are

436
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,150
an impressive player or star?

437
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,270
It's just pure love, that's all.

438
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,740
Players are human too.

439
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,280
They also have people they like

440
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,010
and people they want to be with.

441
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,830
What's wrong with that?

442
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,430
Or is it that

443
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,710
having such thoughts is wrong in itself?

444
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,040
Because as public figures,

445
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,960
you don't have

446
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,359
complete autonomy.

447
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,829
Players exist

448
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,109
to win competitions,

449
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,310
please fans,

450
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,380
and serve the team.

451
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,750
So you should do anything

452
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,210
to achieve these goals.

453
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,430
These ideas seem right,

454
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,369
and of course, many people agree with them,

455
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,260
but if even the players

456
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,550
think this way,

457
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,100
then it's a disaster.

458
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,820
Yes, winning is important.

459
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,150
But compared to

460
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,150
the fans' appraisal of our results,

461
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,090
we're the ones directly impacted by the results.

462
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,720
So, selfishly speaking,

463
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,960
it is our business.

464
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,540
"Thank you for your love and support,

465
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,110
but the match results

466
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,990
really has nothing to do with you."

467
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,850
This is the right way of thinking.

468
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,630
You're too rational.

469
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,380
But I can't be like that.

470
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,850
I'm easily affected.

471
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,180
I have mental breakdowns

472
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,700
and get upset.

473
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,470
Everyone does.

474
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,250
But you seem immune.

475
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,070
Cheng.

476
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,510
Are you really so invincible that you fear nothing?

477
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,990
Yes.

478
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,140
Because I still need to protect you all.

479
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,540
Forget it.

480
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,760
Let's just hug first.

481
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,580
Why are you making it sound like the world

482
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,700
is about to end?

483
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,880
Tomorrow,

484
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,270
these great pecs and abs

485
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,540
might not be mine anymore.

486
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,940
It is the end of the world.

487
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,640
It's such a pity that they lost this round.

488
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,500
Luckily, they won it back later.

489
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,390
After all this commotion,

490
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,250
what strategy should we use next?

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,790
God Ming.

492
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,060
I have an immature idea.

493
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,110
Why don't we use "Protect the Carry" again?

494
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,310
"Protect the Carry"?

495
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,510
Why?

496
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,170
No particular reason.

497
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,760
It's a very controversial strategy now.

498
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,030
Everyone says

499
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,260
teams that rely on it this season

500
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,290
are bound to lose.

501
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,430
But when we played against DQ Five,

502
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,230
we used it in the second round

503
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,810
and it worked quite well.

504
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,670
So I want to test it again

505
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,770
to see if it works.

506
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,380
Don't they say

507
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,410
application is the sole criterion for testing truth?

508
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,810
You want to use Yuki Onna?

509
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,620
Yuki Onna?

510
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,070
Didn't Ai Jia just use Yuki Onna?

511
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:35,970
And they lost.

512
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,160
Their loss in the last match

513
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,220
wasn't because Ai Jia used Yuki Onna.

514
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,830
The key of the strategy is the ADC.

515
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,930
Tong Yao.

516
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,230
You seem to have an ulterior motive.

517
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,890
You've been rambling on and on

518
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,310
just to

519
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,950
vindicate your good friend,

520
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,400
to prove that their loss

521
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,800
had nothing to do with Ai Jia's girlfriend.

522
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,960
Alright then.

523
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,740
Pope never gets flak.

524
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,110
No matter how he plays,

525
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,840
people will always defend him.

526
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,230
Pope was the biggest reason

527
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,090
their team lost their last match.

528
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,460
Let's show him what

529
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,190
"Protect the Carry" really is.

530
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,550
This will really frustrate him,

531
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,880
which I'm on board with.

532
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,500
So,

533
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,610
I agree.

534
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,200
Okay, okay, sure.

535
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,200
I'll take Ibaraki Doji later.

536
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,140
Let's relive the spring season.

537
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,630
Using outdated shikigamis and tactics

538
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,430
regardless of the current meta.

539
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,950
You guys are really cocky.

540
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,310
How did I end up in such a chaotic team?

541
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,410
Join the chaos too.

542
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,200
Why don't you take Ichimokuren?

543
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,120
Cat is right.

544
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,920
Take Ichimokuren later.

545
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,980
Go support Cat, and I'll solo bottom.

546
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,060
Reliving the spring season, huh?

547
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,740
Let's go.

548
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,120
Relive the spring season.

549
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,680
[2020 OPL National League Group A Round-Robin, Match 8]

550
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,470
Tong Yao.

551
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,770
Are you sure?

552
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,430
Okay, now the ten players on the field

553
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,990
have chosen their shikigamis.

554
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,430
Let's check out the final shikigami lineup.

555
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,300
On ZGDX's side, the top laner Cat

556
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,480
chose Kuroko.

557
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,310
Jungler K chose Ibaraki Doji.

558
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,580
Mid laner Smiling chose Yuki Onna.

559
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,180
ADC Chessman chose Hakuro.

560
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,030
Support Pang chose Ichimokuren.

561
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,350
On Doomsday Orcs' side, the top laner is Shuten Doji,

562
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,430
the jungler is Yoto Hime,

563
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,990
the mid laner is Menreiki,

564
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,900
the bottom laner is Dodomeki, and the support is Higanbana.

565
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,070
Qiu, what's your opinion

566
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,680
on these ten shikigamis?

567
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,270
I think ZGDX seems to be

568
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,110
up to something here today.

569
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,500
Smiling actually chose Yuki Onna?

570
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,950
What's the deal with today's matches?

571
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,670
Well, maybe Smiling

572
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,670
was influenced by YQCB's last game,

573
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,310
thinking, "Didn't you screw up

574
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,710
with Yuki Onna?

575
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,740
Then I'll pick Yuki Onna

576
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,710
to show you how to really play her."

577
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,730
With such a functional mid-lane shikigami,

578
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,990
Smiling's not as good as Ai Jia.

579
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,270
If that's really what she thinks,

580
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,150
she might be getting a bit cocky.

581
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,460
I'm just... I'm just kidding around.

582
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,160
This round, ZGDX is even going for the "Protect the Carry" strategy.

583
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,580
What's wrong with "Protect the Carry"?

584
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,180
Are you asking what's wrong?

585
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:05,920
Didn't you

586
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,350
see YQCB losing after using it

587
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,350
with the Pope?

588
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,580
That was the Pope.

589
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,090
He's on par with Cheng.

590
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,730
All the best, guys.

591
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,680
Alright, let's go!

592
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,920
Don't say I didn't warn you about saying such provocative stuff.

593
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,190
After the match is over,

594
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,190
go check your Weibo

595
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,590
and you'll see what's up.

596
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,070
Okay, let the match begin.

597
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,790
Shikigamis from both sides

598
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,410
have arrived in their respective lanes.

599
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,110
In the mid lane, Yuki Onna will be facing

600
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,210
Menreiki.

601
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,200
Five, let's go to the bottom lane.

602
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,430
Menreiki and Yoto Hime

603
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,990
have started moving down

604
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,540
to join Dodomeki and Higanbana

605
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,470
to face Pang and Chessman...

606
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,170
Wait for me.

607
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,830
-Pang, retreat.
-Okay.

608
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,550
They're trying to trap ZGDX's bot duo

609
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,750
so they can't escape.

610
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,430
Look, Pang and Chessman

611
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,000
can only cower under the tower.

612
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,510
Dive the tower. Don't let them escape.

613
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,870
We can fight.

614
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,810
As expected of Higanbana, going straight in to tank the tower!

615
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,870
These three from Doomsday Orcs

616
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,870
dove the tower and secured the kill!

617
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,480
That was some extraordinary teamwork.

618
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,960
-Nice!
-Brilliant.

619
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,550
Menreiki and Higanbana

620
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,230
unleashed their ult moves at Chessman at the same time!

621
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,270
K's Ibaraki Doji

622
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,750
controlled the incoming Dodomeki!

623
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,280
I can handle it. No problem!

624
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,190
I'm going in, I'm going in.

625
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,180
The enemy jungler is coming!

626
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,270
-Nice!
-That was well done.

627
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,730
-Not bad, bro.
-Very good.

628
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,510
The odds are really not in ZGDX's favor for this round.

629
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,190
If this were me in a regular ranked game,

630
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,730
I might've already given up.

631
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,660
But clearly, ZGDX hasn't given up.

632
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,950
Cat, you go too.

633
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,550
Let's go, we're going too.

634
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,060
Orochi pit!

635
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,940
Is the Orochi pit about to witness a big team-fight?

636
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,180
Come quick.

637
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,830
Menreiki has activated her ult and has been dealing damage.

638
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,260
K and Cat are both low on HP.

639
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,250
Will they engage in this fight?

640
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:55,790
Use your ult!

641
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,720
Shuten Doji has entered the battle!

642
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,150
-Attack him!
-Attack him!

643
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,550
They're going for a push!

644
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,260
The Doomsday Orcs are so well-coordinated in this push!

645
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,870
They've taken out Cat and K!

646
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,110
-Nice!
-That was good!

647
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,590
Not bad, not bad at all.

648
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,370
Pang, Tong Yao, lead the momentum.

649
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,260
Give me time to farm.

650
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,660
Okay.

651
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,140
Pang, follow me.

652
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,800
Here I come.

653
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,270
Smiling... Smiling used her ult,

654
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,630
taking out the low-HP Menreiki and Higanbana!

655
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,490
Fight back! Go!

656
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,530
-Chase them!
-Keep chasing!

657
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,710
Pang speeds up, blinks, and knocks out enemies airborne.

658
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,790
Menreiki and Higanbana are down!

659
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,390
Nice!

660
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,560
ZGDX pulled off a brilliant two-for-none exchange!

661
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,670
So worth it!

662
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,800
This push was so worth it.

663
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,670
So brilliant!

664
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,710
That was really impressive.

665
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,030
Smiling's timing and rhythm

666
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,790
just now was excellent.

667
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,600
And Pang was very in sync.

668
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
You can clearly see

669
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400
Yuki Onna is still a viable shikigami.

670
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,080
We can see that

671
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,670
Chessman's really seizing this opportunity well.

672
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,540
He's already frantically farming.

673
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,230
Yes, that's right.

674
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,270
Why? Because Chessman

675
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,650
is the "carry" in ZGDX's "Protect the Carry" strategy,

676
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,000
the core damage dealer.

677
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,580
As they're behind on gold,

678
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,030
he can only let Smiling lead

679
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,970
in small skirmishes

680
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,690
to ensure his farming time.

681
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,510
But Doomsday Orcs has noticed this.

682
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,150
We can fight!

683
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,870
I'll flank them.

684
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,030
I'll go to the bottom.

685
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,510
Yoto Hime has taken position!

686
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,640
Chessman's Hakuro is in danger again!

687
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,850
Yoto Hime used her mobility skill to attack Hakuro!

688
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,410
Chessman quickly reacted and dodged!

689
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,990
Yes, he turned back and attacked!

690
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,740
Chessman's operations are so ferocious!

691
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,700
Counter-kill!

692
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,940
What's with Chessman?

693
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,030
He actually managed to solo kill Yoto Hime with Hakuro!

694
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,070
That was amazing!

695
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,760
-Cool!
-Cheng's showing off!

696
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,870
Now we see the Doomsday Orcs

697
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,150
teleporting to the Orochi pit.

698
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,530
Looks like they want to stabilize their gold first.

699
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,930
The mid laner is missing.

700
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,410
The top duo is also missing.

701
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,900
Trying to get Orochi to get rich?

702
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,280
Cheng, shall we ambush them?

703
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,430
Okay, go set up the ambush.

704
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,430
-Okay.
-Let's go.

705
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,790
Over here,

706
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,390
Doomsday Orcs are already fighting Orochi.

707
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,190
We can fight.

708
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,650
ZGDX is also rushing over,

709
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,620
preparing to ambush near the Orochi pit.

710
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,310
Are they planning to steal the gold?

711
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,270
I'm in position.

712
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,160
Me too.

713
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,730
My skills are off cooldown.

714
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,580
Chessman's still clearing minions in mid?

715
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,720
What about this team-fight?

716
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,320
They don't want this Orochi?

717
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,590
Chessman is still in mid?

718
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,430
Cheng, if you don't come now, we'll lose the Orochi.

719
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,670
Giving up this Orochi

720
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,630
is basically handing this victory to the opponent

721
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,770
on a silver platter!

722
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,190
Cheng, we're out of time.

723
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,430
Cheng, get over here!

724
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,630
This determines if we can turn the tables.

725
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,790
Cheng, come now!

726
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,150
Wait a bit longer.

727
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,780
There's still time.

728
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,040
Orochi's HP is critically low,

729
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,570
but Chessman's still in mid.

730
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,970
W-What is he waiting for?

731
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,480
At this point, Doomsday Orcs' far ahead on gold.

732
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,790
If they take down this Orochi,

733
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,640
once the minion waves arrive,

734
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,970
it'll be tough for ZGDX to make a comeback.

735
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,210
-Cheng!
-Come now!

736
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,020
Wait, I'll reach max level in three seconds.

737
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,030
What was that?

738
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,790
Chessman's Hakuro is almost at max level!

739
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,750
Then they might have a chance at this Orochi pit.

740
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,630
The shikigami Hakuro

741
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,630
has a very long attack range at level 18,

742
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,170
and its high burst damage makes it hard to catch.

743
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,970
They might turn the tables soon.

744
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,840
Three.

745
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,390
Just one more minion!

746
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,530
Just one more minion!

747
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,260
-Can he make it?
-Can he make it?

748
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,020
Two.

749
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,510
One!

750
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,980
Initiate! Go!

751
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,830
-Watch my position.
-Okay.

752
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,230
-Go!
-K, get ready for suppression.

753
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,230
Pang, charge in with me.

754
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,290
-I'm here!
-Tong Yao, use your ult!
-Let's wait and see.

755
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,460
Cheng, I'll shield you. Go!

756
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,200
Careful, Cheng.

757
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,390
I'm here.

758
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,700
It's destroyed!

759
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,320
Congrats to ZGDX for winning this match!

760
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,430
-Nice!
-Yeah!

761
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,960
Congrats to ZGDX for successfully turning the tables!

762
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,830
Yes.

763
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,150
So in this match,

764
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,900
Chessman successfully utilized Hakuro

765
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,550
to its fullest potential, showcasing its terrifying burst damage

766
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,310
near the end of the game,

767
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
and leading ZGDX to victory.

768
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,030
Of course, Smiling also shone

769
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,080
in this round.

770
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,410
She proved that her Yuki Onna

771
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,590
is viable for competitive play.

772
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,390
So, who says

773
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,870
we must blindly follow the meta, right?

774
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,510
Listen.

775
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,350
"Protect the Carry"

776
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,730
is still valid!

777
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,190
[Onmyoji Arena]

778
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,160
First, congrats to Team ZGDX for maintaining

779
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,230
their undefeated streak.

780
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,080
Thank you.

781
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,000
We're also very surprised that Team YQCB

782
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,390
hasn't left the venue after the match ended,

783
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,990
joining us in this special

784
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,680
post-match group interview.

785
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,250
We wanted to leave,

786
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,070
but the coach wouldn't let us.

787
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,990
He kept us in the lounge,

788
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,240
insisting that we watch them play "Protect the Carry."

789
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,160
Because it's a newly attempted strategy,

790
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,900
we're not very familiar with it.

791
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,410
Hello, I've a question for Team ZGDX.

792
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,550
"Protect the Carry"

793
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,750
isn't that suitable in the current meta

794
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,230
where the bot lane is weak.

795
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,020
So why did you

796
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,070
insist on using it

797
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,610
when YQCB failed with it?

798
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,380
Our mid laner said

799
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,770
she also wanted to try the strategy

800
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,830
with Yuki Onna.

801
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,150
I thought it sounded fine.

802
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,510
It was a good chance

803
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,640
to teach other ADCs how to play it well.

804
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,400
So we played two rounds with it.

805
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,230
Okay, thank you.

806
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,630
He said he wanted to teach you how to play it.

807
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,830
I've a question for YQCB.

808
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,630
After the second round today,

809
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,900
there was a small incident.

810
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,920
In the third round,

811
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,700
Ai Jia didn't appear in the starting lineup.

812
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,230
May I ask if you were suspended?

813
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,830
The fans really want to know.

814
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,170
Actually, it's like this.

815
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,150
Letting a sub play in the third round

816
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,470
was a decision made jointly

817
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,350
by the coaching staff and team members.

818
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,950
I know

819
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,260
there are many people online stirring up trouble,

820
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,320
saying Ai Jia was being a diva by refusing to play.

821
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,580
That's not true at all.

822
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,520
Please stop with these rumors.

823
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,670
Actually, at that time,

824
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,050
Ai Jia wasn't in a good mood.

825
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,580
So we thought it'd be better

826
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,830
for a sub to go on.

827
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,070
That's why.

828
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,790
May I ask

829
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,830
why he wasn't in a good mood?

830
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,820
Didn't you see what happened?

831
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,350
Ai Jia.

832
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,120
Enough.

833
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,460
Recently,

834
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,470
there've been

835
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,440
constant rumors

836
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,300
about players' personal lives.

837
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,710
As professional players,

838
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,240
what are your views on this?

839
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,670
Just let nature take its course.

840
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,400
We don't think much about that.

841
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,470
We spend most of our time training.

842
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,970
We rarely have time to interact with others outside.

843
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,450
So most of us are still single.

844
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,720
Hey, hey.

845
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,060
This doesn't mean we've sworn off love.

846
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,659
It's not that we can't find someone,

847
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,330
but it's also not that we don't want to.

848
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,719
It's not that we can't find someone either.

849
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,630
Anyway, you need to understand what's going on here.

850
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,630
But many fans still hope that players

851
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,949
can focus on matches

852
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,590
and strive to win the world championship,

853
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,070
instead of thinking about other stuff.

854
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,989
Like when streaming qualifiers for practice,

855
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,320
just look at match info.

856
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,670
During qualifiers,

857
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,699
don't play other strange games.

858
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,060
Aren't there many

859
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,320
online forums discussing these things?

860
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,120
Fans hope you can play seriously,

861
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,340
win the world championship,

862
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,940
and strive for good results.

863
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,510
Let me repeat what you just said.

864
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,239
See if it's reasonable.

865
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,230
Don't stir up trouble.

866
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,930
Many parents

867
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,930
hope their children can study hard,

868
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,140
strive to ace exams,

869
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,600
and get top universities,

870
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,420
so they shouldn't think about other stuff.

871
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,410
It's like how they always hope

872
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,160
that during breaks between classes,

873
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,030
you'd memorize more English words

874
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,750
instead of playing

875
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,610
those so-called strange games.

876
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,410
Parents often discuss this topic.

877
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,550
But their intention

878
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,410
is also so that you can focus on studying,

879
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,490
achieve good results,

880
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,820
and live your life well.

881
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,990
This sounds quite reasonable.

882
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,580
But usually,

883
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,140
the fans who make such suggestions

884
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,600
are mostly around this age

885
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,330
or are working adults.

886
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,770
Yet they demand

887
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,570
professional players, fellow humans, to do this.

888
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,450
I won't even mention those

889
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,950
who constantly mock players for wasting time

890
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,120
on dating,

891
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,640
or playing other games during their off time.

892
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,380
Don't you ever check your phones

893
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,280
during class or work

894
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,080
to browse forums and waste time?

895
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,350
I just hope

896
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,380
everyone can put themselves in our shoes.

897
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,540
We're all young.

898
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,040
Who hasn't been distracted in class,

899
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,690
fallen asleep during class,

900
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,610
or peeked at the class beauty?

901
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,910
I don't have similar experiences,

902
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,720
but I want to ask, how are pro players any different?

903
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,350
Why should they be flawless like saints?

904
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,160
Nobody's perfect.

905
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,030
People fussing about players

906
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,290
playing Tetris today,

907
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,710
playing Snake tomorrow,

908
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,430
and dating the day after

909
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,650
is really pointless.

910
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,590
We spend most of our time training.

911
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,110
In fact, our training hours

912
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,770
are even longer than some people's study hours.

913
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,150
Many people in school break up

914
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,150
because of

915
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,100
distance or graduation.

916
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,030
But for us pro players,

917
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,470
we get dumped mid-game.

918
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,050
Why?

919
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,830
Who do you think Cheng is talking about?

920
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,880
Why is that?

921
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,430
I suggest you interview

922
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,180
God Yang, the jungler from Team CK.

923
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,710
He'll tell you why.

924
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,210
He's talking about Tong Yao's ex.

925
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:58,930
Cheng.

926
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,560
You seem to have a lot of insights on this.

927
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,350
I'm not

928
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,100
considered young in this circle.

929
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,810
I've been a pro player for years

930
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,210
and have seen quite a lot.

931
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,040
So, in that case,

932
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,670
you don't actually oppose

933
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,790
players dating?

934
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,220
If it's within

935
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,780
reasonable limits.

936
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,630
Haven't we all

937
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,260
heard of people acing their exams

938
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,220
because of love?

939
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,250
Cheng, do you want that too?

940
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,550
I already have someone I like.

941
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,950
Who does Cheng like?

942
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,040
Cheng has someone he likes too?

943
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,270
This is big news!

944
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,110
What a scoop!

945
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,050
He has someone he likes?

946
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,810
Oh my god!

947
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,370
He has someone he likes!

948
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,120
He didn't say anything.

949
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,360
You didn't hear anything.

950
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,680
Don't blush. Relax.

951
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,070
Don't breathe heavily.

952
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,830
Stay calm. Stay calm!

953
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,180
To fans with overly high expectations,

954
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,920
do you have anything to say?

955
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,970
I'm very grateful for your support and love.

956
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,380
I'll work hard in future matches.

957
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
If possible,

958
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,520
please come often to support us in person.

959
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,370
And I want to say,

960
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,030
if you're a true fan of a pro player,

961
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,170
stay close to his game stage,

962
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,180
but keep a distance from his personal life.

963
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,830
Thank you.

964
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,670
You realized your mistakes, right?

965
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,430
When you're free, I'll teach you.

966
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,870
Gosh, enough already.

967
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
Shorty, let's go.

968
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,300
Let go.

969
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:50,790
Come on.

970
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,640
If it weren't for my brilliant performance

971
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,810
with the "Protect the Carry" strategy in these two rounds,

972
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,940
Ai Jia wouldn't have cleared his name.

973
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,550
How will you thank me?

974
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,120
I'll kowtow to you.

975
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,950
No, don't brush me off again.

976
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,650
I'm not.

977
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,510
You are.

978
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,480
Because I want to protect you all.

979
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,150
Someone once said

980
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,500
that the meaning of love is probably

981
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,260
that there's suddenly a person in the world

982
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,140
who can give you everything you want.

983
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,750
He does everything within his power,

984
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,800
fearless,

985
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,470
ready to act without hesitation anytime, anywhere.
