For what?

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,620
Maybe all creatures

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,800
They even don't know how to createellen twelve satire.

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Who said that the game is all fake?

26

Sometimes, he is more mature than you.

00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Don't let yourself be recognized.

What are you thinking about?

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
You are here to play games, not to be in love.

35
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
You said that you don't date a typical player.

36
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800

Don't be affected by the Yangtze.

56

You can go back to the platform.

Don't be affected by the Yangtze.

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Don't be affected by the Yangtze.

65
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,740
Defeat Mumu

66
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,100
A fui eyelid

67
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,260
Such a strict battle

68
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,780
__

69
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,040
to take Assassin

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,940
to explore

71
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,780
the skill of genius

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,640
She lived up to 3 to 5 years

73
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,160
She has a full strength

74
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,660

75
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,620
can reach any。

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
How quasimaxes are working.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Tong Yao, what are you doing?

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,400
You're writing.

79
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,760
You've already written

80
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,840
all the tactics

81
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,400
of DX's fighters.

82
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,260
You can't be good

83
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,160
if you're getting in this number.

84
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,360
See.

85
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
I think you can do it.

86
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,960
Everyone had to learn from you.

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,480
It's good that

88
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,120
these things

89
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,760
could have been made by maththinker.

90
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,640
But you just started

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,440
because you've entered the playing professional competitions.

92
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
As well, we don't needyeon즈 team

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,480
For the Ubuck아빠 anyway

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,560
Let's played bushes

95
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,680

Are you worried?

106
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Let's leave now.

107
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,840

Mr. Da!

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm done working.

111
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,120
Begin.

112
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,720
Okay.

113
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
One second.

114
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,600
I don't even remember whether this is enough or not.

115
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Two minutes.

116
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,400
Wait a second.

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,280
We'll take everything today.

118
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,480
If this looks too familiar

119
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,880
to you

120
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Mr. Chu.

121
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,960
You think it's a real competition?

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,760
You said it's a kind of avow helping to win or receipt of aations.

123
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,400
Yes.

124
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,680
You're so kind.

125
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,820
Why are you both sohearted and start a Tamam.

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Are you not feeling well?

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
A little.

128
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
You're not wearing slippers?

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
How can someone be alive for four or five days?

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Just have breakfast.

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Why are you like a manager?

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
You can wear slippers and eat.

133
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
I'll wait for you outside.

134
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
I'll wait for you outside.

135
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Kid.

136
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Take a look at your teenage diary.

137
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Why do you need to look at her teenage diary?

138
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I need to analyze your data.

139
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Didn't you say that you're not a strong team?

140
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
So you don't need to look at it?

141
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
You wrote it all.

142
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Let me see what's wrong.

143
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Okay.

144
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
What's wrong?

145
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Come and have a look.

146
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
You went to the fourth level in the opening.

147
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Then you went to the other side to talk about the wild boar.

148
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
After the first group of wild boars,

149
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
a lot of opportunities appeared in the middle.

150
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
You can catch them if you catch them.

151
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
If you can't catch them, you can't.

152
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
You can't get them.

153
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
You went back to the middle and then you went back to the city.

154
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
You should have a reaction.

155
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
What's wrong?

156
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Can't you see that I'm telling you to react?

157
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I can't.

158
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
This is a battle analysis.

159
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Why do you always write your own story in the data?

160
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Because he's born with a blood.

161
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Hello, viewers.

162
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,440

The player who is on the screen is the first one to appear.

167
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
The first player on the screen is

168
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
a wild boar from the team of Ping.

169
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Who will be the first one?

170
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
He's a wild boar from the team of Ping.

171
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
The first one to appear is

172
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440

I'm the third one.

179
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I'm the third one.

180
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
I'm the third one.

181
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
The captain of the fighting team,

182
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,960
A Guang,

183
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,440
is the one who is in the top of the list.

184
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
The fighting team

185
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
has entered the national championship

186
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,240
from the first place.

187
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,760
The first one to climb up

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,320
from the exciting championship,

189
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,560
he hopes that the winner

190
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
will be like the one who is dead.

191
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,080
He hopes that the last one will be as strong as the water.

192
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,640
This is the battle of survival.

193
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,240
We will do our best.

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,800
So,

195
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,160
the old people of ZGDX,

196
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
get ready to be stepped on by us.

197
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,120
The battle of survival

198
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,320
is over.

199
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,920
A Guang is really young.

200
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,360
He is young.

201
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,560
But his young spirit

202
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,800
is not the wind of the sky.

203
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
His confidence is quite good.

204
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,320
After all,

205
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,840
he just reached the national championship

206
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,480
and can participate in the professional championship.

207
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
He led the fighting team

208
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,320
to enter the national championship

209
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
from the first place.

210
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,880
He is the best

211
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,280
and the strongest carrier of the team.

212
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,160
He only takes the engine.

213
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,680
Yes.

214
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
The fighting team

215
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,400
is also a great team

216
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
in the final of the A Guang competition.

217
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,560
They led the team to the OPL.

218
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,640
So, I'm looking forward to

219
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,840
the surprise of the ZGDX

220
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,120
for the survival team.

221
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,000
To be honest,

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,360
although...

223
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,520
You want to compete with me?

224
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,600
The battle is not bad.

225
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,320
Tu Yong,

226
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,440
I will choose the big one for you.

227
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,160
Okay.

228
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,600
Okay.

229
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,960
I think it's a bit difficult.

230
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,600
Okay, you can't say that.

231
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,080
Chinese ancient saying

232
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,680
is called

233
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,920
the birth of cow poison.

234
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,080
Wu Haohu.

235
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,560
Let's see.

236
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,200
Let's see.

237
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,080
The two teams are ready.

238
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,680
Let's see the final choice.

239
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,520
Let's see.

240
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,040
Now, the ZGDX

241
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
got the cat from the top

242
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
and the mouse.

243
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,320
The K from the jungle

244
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,520
used the knife.

245
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,840
The Snow Dog from the middle

246
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,160
and the so-called Chaseman

247
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,840
used the white wood ghost.

248
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,320
The little tiger got the wooden face.

249
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,720
Let's look at the King.

250
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,480
The nine-tonne mouse from the top.

251
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,280
The 100,000-year-old mouse from the top.

252
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,960
The white wolf from the middle

253
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,840
and the black mouse from the bottom

254
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,680
are the same.

255
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Don't forget that

256
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,240
the rat from the middle

257
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,120
and the mouse from the top are the same.

258
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,040
Got it.

259
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,240
Come on, everyone.

260
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
So, it depends on you.

261
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,920
Brother Cheng and I will fight.

262
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,520
Okay.

263
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,360
Let's take Brother Cheng to the camp today.

264
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,560
Miss.

265
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Do you want to start the full battle?

266
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,360
Come on, Mr. Shang.

267
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,720
Don't take me with you.

268
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm just a small and clear mid-range

269
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,240
who is matched with the purple red beans

270
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,520
from the other side of the jungle.

271
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
The one who should be purple red beans

272
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,960
is the other side's shadow.

273
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,120
The ten players have chosen

274
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,200
their own God.

275
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,320
So, the ten Gods

276
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,880
will bring you

277
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,680
a test of how to listen to the sound.

278
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,600
We will start the battle right away.

279
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,920
God Ming.

280
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,000
Do you think that

281
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,880
the same tactics are reliable?

282
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,040
I believe in the girl's diary of Smiling.

283
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,640
This side is so strange.

284
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,760
K kept the wild monster

285
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,280
and didn't hit it directly.

286
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,720
What does this mean?

287
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,040
Smiling is also here to play.

288
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,480
Is he going to keep the wild monster

289
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,120
to Smiling?

290
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,600
Now the level is low.

291
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,120
If we let the economy go,

292
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,000
it's okay.

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And now,

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,760
the other side's level

295
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,800
can be reduced.

296
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
The decision of the DGDS

297
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,400
is a bit hard to get.

298
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,960
Yes, it is.

299
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,200
I just know the weird monster.

300
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,280
Is the power of the grass

301
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,080
so great?

302
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,120
In addition to K, Smiling

303
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
also specialized in the grass.

304
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,800
I'll help you watch the game.

305
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,640
I'll go to the play.

306
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,200
See?

307
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,880
The monster of the light

308
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,080
has already come to the play.

309
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,240
Then K and Smiling

310
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,920
will keep the light.

311
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,520
The light is coming.

312
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,280
K, go.

313
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,880
Okay.

314
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,120
The monster is coming.

315
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,040
We have to go to the big pavilion

316
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,720
to help the monster

317
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
to keep the wild monster.

318
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,720
Keep it.

319
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,600
The pavilion is in the middle of the river.

320
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,680
The monster will be killed

321
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,760
by the monster.

322
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,640
Nice.

323
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,400
Take the blood.

324
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,080
Nice.

325
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,680
Nice.

326
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,000
It's so great.

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,960
The Mid-Night Alliance

328
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,800
and the Old K and Smiling

329
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,720
are in the middle of the river.

330
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,800
What's going on?

331
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,440
What's going on?

332
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,160
They are in the middle of the river.

333
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,200
Why didn't you tell me?

334
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,120
How do I know?

335
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,840
I pushed the ice

336
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,440
and went to the back car.

337
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,640
I thought I was back.

338
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,200
How did he know

339
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
you would go to the jungle at this time?

340
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,880
It's normal for Old K

341
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,320
to finish the jungle

342
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,840
and go to the lower jungle.

343
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,320
They are hanging up.

344
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,560
You are talking big.

345
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,960
You are still expecting us to fall down.

346
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,840
You can't fall down.

347
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,040
But the problem is that

348
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
they are not

349
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,440
in the other side's field.

350
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,240
Do you know

351
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,360
Guang is going to go to the jungle?

352
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,040
In my opinion,

353
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,400
ZGDX must have

354
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,440
been a professional player.

355
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,720
Whether it's a normal game

356
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
or a normal training game,

357
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,800
you are quite funny

358
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,080
to remember something on the notebook.

359
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,480
Of course.

360
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,080
Miss Xiao.

361
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,280
Only game.

362
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,840
If it's true,

363
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,440
it's too professional and too funny.

364
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
As an old team,

365
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,520
can you make a new team

366
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,560
so transparent

367
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,240
and have some things?

368
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,320
And ZGDX

369
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,120
if you really

370
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,360
have the title of King Battle,

371
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
then today's game

372
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
is really dangerous.

373
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,800
Come on, Old K.

374
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,520
Today we caught him.

375
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,600
He is holding the ground.

376
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,040
You can see

377
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,880
Old K is already

378
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,080
in the grass.

379
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,240
It seems that the game

380
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,400
of the other team

381
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,560
is completely surrounded by VGDX.

382
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,240
Xiao.

383
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,120
When the King Battle,

384
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
ZGDX is here.

385
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,000
Xiao.

386
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,720
Old K is going to the most beautiful

387
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,760
and beautiful place

388
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,680
and go to Yangchang.

389
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,520
Wow, you are so beautiful.

390
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
It's still a long way.

391
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Zhang Shen, my friends, goodbye.

392
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,080
Look at the core skill of ZGDX.

393
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,880
The skill

394
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,920
that can be used to predict the opponent's

395
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,360
skill.

396
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,960
ZGDX's

397
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,400
spirit

398
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,360
is a little bit

399
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,760
strong in his smiley hands.

400
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,200
In this game,

401
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,320
the eye of the eye

402
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:16,960
is almost

403
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
completely surrounded by VGDX.

404
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,440
Yes.

405
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,680
Even if the sand and sand

406
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
are not sent by the people,

407
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,120
the economy

408
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,680
is still poor.

409
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,480
That's right.

410
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,200
It's so comfortable.

411
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,840
What's going on with the Lord?

412
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,320
I don't dare to show my face.

413
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,080
Old K,

414
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,040
Guang is in their area.

415
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,840
Follow me.

416
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,480
Okay.

417
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Let's go.

418
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,800
Wow, this ZGDX

419
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,600
is going to be a team again.

420
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
The time is very good at this time.

421
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,120
Guang is not big.

422
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,040
And the whole team

423
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,320
is under pressure from the whole team.

424
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,360
Beautiful.

425
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,720
The King of Tongyuan

426
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,280
completely surrounded

427
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,560
the Lord's jungle.

428
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Wow.

429
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Wow.

430
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Wow.

431
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Wow.

432
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,440
We see that

433
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,160
the Chiseman

434
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,560
has been in the team.

435
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
The same team.

436
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
The Lord of the Night.

437
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Can the King

438
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
bear the pressure

439
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
and protect the high ground?

440
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Be careful.

441
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Got it.

442
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
After the King's team

443
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
lost the core

444
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
and the jungle's output,

445
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
ZGDX's 3000 pressure

446
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
has become a little bit strong.

447
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
And look,

448
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
the Chiseman

449
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
is in the second tower.

450
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Come on.

451
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Okay.

452
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
I'm going up.

453
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Go up.

454
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Okay.

455
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Go up.

456
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
Go up.

457
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
The Lord's jungle is coming.

458
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Is there a chance?

459
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
The top tower is on the high ground.

460
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
The ZGDX is also

461
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
on the high ground.

462
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Go on.

463
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
I'm not going to stop.

464
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
The live broadcast has been stopped.

465
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
The team battle is over.

466
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,560
The blood pressure is completely high.

467
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
The Chiseman is the leader of the Chiseman.

468
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
The only thing left is the shield.

469
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
The shield.

470
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Go up.

471
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
The champion's tower.

472
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
The jungle is chasing him hard.

473
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,760
The leader of the jungle

474
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,560
is on the high ground.

475
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
This game is really a battle.

476
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Congratulations, ZGDX.

477
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,560
You have won the first round.

478
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Congratulations, ZGDX.

479
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
You have won the second round.

480
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
This is the first match

481
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,680
of the group A

482
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,560
at the National Championship of the OPL 2020.

483
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
In the game of ZGDX's PIN,

484
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
ZGDX has won the second round.

485
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,560
The current score for the team

486
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
is still 0-1.

487
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,640
That's right.

488
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:35,040
oss

489
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,440
Very good.

490
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,120
He's not dead yet.

491
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,320
He's been in a state of death.

492
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,960
Yes.

493
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,320
And ZGDX

494
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,640
is very good at

495
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,840
playing against the King.

496
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,960
You can say that

497
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,840
a strong old man

498
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,320
can play against a

499
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,960
working man.

500
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,640
He's very good at

501
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,880
playing against the King.

502
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,120
He's very professional.

503
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,080
He's very skilled.

504
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,240
So ZGDX

505
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,320
won this game

506
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,400
because of you.

507
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,320
Yes.

508
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,360
We also congratulate ZGDX

509
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,680
for winning the second

510
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,200
national championship.

511
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,640
Congratulations.

512
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,120
Congratulations.

513
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,800
Congratulations.

514
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,480
Changge.

515
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,680
I didn't expect that

516
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,720
ZGDX would study the information

517
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,640
of the team.

518
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,720
He's really good.

519
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
He's very talented.

520
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,120
It's our team

521
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
who's most nervous.

522
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,600
Don't be too nervous.

523
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,160
Congratulations.

524
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,200
ZGDX.

525
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,200
What are you doing?

526
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,920
Did you talk to someone?

527
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,200
Did you get a shock?

528
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,200
You just talked to him.

529
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,720
Changge.

530
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,920
The MVP interview is about to start.

531
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Please go to the interview room.

532
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,800
Okay.

533
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,480
Help me pack up.

534
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,760
Okay.

535
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,600
I'll go.

536
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,520
Why do you keep calling me a kid?

537
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,600
Congratulations, ZGDX.

538
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,480
Congratulations to the Chessmen

539
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,200
for winning the first

540
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,280
national championship

541
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,760
of the OPL.

542
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,240
Is there anything

543
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,200
you want to say to the fans?

544
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,920
Thank you for your support.

545
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,720
The national championship will be won.

546
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,120
It seems that

547
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,600
you know the fans' expectations.

548
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,960
I want to ask you.

549
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,000
The competition you're playing today

550
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
is the training course

551
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,040
for the OPL.

552
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,440
ZGDX is a traditional team.

553
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,760
They've prepared it well.

554
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,240
It's a big surprise.

555
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,440
How can they do that?

556
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,960
Is it your chance to win?

557
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,120
No.

558
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
It's our mid-term.

559
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,520
Everyone is scared.

560
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,600
We're just a little bit

561
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,480
of a team.

562
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,480
Before the game starts this morning,

563
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
he's still announcing

564
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,000
that we're going to play.

565
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,120
It seems that Chengge and ZGDX

566
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,280
are in a good relationship.

567
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,240
It's not a bad relationship.

568
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,280
My goodness.

569
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,520
I usually think

570
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,440
bro,

571
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,240
surprise team will not be

572
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,160
that strong.

573
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,320
It's not my day to do anything.

574
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,360
You come here.

575
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,360
No need to rush.

576
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,600
Yes.

577
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
Forget it.

578
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,040
But he's very strong.

579
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
His attitude is also very serious.

580
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,000
As a captain,

581
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm very happy to have such a match.

582
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,600
By introducing him to me,

583
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,800
The sound of the alarm is so loud.

584
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Why are you so slow?

585
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,160
The computer and the mouse are connected.

586
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,400
I need some time to draw.

587
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,560
Guys,

588
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,720
we will use the DQ5 station

589
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,600
to take a break later.

590
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,520
Please clean up.

591
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,680
I'm a weirdo, right?

592
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,000
Take these away.

593
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,720
Almost forgot.

594
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,280
The power is full of the queen.

595
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm tired.

596
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,280
It's true that there are always

597
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
strong and full of the queen.

598
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,320
Perfect.

599
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,520
Hello.

600
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,800
I just said to clean up.

601
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,720
Who cares about me?

602
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Why do you always

603
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
clean up when he says to clean up?

604
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,960
Don't be so formal.

605
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,920
You guys,

606
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,120
I will report you to the DQ5 station later.

607
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Go now.

608
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,520
You are the first one to report me.

609
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,440
Go, go, go.

610
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
I'm not afraid.

611
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,400
You can't run away.

612
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,560
Tong Yao,

613
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
when is Brother Cheng back?

614
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,360
I don't know.

615
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,600
You came so late.

616
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,320
Didn't you see him?

617
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,240
I didn't see him.

618
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm telling you,

619
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,080
Brother Cheng's performance today,

620
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,360
he will take

621
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,120
so many people's burden.

622
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,360
We have to wait until the New Year.

623
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,320
Hurry up.

624
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,160
The promotion of Jingxuan Yang is about to start.

625
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,920
Look at the price.

626
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,640
I'm afraid it's not the promotion of Jingxuan Yang.

627
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,760
It's the KING battle.

628
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,400
Look at this.

629
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,960
The promotion of the new year is still the same.

630
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,480
How is the promotion of the new year?

631
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,960
The ZGDS team is so bad.

632
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,560
Look at this.

633
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,160
It's so bad.

634
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,680
It's the worst.

635
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,320
The KING's game is so funny.

636
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,200
It's still the same.

637
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,360
The OPL is also going to be played

638
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,600
in the first place of the new year.

639
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,320
Why no one praised my performance today?

640
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,080
How can I praise you?

641
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,520
The whole team is going to give

642
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,320
the KING battle a 5-point score.

643
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
What?

644
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,520
Well,

645
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,200
someone said that

646
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,080
the battle of 10 seconds

647
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,000
will be finished in 9 seconds.

648
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,920
The support is all over the place.

649
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,600
He won't even let go of his shield.

650
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,000
Anyway, the people are scolding him.

651
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,800
It's not a lie.

652
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,080
Although it's the people are scolding him,

653
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,120
I think

654
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,400
the team's jungle light

655
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
is the worst.

656
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,800
Yes, it's really the worst.

657
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,400
He wanted to enter the jungle

658
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,960
from the first game.

659
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,400
But the same old KING found out

660
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,680
that the ice is already starting.

661
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,400
Why didn't you tell me

662
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
that the middle class is missing?

663
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,840
It's you.

664
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
The whole game

665
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,680
is exposed under our vision.

666
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,040
The jungle is a mess.

667
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,160
Through the hard work of the first game,

668
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
the team has the advantage of creating the early game.

669
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
A coward who only lost in the early game,

670
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,760
the head of the field,

671
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,600
and the wild area.

672
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,120
He must be taken by the audience

673
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,000
and hanged to the wall.

674
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,280
What a coincidence.

675
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,960
Second,

676
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
Guang is also doing this.

677
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,960
He lost in the wild area in the early game.

678
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,160
The key team

679
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,480
didn't even support him.

680
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,440
The four of them

681
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
came after the team was dead.

682
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,440
When he came here,

683
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,520
he lost almost all of them.

684
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,800
He even sent us the last person.

685
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,960
After the first game,

686
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,680
they must have known that there was a problem.

687
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,800
But it's hard to find a solution

688
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,560
at the moment.

689
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,640
So, in the second game,

690
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,920
they knew that they couldn't defeat them.

691
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,400
Guang could only play the game

692
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,160
and wait for the game.

693
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,200
They had a chance to play the game.

694
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,920
What else could they do?

695
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,720
You think the team

696
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,080
is concerned about you?

697
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,680
They can see it.

698
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,240
First,

699
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,080
Guang failed in the wild.

700
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,960
He couldn't defeat them.

701
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,720
He lost in the wild.

702
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,120
Second,

703
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,360
Guang couldn't defeat them

704
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,320
and lost in the wild.

705
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,680
He was in the game.

706
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,680
These are the most superficial

707
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,960
and the most frequent things.

708
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
So, he scolded Guang the most.

709
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
He said everything he could.

710
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,200
Who is he?

711
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,720
He is the best.

712
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,040
Don't say that.

713
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,120
It seems that it's easy to win the ZGDX.

714
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,680
Where are you going?

715
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
I'm going to the bathroom.

716
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,320
Come back soon.

717
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,560
We'll leave when Brother Cheng comes back.

718
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,400
Here.

719
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,400
The trash.

720
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,960
The queen of the tree fell down.

721
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,680
Yes.

722
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,920
The upper line is fast and the lower line is fast.

723
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,600
It's not working.

724
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,480
It's...

725
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,400
Why is it me?

726
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,320
Go ahead.

727
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,280
Or I'll report you.

728
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,600
Go ahead.

729
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,680
Go ahead.

730
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,240
I said go ahead.

731
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,920
Yes.

732
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,480
Don't lose it.

733
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,400
Wait for me to finish eating.

734
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,720
Go ahead.

735
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,040
I heard there was no sound in the room.

736
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,000
So I came in to see.

737
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,280
I'm kidding.

738
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,960
Why are you hiding here alone?

739
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,760
You know nothing.

740
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
It's because you lost the game?

741
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,080
It's related to a competition

742
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,600
made by the player

743
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,720
who barely starts playing olded pigs.

744
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,640
We were so happy

745
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,680
but it didn't work.

746
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,760
We dropped it like this.

747
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,720
It'd been bad

748
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,120
if you couldn't keep Honda

749
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,560
when the results didn't match.

750
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,800
look.

751
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,400
You didn't watch

752
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,440
themy band

753
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
I lost the game because I won.

754
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
I did my best to prepare for the game.

755
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,720
I can't accept the fact that

756
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
something happened to me.

757
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,240
I want to tell everyone

758
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,400
that there's no way for him

759
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,160
to be in the team for now.

760
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,560
He can't do it.

761
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,000
It's because he really can't.

762
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,040
It'll be better if he's prepared next time.

763
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,080
But there's no chance.

764
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
So many people,

765
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
so many cards,

766
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
so many people.

767
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,000
I can't make it.

768
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,280
You know that those people

769
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,560
lost the game because they won.

770
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,400
Why do you care so much?

771
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,280
Because I said I could always win against the team.

772
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,880
I'll give the team a chance to create.

773
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,120
Although I'm on the surface,

774
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,400
I'm the only one who's trying to catch up with the chance.

775
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,800
But what they don't know is

776
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,600
that every team of ours

777
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
has the chance to be like this.

778
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
They're working hard.

779
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,200
They're dreaming of entering the OPL

780
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,800
and showing their strength

781
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,600
in front of the whole country.

782
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
I know ZGDX is strong.

783
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,120
We shouldn't have done it.

784
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,800
I thought that even if we lost,

785
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,600
it wouldn't be so bad.

786
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,320
At least we won't have a chance.

787
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,880
In our heart,

788
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,760
what we've always wanted

789
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,160
is a chance to win like this.

790
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,360
I know.

791
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
How do you know?

792
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,720
In a match,

793
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,040
you're so strong.

794
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,360
And you're strong too.

795
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,400
No one will be mad at you.

796
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,480
No one will be scolded.

797
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,440
Maybe only our captain.

798
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,320
If one day

799
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,040
ZGDX loses the game,

800
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,920
they'll definitely fall down.

801
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,320
Do you think they'll let me go?

802
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,120
Actually, your mood now

803
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,280
is because you were too high when you won.

804
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,120
So you'll feel hurt

805
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,560
if you lose now.

806
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,400
I'm familiar with this feeling.

807
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
When I just joined the team,

808
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,160
I was born to be a cow.

809
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm not afraid of tigers.

810
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,520
I won a training game and I was so excited.

811
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,200
Later,

812
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,560
I met a team of Korean TAT.

813
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,720
You know that, right?

814
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,080
That time,

815
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,960
I was so scared by Ata.

816
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,960
Now, when I was playing the round,

817
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,360
I saw the ID

818
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,440
and I was still scared.

819
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,400
I haven't found the full way yet.

820
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,160
But from the start of the whole country,

821
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,160
your state has always been good.

822
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,040
I can't see you nervous.

823
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,920
I'm not used to it.

824
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,440
You and your team

825
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
are very good together.

826
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,880
I think your other teammates

827
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,120
are very confident in you.

828
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640
Your team is also very good.

829
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,520
And that's where

830
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,360
your career is just beginning.

831
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,720
As the new squad leader from the Xie Wei game,

832
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,600
after meeting more team members,

833
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,120
after the game and the battle,

834
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,120
you still have a lot of room for improvement.

835
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,720
When you meet again at the game field,

836
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,240
you'll become stronger.

837
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,520
Such a wordsd surprise to us,

838
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,920
when playing in top rookie teams,

839
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,680
we will not be too nervous.

840
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,600
As a result,

841
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Qingqing is sometimes

842
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,800
toward you.

843
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,720
Qingqing?

844
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,920
Will Qingqing Sonsong really be

845
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,640
asleep at this었습니다すferein?

846
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
What are you

847
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,780
doing to a brick me on my back?

848
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,680
I wonder if you really needjähr

849
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,400
to ask me about it.

850
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,520
and the team.

851
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,040
I watched all the games

852
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,000
of your team.

853
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,640
All the conclusions

854
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,320
were made after the game.

855
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,200
Before the game,

856
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,400
I was watching the final game of the Xie Wei game.

857
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,560
Look at my black circle.

858
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,320
So don't cry.

859
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,760
Why?

860
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,960
There is a clear goal.

861
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,880
And I'm trying to get it.

862
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,400
Isn't this a good thing?

863
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,560
If the game is meaningful,

864
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,200
isn't it just like this?

865
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,960
Without any team,

866
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
another team

867
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,600
can win easily.

868
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,400
So don't waste your time.

869
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,280
Just sit on the spot

870
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
where your OPL is.

871
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,240
You're a bit messy.

872
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,400
I just don't like to be pushed by my brain.

873
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,280
I'm afraid of you

874
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,360
even if I beat you.

875
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,800
Isn't it nice?

876
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,480
Not at all.

877
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,480
I пропart every day

878
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,680
before the game.

879
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,800
And I am fragrance of matte water.

880
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,680
How many times do you watch urban horse racing?

881
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,280
Right.

882
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
You're rich.

883
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,960
How about this?

884
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,960
You still have to work hard to earn money.

885
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Only a few can beat the top.

886
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,200
So,

887
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,280
I lost to Tai?

888
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,960
Why don't you say anything?

889
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,360
What are you thinking?

890
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,840
When I opened your eyes,

891
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,000
I also understood a reason.

892
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,520
What reason?

893
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,880
People look at you

894
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,640
before you lose your mind.

895
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,080
Who knows how many homeworks I've done under my own roof?

896
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,080
We're all human beings.

897
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,480
How could we have someone

898
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,880
who looks like an alien?

899
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,200
So,

900
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,800
don't be too low-key.

901
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,560
Don't fight without a ready-made palm.

902
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,560
Thank you.

903
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,200
Let's go.

904
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,800
Brother Cheng.

905
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,760
Can we talk?

906
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,800
You didn't pick up for me since the last number?

907
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,640
So you hide here.

908
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:55,840
I...

909
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
What're you playing?

910
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,040
Are you ready?

911
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:00,960
The place you picked

912
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,200
really made us stay awake.

913
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,320
Great.

914
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:03,920
Very smart.

915
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,800
What do you mean?

916
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,040
Please speak properly.

917
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,040
Thank you.

918
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,580
I gotta go.

919
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,480
Right away.

920
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,120
You've made the other team's team

921
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,760
cry in the safe passage.

922
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,120
What do you mean?

923
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,560
It's on the surface.

924
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,160
Why did she use that kind of

925
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,240
hospitalization to visit you?

926
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,840
She was in the safe passage just now.

927
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,680
I was there too.

928
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,560
She did cry just now.

929
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,440
But...

930
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,360
How can I put it?

931
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,680
Can you talk properly?

932
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
She's going to cry

933
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
and cry on the surface.

934
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,120
She can't cry on the surface.

935
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,040
Then why did she use

936
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
that kind of hospitalization to visit you?

937
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
Why is that hospitalization?

938
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,440
Tell me what hospitalization it is.

939
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,680
Don't you think it's a worship?

940
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,040
It's a worship of the god of luck.

941
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,520
Where are they?

942
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,200
You're still waiting for them

943
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
to do this kind of thing?

944
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,960
You said you and the captain of the team

945
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,320
had a grudge against each other.

946
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,520
You played two games

947
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,640
and collected two team members.

948
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,600
You're so greedy.

949
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,480
Did OPR 2020

950
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,760
send you a postcard?

951
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,120
Shut up.

952
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,920
You're also the captain.

953
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm sorry.

954
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,520
I'm back.

955
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,400
Where did you go?

956
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,120
Qi You.

957
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,640
Brother Cheng just came back.

958
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,360
He saw you were gone.

959
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,960
He also took the risk of being chased by fans

960
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,640
and went back to you.

961
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,760
You didn't answer your phone.

962
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,720
He thought you were kidnapped.

963
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,280
Why would I be kidnapped?

964
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,400
Would I go to kidnap them?

965
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,800
Miss.

966
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,640
Where did you go just now?

967
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,320
To the bathroom.

968
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,440
Why did the captain say you loved Qi You?

969
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,480
I just saw

970
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,600
King's eye

971
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,520
in the bathroom.

972
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,640
I was just going to say it.

973
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,880
But the team was really angry.

974
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,520
And they almost pushed us to the sky.

975
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,680
That's not good for me.

976
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,560
You even dare to watch the team after losing the game.

977
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,680
On the day of the Spring Contest and the final,

978
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,640
Xiaorui put all the team

979
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,240
in our phone

980
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,360
and put them all down.

981
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,760
The new person just got on the road.

982
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
And the King's team

983
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,120
is very strong in the game.

984
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,320
They were all praised by others.

985
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,960
And you comfort others.

986
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
What's that?

987
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,920
That's not someone else.

988
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
That's an enemy.

989
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,280
What if he's been comforted by you?

990
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,120
What should we do?

991
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,720
They can't beat us

992
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
if they're not.

993
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
Because we're also being comforted.

994
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,720
That's right.

995
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,960
When I see you again,

996
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,480
I want to understand one thing.

997
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,760
Before others saw you

998
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,120
beat you up,

999
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,280
they all knew how many homework you did.

1000
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,520
We're all human beings.

1001
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,720
How could there be someone

1002
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,160
who's as strong as an alien?

1003
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,520
Okay.

1004
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,360
Can you show me this?

1005
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,480
No.

1006
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
Brother Cheng.

1007
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,200
What?

1008
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Excuse me.

1009
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,440
Why do you want me to do that?

1010
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,400
No way.

1011
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,080
Say it fast.

1012
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,720
I want to do it again Google Ife.

1013
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,560
I'm afraid of you.

1014
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,880
Okay.

1015
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,040
What do you want?

1016
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,880
No.

1017
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,040
I don't agree.

1018
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:09,920
I can't agree.

1019
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,880
Why not?

1020
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:11,880
Go.

1021
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,040
I support you.

1022
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:13,920
No.

1023
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,320
There will be two more competitions next week.

1024
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,480
What if it's like last time?

1025
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,440
My heart is beating fast.

1026
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,080
Shut up.

1027
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,320
The rest of the competition

1028
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,800
is up to me.

1029
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,560
I'm sorry.

1030
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm sorry.

1031
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,680
I'm sorry.

1032
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,240
I'm sorry.

1033
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,800
I'm sorry.

1034
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,440
I'm sorry.

1035
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm sorry.

1036
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Brother Cheng.

1037
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,320
I...

1038
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Are you sure?

1039
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,760
Yes.

1040
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Brother Cheng, are you crazy?

1041
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,800
Even if I don't help him,

1042
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,680
he can do something to others.

1043
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,520
We'll meet another time.

1044
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,280
Date done.

1045
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,280
Tomorrow afternoon.

1046
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,000
Tomorrow?

1047
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,120
That's too fast.

1048
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,480
Today is going to be hard.

1049
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,000
Confess.

1050
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,920
Confess.

1051
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,600
I'm sorry.

1052
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,400

1053
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,280

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm sorry.

1076
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
