1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first match of the OPL Tournament

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first match of the OPL Tournament

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Dear fans, I'm here again.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
The only one who is really good at listening to the story.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
The OPL Tournament is about to begin.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Each team is preparing for the first place.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
However, the YQCB team is still in the lead.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Since the ZJDXT's mid-term return,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the first place is also in the second place.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, smiley,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
who are you?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're not the first place either.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Why are you so serious?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm definitely the first place.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're definitely not the first place.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're definitely not the first place.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Come here.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Instructor, you come here.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Instructor, you're the first place.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're definitely not the first place.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're definitely not the first place.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're definitely not the first place.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're definitely not the first place.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're definitely not the first place.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're definitely not the first place.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're definitely not the first place.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're definitely not the first place.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're definitely not the first place.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're definitely not the first place.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're definitely not the first place.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're definitely not the first place.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're definitely not the first place.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're definitely not the first place.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The End

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mr. Rui, you're finally here.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Brother Cheng is here too.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come on, come inside.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Come on, come on.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This way please.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The foundation is too thick.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is it?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let me see.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's real.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then I won't give you a discount.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll just give you a discount.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh my god.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Brother Cheng, your skin is so good.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I know.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you have any secret to keep?

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Young.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're already very handsome.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You don't need to draw it.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You can't.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll be more handsome.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Baby, come on.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why are you drawing my eyebrows?

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
My eyebrows are very handsome.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, they are.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But the height of the two sides is different.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did you find it?

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is there?

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The foundation is No. 502.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And the foundation is No. 303.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This way it looks natural and natural.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't draw eyes.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It looks so weird.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Are you sure?

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Brother Rui, come and take a look.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
After I drew my eyes with the cat,

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
is it more delicate?

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Keep drawing.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come on, Tiansu.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're not drawing like this.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Little brother, bring me more.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have a big face.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Your face is not big.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Really?

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is the first time I hear people say that.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's because there are more meat.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, look at my eyes.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Tong Yao, you haven't finished your drawing.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a problem for women.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's okay.

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We should take a personal look first.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's go.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go first.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
After they finish their drawing,

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you should be okay.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's okay.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Draw slowly.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Wait, brother Rui.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Where is the team's uniform?

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's on the sofa.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What about the doctor?

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can find a place to change it.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No one will see it anyway.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You want to change it?

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll go out first.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No hurry.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll change it again.

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll go out first.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is this ZG-DX?

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is this ZG-DX?

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We are all famous.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They are the best.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Fatty.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You should take pictures of yourselves.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Fatty.

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Fatty.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Fatty.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Fatty.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Fatty.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Fatty.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Fatty.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Fatty.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Fatty.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Fatty.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Fatty.

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Fatty.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Fatty.

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Fatty.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Fatty.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Fatty.

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Fatty.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Fatty,

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You can take a picture.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you don't have a contrast,

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you'll definitely be a handsome guy in a pants.

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you.

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You've said this before last year.

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's almost time.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's almost time for a photo shoot.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's almost time.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why hasn't our little sister come yet?

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We've finished taking the white ones.

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
She won't make herself a model, right?

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Women are models.

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When they say they're going out,

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
they'll wash their hair and blow their hair.

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They'll match with clothes, spray perfume,

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
choose a bag and shoes.

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah.

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're right.

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll arrange it.

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Brother Zheng.

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why don't you take her over?

154
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll go.

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're really going to arrange it?

156
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
She's afraid of you.

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
When you show your face,

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
she'll get mad and keep you out of it.

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Come on, Xiaopeng.

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Come on, continue.

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Mr. Tong Ning.

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Look at my eyes.

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do I have to add some more?

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, it's fine.

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How do I feel that my eyelashes are going to fall off?

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They're really very good, sister.

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't worry.

168
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
They won't fall off.

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They'll blow you up later.

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll go change my clothes first.

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll go change my clothes first.

173
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then you change your clothes first.

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you.

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It seems that Jingyang is still experienced.

176
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't really think that

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
he really respects her anymore.

178
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Delicious.

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,760
tas

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She's too much, give it some strength.

181
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sanxin,

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,040
Lei Li!

183
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,840
Lei Li!

184
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,280
Brother, what is wrong?

185
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,460
He has rolled his tongue.

186
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm, Brother.

187
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,280
Where's that mole?

188
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,460
Go back first.

189
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,420
I brought all of them.

190
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,620
Okay.

191
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,060
Then hurry up.

192
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,020
Who were you talking to?

193
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,740
Lu Yu.

194
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,940
Put on your clothes and come out.

195
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,900
Don't be so quiet.

196
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,900
So you just saw it?

197
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,900
Not yet.

198
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,460
The pattern is very small.

199
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
But I saw it.

200
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
I told you to hide it before entering.

201
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,620
Lu Yu wanted to come in directly.

202
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
I stopped her.

203
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,900
What about you?

204
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,900
What's wrong with Lu Yu?

205
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,900
You stayed in there for 40 minutes.

206
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,220
I pushed the door to see you in this state.

207
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,700
I saw you lying on the floor with this kind of clothes.

208
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I can't see it.

209
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,820
But sorry.

210
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,020
I'll ask for your forgiveness next time.

211
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,300
Lu Si Cheng will apologize to me?

212
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,620
You...

213
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,940
Are you crazy?

214
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,060
Why did you suddenly apologize to me?

215
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,780
I thought you needed an apology.

216
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,940
I do.

217
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,020
You're going to marry me in ancient times.

218
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,100
Don't be too much.

219
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Don't be too much.

220
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,380
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,780
You're finally here.

222
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,500
Miss.

223
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
What's wrong with your face?

224
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,940
What's wrong?

225
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:42,380
Have you seen the monkey's

226
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,100
double-handed arm?

227
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,540
It's a little bit of a sunburn.

228
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,780
It's a bit of a sight.

229
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
It's a bit of a sight.

230
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,820
Okay.

231
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,460
Isn't it a big face?

232
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,700
Yes.

233
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,820
It's a bit of a sight.

234
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,580
I don't have any eyes.

235
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,940
But it's a bad thing.

236
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,580
Just imagine that you're a queen.

237
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,620
Queen?

238
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:05,900
Yes.

239
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,660
You asked Miss. Mushi to pretend to be a queen.

240
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,380
You have to think about whether she's willing to marry me.

241
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,180
Lu Yue.

242
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,300
You're going to take a group photo with Tong Yao.

243
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,900
You want that kind of life-threatening and ferocious feeling.

244
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,220
That kind of extreme action.

245
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,300
Full of murderous,

246
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420
and the kind of endless war between power and arrest.

247
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,500
You two have to create a kind of

248
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,740
conflict between you two

249
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,940
because of the economic relationship.

250
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,460
Let him go.

251
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,460
Here.

252
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,620
Take out the weak sense of being a stoolman.

253
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,860
Xiaorui actually wants your original appearance.

254
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,100
Okay.

255
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,100
I'm sorry, Master.

256
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,660
I'll come in to do something fun at the Fie yourself.

257
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,900
I give you two a chance,

258
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,700
but I want young and young seniors could say

259
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,020
as much as I can.

260
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,740
Xiao Bai.

261
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,300
Hello.

262
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,140
What are you up to?

263
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,100
These final thoughts?

264
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,180
It's simple.

265
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,180
Thank you.

266
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,460
Thank you, Father.

267
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,020
Shoot.

268
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,580
Shoot.

269
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,820
What's all this?

270
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,580
task will be enough

271
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,060
Mr.O fabrication

272
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,400
That's right

273
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,620
Using 않았

274
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,520
Pass

275
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,240
Pay attention

276
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,940
Let that young master follow

277
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,460
Give another half

278
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,160
Yes

279
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,640
I come just in time

280
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,020
By the time your lady comes

281
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,260
that young master bar to a new era

282
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,600
Let that young master bar to the new era

283
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,320
She can'tIS

284
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,360
Take out the我不

285
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,200
You go down first.

286
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,240
I didn't ask you to stand up.

287
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,040
Brother Chen, sit down.

288
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,480
Why do I feel like a photo of a wedding dress?

289
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,920
Shush.

290
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,160
Go.

291
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Look here.

292
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,320
I'll show you.

293
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,920
You can do it.

294
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,440
You can do it.

295
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,960
Go to the top.

296
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,720
Wait for me.

297
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,680
Wait for me to control the enemy's level.

298
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,000
Go back.

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
Go.

300
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,480
Come on, cat.

301
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,440
The master of the fire department is being sealed.

302
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,520
Come on.

303
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,680
Come on.

304
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,240
Yes.

305
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,000
Easy.

306
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,360
Sister, the food.

307
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,320
You're staring at me like a rabbit.

308
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
Can I have a good time?

309
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,640
Besides, I won.

310
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,680
Since you won,

311
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,920
I'll order a afternoon tea.

312
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
What do you want to eat?

313
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,800
I want to eat...

314
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,080
What do you want to eat?

315
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,440
You don't have to order.

316
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,560
Jian Yang will come to me later.

317
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,280
I'll go with him.

318
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,000
I ordered a dish for you.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,480
This one.

320
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,120
I ordered a dish for you.

321
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,760
This one.

322
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,080
I've tried this before.

323
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,280
What's wrong?

324
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,080
Guan Bo sent us a picture of a wedding dress yesterday.

325
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,720
This picture is really good.

326
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,240
Look at this.

327
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,720
Good.

328
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,040
It's so handsome.

329
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,360
Look at the back.

330
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,000
My life.

331
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,440
You finally show up.

332
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,640
This picture feels good.

333
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,200
The new generation of light and shadow are born.

334
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,520
They're getting more and more excited about the national competition.

335
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,240
Yueyue is now a winner.

336
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,200
Yueyue is a famous and handsome young man.

337
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,400
Didn't Sister Sma and Brother Cheng come together?

338
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,240
This picture is to be filmed.

339
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,720
Cheng Yao is in charge of this place.

340
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,640
Don't move.

341
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,240
What's with the fairest turntable in the world?

342
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
I sent Guan Bo this.

343
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,400
The public could understand if you had seen the picture clearly.

344
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm asking my sons

345
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
if they have girlfriends.

346
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Why do they take photos

347
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
of Qingli Zhao's official post?

348
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
And they say

349
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
they're all the same girl.

350
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Hey, mom.

351
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Hey, mom.

352
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I thought it was not what you thought.

353
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
My brother?

354
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Only my brother?

355
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm not even a friend.

356
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Hey, mom.

357
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
My brother?

358
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Only my brother?

359
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
I'm not even a friend.

360
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Luckily, my parents are not unmarried.

361
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
It tastes good.

362
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
It tastes good.

363
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
It tastes better

364
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
with the photos of the girl.

365
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
The photos are good.

366
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
What?

367
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
We're talking about the forbidden content.

368
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
The forbidden content?

369
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
So you and Brother Cheng

370
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
are in the same business

371
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
or am I blind?

372
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
What do you mean?

373
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
He dropped me from the bed

374
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
and came to see me in the face.

375
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Pretend.

376
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
You pretend.

377
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm here to work hard.

378
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Who said

379
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
you're a new woman?

380
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm here to discuss things.

381
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
You're not in charge of them.

382
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
I heard

383
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Brother Cheng and Lu Yue are brothers.

384
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Don't say that.

385
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
They look alike.

386
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
But Brother Cheng is taller.

387
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
He's handsome.

388
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
At that moment,

389
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
I had a kind of

390
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
a little handsome guy

391
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
in the electrical circle.

392
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Then?

393
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Then?

394
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Why did I

395
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
find a guy

396
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
in the circle

397
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
who's handsome?

398
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
He's handsome, too.

399
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
But he's worse than Brother Cheng.

400
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Brother Cheng is a man.

401
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Brother Cheng is a dog.

402
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
He's so stubborn.

403
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
He can't even

404
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
fall off the circle.

405
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I think

406
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
you're just a thief.

407
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
But let me tell you.

408
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
You really

409
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
wear a rabbit-shaped tiger's den

410
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
on Ding Zhuang Zhao's day.

411
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Yes.

412
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Why?

413
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Isn't it pretty?

414
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I think

415
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
I've done something wrong.

416
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
What?

417
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
But I can't say it well.

418
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Someone likes that one.

419
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
But you're a little boy.

420
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
The person who likes that one

421
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
is definitely a pervert.

422
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
What?

423
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
You and Lu Yue

424
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
are the first ones to

425
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
post this thing on the Internet.

426
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
You're so fat.

427
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Now that someone else

428
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
posted the投.

429
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
I...

430
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
That's great, sister.

431
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I didn't think

432
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
you have so many fans.

433
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm so weak and cute.

434
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Of course I have fans.

435
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm different from Lu Yue

436
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
who eats on the face.

437
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Your fans are so professional.

438
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
You even made a video

439
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
to analyze your training room.

440
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
It's like

441
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
a PPT

442
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
made in the university's

443
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Repair Department.

444
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
You're so sweet.

445
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
You're so hardworking.

446
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
You can even make a video.

447
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Let me see.

448
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Let me see what Lu Yue has.

449
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Excuse me.

450
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Are these people involved?

451
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Can they be compared with

452
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
the real power of the game?

453
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
It's just a little student.

454
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
You hate me, sister.

455
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
You're living with Wan Qian

456
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
under the same roof

457
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
for 24 hours.

458
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm going to cry.

459
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
You have a rich father.

460
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Pay attention to your words.

461
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Are you done talking?

462
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I asked you to come down to practice.

463
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
If you don't come down,

464
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll come to catch you.

465
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
No, no, no.

466
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Come down right now.

467
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Don't be impulsive.

468
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Uncle, this rabbit is holding a carrot.

469
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Don't you know it?

470
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
This rabbit is holding a carrot.

471
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Lu Yue, you should have told me.

472
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
What?

473
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
This rabbit is holding a carrot.

474
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Who is the wechat name?

475
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
No, no, no.

476
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Miss, are you okay?

477
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Why are you running?

478
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
It's dangerous.

479
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Miss, are you okay?

480
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Why are you running?

481
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
It's dangerous.

482
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
If your face is broken,

483
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
how much money do you need to spend?

484
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Yao Yao, are you okay?

485
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Come here.

486
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Did you fall somewhere?

487
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Does it hurt?

488
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Let's go.

489
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Use your phone.

490
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
What are you looking at?

491
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
You're so curious.

492
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Are you okay?

493
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I'm fine.

494
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm leaving.

495
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
You can do it.

496
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Why don't you go to the next door

497
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
and see your ex-boyfriend?

498
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
He's a good guy.

499
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
He's been chasing the fire.

500
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Let him be in the fire.

501
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
He'll be gone.

502
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Let's go.

503
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Let's go.

504
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Come out with me.

505
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Give it to me.

506
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
You can do it yourself.

507
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
It's good.

508
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm talking about the phone.

509
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I'm being held up.

510
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
What?

511
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm being held up.

512
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
What?

513
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm being held up.

514
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I don't understand what you're talking about.

515
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I'm being held up.

516
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
You're talking about that?

517
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
How do I remember

518
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
when I asked Shanshan to do it?

519
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
He told me that...

520
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
It's been a long time.

521
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
How did you remember it?

522
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Besides,

523
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
you locked me out of the door.

524
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Didn't you remember it too?

525
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
You're being held up so strangely.

526
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
If anyone sees me again,

527
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
I'll...

528
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
I'll...

529
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
I'll connect your back to me.

530
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
What do you think they'll think?

531
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Who are you going to show it to?

532
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I'm not going to show it to anyone.

533
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
But I'm not good at it.

534
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Why not?

535
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Do you think

536
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
the back of your friend Wei Xin

537
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
is his inner disciple?

538
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
This behavior is like a pervert.

539
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Pervert?

540
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
What?

541
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
The pervert doesn't treat you like a pervert.

542
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
But I'm not going to buy it.

543
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
What do you think I'm doing?

544
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
You're drunk.

545
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm not drunk.

546
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
I'm not drunk.

547
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm not drunk.

548
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I'm not drunk.

549
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
I'm not drunk.

550
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm not drunk.

551
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm not drunk.

552
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
I'm not drunk.

553
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I'm not drunk.

554
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm not drunk.

555
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm not drunk.

556
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
I'm not drunk.

557
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm not drunk.

558
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
I'm not drunk.

559
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I'm not drunk.

560
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
I'm not drunk.

561
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
I'm not drunk.

562
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm not drunk.

563
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
I'm not drunk.

564
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm not drunk.

565
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
I'm not drunk.

566
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm not drunk.

567
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
I'm not drunk.

568
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm not drunk.

569
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I'm not drunk.

570
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm not drunk.

571
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
I'm not drunk.

572
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm not drunk.

573
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm not drunk.

574
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm not drunk.

575
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Don't come over.

576
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Help!

577
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Go away!

578
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
What's your fault?

579
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Go away!

580
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
How could you make my fault?

581
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm not making your fault.

582
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
You think I'm nothing?

583
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm not.

584
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I'm just not drunk.

585
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
I'm not drunk.

586
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm not drunk.

587
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm not drunk.

588
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm not drunk.

589
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I'm not drunk.

590
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
You think I'm nothing?

591
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Are you crazy or stupid?

592
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Go away!

593
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Dabing, when you're sleeping next time,

594
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
sit on my face.

595
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Go out and sleep.

596
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
You're not a pervert.

597
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
You think I'm nothing?

598
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Are you crazy or stupid?

599
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Am I a pervert?

600
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm not just dreaming.

601
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
And I can even see you thinking of Lu Ci Chang.

602
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
The national championship is about to begin.

603
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
We have to decide the opponent first.

604
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
To get into the state quickly,

605
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
we're going to have a training match

606
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
for YQCB.

607
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
The next level team?

608
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Why should we fight them?

609
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Their new map is here.

610
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
It's a big news.

611
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
So we have to get ready in advance.

612
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Tang Yao, you go first.

613
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
You go first.

614
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Give me a letter.

615
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
You're wrong.

616
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
It's the decision of Brother Cheng and Ming.

617
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Why?

618
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
You just came back.

619
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
You haven't been in touch with everyone.

620
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Is the match today the same?

621
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Then...

622
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
I'll be punished?

623
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
It's not certain.

624
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Before the national championship begins,

625
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
we have to see the comparison of you and Lu Yue.

626
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Whoever is better will be the first to be the second.

627
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
If someone says that this afternoon,

628
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
the one who is already next to the water machine

629
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
is you.

630
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
They're ready.

631
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Let's go to the room.

632
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Come on, everyone.

633
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
I'll get something to eat.

634
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I'll leave it to you.

635
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Okay.

636
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Come on.

637
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Why is the ID of the opposite AD also messy?

638
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
What's wrong?

639
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
I didn't expect that there would be someone like you

640
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
in this world.

641
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Pay attention to your words.

642
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Everyone, fight well.

643
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Come with me.

644
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Come with me.

645
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Come on.

646
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Don't fight.

647
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Come with me.

648
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Come on.

649
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Chen, the other side's shooting is a bit fierce.

650
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
You go back and fix it.

651
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Okay.

652
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Feng Yi, you're so stubborn.

653
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
The other side's monster is stronger.

654
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
This is too fierce.

655
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Shut up. Go on.

656
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
This is the return of the two.

657
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
We're ready to retreat.

658
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Feng, follow me.

659
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I'll take the test.

660
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Yes, sir.

661
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
They're here.

662
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Go.

663
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
They're here.

664
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Why are they here?

665
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Why are they here?

666
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Xiaoxin,

667
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
why didn't the middleman see you?

668
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I saw him just now.

669
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Who knows if he's a spy?

670
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Chen,

671
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
how come they know you stole Xiaoyan?

672
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Did you just get caught?

673
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
No way.

674
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I almost got stuck on you.

675
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
How come I feel that the other side

676
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
knows your trick?

677
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Brother Cheng, hold on.

678
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm very panic.

679
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Why don't you change my wound?

680
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Go away.

681
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
I'll take your silver spoon.

682
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
The tank is open. Give me a hand.

683
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Go.

684
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Go.

685
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Go.

686
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Go.

687
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Go.

688
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Yes.

689
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Six, six, six.

690
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Brother Cheng is still the same.

691
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Brother Cheng, what are you doing?

692
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
You're going to hit them?

693
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Brother Cheng, you're going to hit them?

694
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Go away.

695
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
It's mine.

696
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Brother Cheng, where are you going?

697
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
What are you doing?

698
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Come on.

699
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Where's our ID?

700
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
You lost it.

701
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Give us our ID.

702
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
We're not a group.

703
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
We're a group.

704
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
We're a group.

705
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm going to go up.

706
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Go.

707
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
One.

708
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Two.

709
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Three.

710
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Four.

711
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Five.

712
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Six.

713
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Seven.

714
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
One.

715
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Four.

716
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Beast. Beast. Beast. Beast. Beast.

717
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,600
Beast is crazy all the time.

718
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,400
It's estimated.

719
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,240
The man is going to go with you.

720
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,200
Go.

721
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
I'm just going.

722
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Beast is so crazy.

723
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,200
Beast. Beast is crazy.

724
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,120
Beast has a group.

725
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm going to play as the person is important to people.

726
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
And he 2021 with him.

727
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,480
ī

728
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,520
ī

729
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,000
ī

730
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,520
ī

731
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,940
ī

732
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,180
ī

733
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,800
ī

734
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,760
ī

735
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,640
ī

736
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,560
So, it's the coach who went to the YQCB team.

737
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,960
What do you mean? Say it again.

738
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,840
It should be closed soon.

739
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,040
Before it was closed,

740
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,960
why is Brother Cheng so sure?

741
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,280
He knows the coach so well.

742
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,040
Didn't Xiaorui say that

743
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,920
Brother Cheng and the coach are just a group.

744
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,200
I know that.

745
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,840
But they are so close.

746
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,920
Because of that...

747
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
It's the ger Nimomnia,

748
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,260
I can't believe you asked me to be your coach.

749
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,680
It's not me!

750
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Am I my coach?

751
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,520
I got there because I thought they were friends.

752
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,400
So now it's very clear what's wrong.

753
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,320
We used to study in the first agree Willing team in North Korea.

754
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,160
Hmm.

755
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,160
It's really a high score.

756
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,480
The teaching house is YQCB.

757
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,480
And there are many fans' comments.

758
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,840
Here it comes.

759
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,640
The first-class.

760
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,040
Junhe is here.

761
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,120
I'm out of my mind.

762
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
I'm not dreaming.

763
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,760
If it's not,

764
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,040
it's love.

765
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,120
Brother Cheng, did you see it?

766
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,560
Your Junhe and my dad are here.

767
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,360
I'm curious.

768
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,040
Why did you come to China?

769
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,400
I don't understand.

770
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,040
Because of Brother Cheng.

771
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,320
Chessman and Hero Fan.

772
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,960
The teaching house and chess

773
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,360
are like the light of the galaxy.

774
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,760
But Xiaorui said that

775
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,920
although the color is a bit too much,

776
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,920
Brother Cheng used to be in the Korean industry.

777
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,600
He was busy with the big club.

778
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,200
He was going to compete in the T-Boo game.

779
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,280
Really?

780
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:21,960
So good.

781
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,800
Isn't it?

782
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,680
I didn't see Brother Cheng saying it so well.

783
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,520
He was also a conductor.

784
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,040
He just wanted to go back to China.

785
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,080
Then why did he want to go back to China?

786
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,200
He was in love with China.

787
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,000
Brother Cheng wanted to take the Chinese professional team

788
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,800
and get the world championship from this game.

789
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
So he came back.

790
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,040
I'm a little touched.

791
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
So what?

792
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,440
The teaching house is up again.

793
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
Brother Cheng was changed.

794
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,200
He had to change the reason for changing the t-boo game

795
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,480
and the t-bar.

796
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,360
He was just talking nonsense.

797
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,160
He said it in a different way.

798
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,760
Brother Cheng was not kicked back.

799
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,200
He asked himself to come back.

800
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,480
Then?

801
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,080
Of course, the teaching house is not good.

802
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,720
How can you cover the light with a wind?

803
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,200
We haven't officially fought.

804
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,320
I haven't officially defeated you.

805
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,400
Why did you leave?

806
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,440
Did you not give me everything I have now?

807
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,800
Probably that's it.

808
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,720
And then last year, we did that again.

809
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,160
We didn't get the championship anyway.

810
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,880
The two of us didn't have the chance to prove our skills.

811
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,920
That's why we came here.

812
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,760
Really?

813
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,040
Of course.

814
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,480
And the worst thing is that

815
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,280
the two of us are still very tacit.

816
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,080
Look, today,

817
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,200
because of one game,

818
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,920
Brother Cheng guessed that the other team is the teaching house.

819
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,520
And I'm still in the professional team of Jingquan Yang.

820
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,120
I saw the two of us.

821
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,800
I wanted to win and send it to Brother Cheng.

822
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,080
I don't know what his face will be like

823
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,400
when he sees it.

824
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,200
I guess he will be pissed off.

825
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,560
You are also thinking that you are lucky.

826
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay.

827
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,800
What is a colleague?

828
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,520
Have you seen 48 colleagues in the school?

829
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,960
Yes.

830
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
They are two partners.

831
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,480
Amazing.

832
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,000
Exciting.

833
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,520
But who do you think Brother Cheng and the teaching house are better?

834
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,080
Of course it's Brother Cheng.

835
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,120
The flowers are always more fragrant than wild flowers.

836
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,880
That's so annoying.

837
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,840
voeva

838
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,120
The Chen family

839
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,640
Yanに来も gentleman

840
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,160
Congratulations on being admitted to the dehydration testing.

841
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,640
Get ready.

842
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,560
happy

843
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,280
This section is for the technical exam being for investigation.

844
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,520
He name is Swansonorse.

845
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,320
And the KMID is YOURования to be allowed to run the lab for medical purposes.

846
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,720
Which kalkaryvl is the flowing coolant?

847
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
I'm not a fan of you.

848
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
I'm just a fan of you.

00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760

I'm just a fan of you.

874
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
I'm just a fan of you.

875
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
The world is gone.

876
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
So many peoplegesetzt with loneliness.

877
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Happy people among you.

878
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
That's why those who hate the most

879
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
are still alive.

880
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
I'm just a fan of you.

881
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760

I'm just a fan of you.

887
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
I'm just a fan of you.

888
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,260
If I try this one dream

889
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,260
I will follow the light

890
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:01,260
So we are on the road

891
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,260
We will burn the darkness

892
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,260
But how much we want to hide

893
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,260
How big is the heart that is so brave

894
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:17,260
Remember that moment when the wind blows

895
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,760
We look at each other like this
