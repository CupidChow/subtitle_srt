1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
La la la la Jesus

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I know that you're a bad guy, but I still have to say that when Brother Cheng said the last sentence, his right hand was put under the table.

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
At the same time, the left hand was also under the table. Brother Cheng's hand is shaking.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So what did you guys do?

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I already have someone I like.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm right.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's wrong?

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you shy?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Look at this.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Look at the details of the singer.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He's so rich. He's so rich.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He's so rich.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's so rich.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What the hell are you doing?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He's going to find out the truth.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He's going to find out the truth.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I...

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why are you so nervous?

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I was standing on the rock when I was playing the white snake.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was standing on the rock when I was playing the white snake.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I was standing on the rock when I was playing the white snake.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's a spy in the police.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He's a spy in the police.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I was scared that he'd be in charge of the show.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I didn't care. I didn't agree.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If he's with me, I don't care what kind of game he'll play.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now you know why I'm so strict.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Once I'm exposed, Your Majesty,

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you'll lose your half-dead spirit.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do you know why I agreed to be strict with you?

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Because of your half-dead spirit.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
How dare you say that?

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was afraid that the lunatic would pour dirty water on you.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He said that you can't play the game well because of his love.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He only cares about your career.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't care.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I care.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, although it won't happen,

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
even if it happens,

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm confident to hit their face with a gun.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But I don't want you to think about that.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're a person who likes to gossip.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You'll definitely get affected.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's also because of this matter.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you want to be with me?

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
After all, if other teams are looking for you,

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll definitely be the first to stand up and fight.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll warn that person not to harass him.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He'll be a good player.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then?

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why are you laughing?

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't mind me. And then?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll be the first to stand up.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
To celebrate the silver medal,

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll be the first to get a reward tomorrow.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Eat whatever you like.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I want to eat the food.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm afraid of the mud.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I want to eat the chicken.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm afraid of mud.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I want a bowl of soy milk.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want a piece of raw beef.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Brother Cheng, what do you want?

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm not eating. I'm a little sleepy.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go upstairs and rest.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why am I feeling a little hungry now?

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Tong Yao,

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
did you have something spicy in my room these days?

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Add me some more tea. Thank you.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're really good at eating.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you sure there's nothing spicy here?

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think there's something spicy in Brother Cheng's room.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It should be the electrician.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't worry about the electrician.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Where is he?

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Brother Cheng,

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
do you want breakfast?

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can order for you.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm afraid you'll get a stomachache.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I want to eat you.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Captain,

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
the meat is not enough.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The waist is broken.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What are you hiding from?

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I won't do anything to you.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're dangerous.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do we have to keep this kind of posture?

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can also lie down.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're so stupid.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I just want to thank you.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You worked so hard to cooperate with the Four Seasons' Hospital,

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
to show the style of the Ni Feng Bureau's textbook.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And to thank you

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
in front of the whole country,

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to show that you already have a new talent.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're so sincere.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're so grateful.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then,

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
do you have time tomorrow?

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then,

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
let's go to the date.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But,

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
before we go to the date,

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
should we kiss first?

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
See you tomorrow.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Fatty,

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll give you a panini.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
In less than three seconds,

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Brother Cheng will definitely appear.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Where are you going?

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm going to the date.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have a breakfast ready for you on the table.

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You guys eat.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm going out to buy something.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll go out with you.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why do you guys

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
always go out to play

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and go to the famous bureau?

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm like this every day.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Me too.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Forget it.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You too.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Last time I saw you

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
playing hard to get out,

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
or when you went to the fish market with my brother

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to buy goldfish,

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I didn't even think about it.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What's wrong?

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The blinds are going in.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're just going to play.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How's that?

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
When did you two go out together?

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm so tired.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm so tired that

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
my AD is actually abandoned.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm going to the middle.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm just kidding.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I can't accept

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
my brother's future son

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
being like his mother.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And then being laughed at.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Shut up.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't want to.

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm leaving.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This normal person like us

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
can only be lonely.

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What's wrong?

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You're not happy?

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Lu Si Cheng,

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
why didn't you react to him?

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Do you think

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
he's right?

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm so angry.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Your record-breaking perfect memory

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is about to be turned into a powerhouse

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
by my sister's sixth sister.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Your powerhouse?

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
She's kidding.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're as tall as my mother.

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You can't see who's in the group.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're in the group.

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're in the group.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're in the group.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're in the group.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're in the group.

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
When our son

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
gets in the group,

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
he'll be taller.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't worry.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Who's with you?

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
My son.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Your daughter is also good.

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Just like your mother.

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And then you can

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
be a tall boy.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Perfect.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I actually like girls.

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
She's so naughty.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Shut up.

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You can't even imagine.

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Can you imagine

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
something normal?

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I feel like

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
your voice is smiling.

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm not.

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Captain,

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
do you think

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you've been breaking up recently?

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What do you mean?

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
In my opinion,

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Chessman is a calm,

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
calm,

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and thoughtful person.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I didn't expect

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
to be a shameless,

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
old-fashioned,

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and old-fashioned.

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm very sad.

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Do you remember

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
when we first met?

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,360
I treated you as a

227
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
rotten wheat.

228
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,000
I threw the door

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
on your face.

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What did you think?

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The license.

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I thought

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you were far away.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But the license

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
doesn't mean Chessman.

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm a gentleman

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
in front of other girls.

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Isn't that great?

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can enjoy

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
my inner self

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
with your own thoughts.

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Chessman.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Chessman.

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's go.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's go.

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's go.

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's go.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm so tired.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm so tired.

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're so silly.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That...

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Forget it.

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't want to play with this.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have money to buy

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
here.

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I bought a pair of the same ones.

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's right.

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is so cute.

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I want to buy it.

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I want to buy ten.

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I want this color.

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I also confirmed

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
that it's a pair of the same.

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's so cute.

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's so cute.

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So cute.

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Which one do you want?

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think there's one.

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is a different hat.

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That rabbit is hard to catch.

271
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We haven't caught it for a long time.

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes.

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's too hard.

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
My god.

276
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's so amazing.

277
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
My mom is coming.

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's so amazing.

279
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's so amazing.

280
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's so amazing.

281
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's so amazing.

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So cool.

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to play with this one too.

284
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Which one?

285
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's so cute.

286
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The one in the middle.

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Really?

288
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's okay.

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's so amazing.

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's so amazing.

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's so amazing.

292
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I was thinking about

293
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the fact that there were

294
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
so many different types of caravans

295
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
in the amusement park.

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In the future,

297
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will find a man who can do it

298
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and come back

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
to avoid all of them.

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You did it.

301
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There's a man who can do it.

303
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Which amusement park?

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Go and buy tickets.

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I will go and get them.

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Dongqing is your enemy, Luo Yan.

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What do you want to eat in the future?

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The ice cream shop

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
was good just now.

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What ice cream do you want to eat?

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why can't I eat ice cream?

312
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You are a three-year-old child.

313
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
In your heart,

314
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
am I not a three-year-old child?

315
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You must love me forever.

316
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't lie to me.

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Next time, we will go there.

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You go there.

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Bye.

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We will go together.

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You go first.

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I will go to the cinema later.

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let's go.

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Bye.

325
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Bye.

326
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Bye.

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's okay.

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's go.

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why didn't you go to the cinema?

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Why did you wait for me?

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Why did you run away?

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I saw our fans

333
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
at the gate of the dormitory.

334
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I left it there.

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay.

336
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What are you doing?

337
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What's wrong with you?

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why are you wearing a mask?

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I can't see you.

340
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Lu Si Cheng,

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
speak.

342
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What's wrong?

343
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Because you look ugly.

344
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You don't deserve to be bald.

345
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Lu Si Cheng,

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
don't be angry.

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I didn't mean that.

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, okay.

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I was wrong.

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Can you let me go?

352
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Where are the fans?

353
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Did you see us

354
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
walking on the street?

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Do you remember

356
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the comments I showed you?

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
They don't accept you as a girlfriend.

358
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They don't accept you.

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't care.

360
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Give me your pants.

361
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't care.

362
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I care.

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not afraid of them

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
being like Chen Jing Yang.

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm not afraid of them

366
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
saying I'm not good at my job.

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I just know how to seduce them.

368
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I just know

369
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
that since you started your job,

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
no one has ever said

371
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
you're not good.

372
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Even if it's a professional

373
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
professional nutritionist.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So?

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So I don't allow myself

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to be

377
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
the one who's going to break your mouth.

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're right.

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Everyone has their own weakness.

380
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I have one too.

381
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's you.

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't care what others say.

383
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If it's true to me,

384
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm happy.

385
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But my behavior

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
won't be at the house

387
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
because of this.

388
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
My behavior is because

389
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
of my product.

390
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Not because I'm

391
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
your friend.

392
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I just like

393
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
a little girl.

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm not doing anything wrong.

395
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Why are you

396
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
always so nervous?

397
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let's go.

398
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let's go.

399
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm so happy.

400
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I didn't react.

401
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's go again.

402
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm so happy.

403
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What are you doing?

404
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm expressing my disappointment.

405
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm so happy.

406
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I told you,

407
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
the summer is really good.

408
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There's a lot of fun.

409
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I told you,

410
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
there's less time to work.

411
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There's a big beach over there.

412
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The gym.

413
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The photo is really good.

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There's a swimming pool.

415
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's really good.

416
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Did you two

417
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
go to the Las Vegas

418
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
to get married?

419
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You only came back this late?

420
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Brother Cheng.

421
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Since you're back,

422
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll tell you something.

423
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The club is not

424
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
allowing us to participate in the event.

425
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's really simple.

426
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm going to tell you

427
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that it's really simple.

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's a fan meeting.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll take it as a joke.

430
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Just be fun.

431
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Since Brother Cheng doesn't want to go,

432
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll just go to the basement.

433
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The basement?

434
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What?

435
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Where?

436
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The basement.

437
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If we don't go,

438
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
we'll miss the chance

439
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
to meet the food.

440
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We'll miss the chance

441
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
to meet the beautiful city.

442
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What a pity.

443
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What a pity.

444
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't...

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't.

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is our hotel

447
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
far from the night market?

448
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Has the activity been canceled?

449
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What time is the meeting?

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What time is the work?

451
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If we can get it,

452
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
it's bad if we can't get it.

453
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Don't take it off at that time.

454
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You said it's a million.

455
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Then we have to

456
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
tell Brother Cheng.

457
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Brother Cheng.

458
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Are you going?

459
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yes.

460
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes!

461
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's so good.

462
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes.

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm not going.

464
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Hurry up.

466
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I know how to play.

467
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I know how to play.

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I know how to play.

469
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You're playing with the vegetables.

470
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't have your vegetables.

471
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Stop.

472
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
My list.

473
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The order of the club

474
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
is a problem.

475
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We can clean the room at 8 p.m.

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Let's go.

477
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I just saw the screen.

478
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The hotel's

479
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
table is very high.

480
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How about we go for dinner?

481
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Let's go.

482
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's go.

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Let's go.

484
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Hurry up.

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Let's go.

486
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Brother Cheng.

487
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Help me bring the luggage.

488
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll go and hug my mom.

489
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Okay.

490
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll go and hug my mom.

491
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Hello, mom.

492
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes.

493
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We're already at the basement.

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's nice.

495
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's raining a little.

496
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't worry.

497
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll hang up.

498
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll hang up.

499
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Big sister.

500
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Are you Smiling?

501
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You are...

502
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's really you.

503
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm your fan.

504
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Fan.

505
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Before you quit your job,

506
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I really like to watch your live broadcast.

507
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I also play mid-term.

508
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I've learned a lot from you.

509
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I can play the team now.

510
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I can play a little more online.

511
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Maybe I'll meet you.

512
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
My dream is to play a game with you.

513
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Big sister.

514
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Can you sign a name for me?

515
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Okay.

516
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yang Yang.

517
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You're running around again.

518
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Why are you talking to strangers?

519
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Can you make people feel better?

520
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm not running around.

521
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I didn't talk to strangers.

522
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This little sister is my favorite computer player.

523
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What player?

524
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Computer.

525
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Okay, okay.

526
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What computer?

527
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Isn't it playing games?

528
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You kids.

529
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You're playing games.

530
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You're playing games.

531
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You're playing games.

532
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You're playing games.

533
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You're playing games.

534
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You're playing games.

535
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You're not slow at learning something.

536
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You're looking for some excuse for being cowardly.

537
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Let's go.

538
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Sister Smalone.

539
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I also want to get a job.

540
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I also want to win a title.

541
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I will be a champion in the national finals this year.

542
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm begging you!

543
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Goodbye, Sister Smalone.

544
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay, see you.

545
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Okay.

546
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Stop running around in the future.

547
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Why are you here?

548
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You've disappeared for 30 minutes.

549
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I thought you were kidnapped.

550
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I don't have money.

551
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I just got a job for three months,

552
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and I was deducted from three months.

553
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The assets are paid.

554
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I have money.

555
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
If you were to tie up a family,

556
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
what would you do with me?

557
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I have to give you 50,000 yuan.

558
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Who was that little ghost?

559
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
A little fan.

560
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What did you say?

561
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
He wanted to sign.

562
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He said he also wanted to get a job.

563
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But the career path was done by my mom.

564
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Let me ask you a question.

565
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Have I used up my money?

566
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't have money.

567
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't have money.

568
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't have money.

569
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't have money.

570
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't have money.

571
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't have money.

572
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't have money.

573
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't have money.

574
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I don't have money.

575
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I don't have money.

576
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I don't have money.

577
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't have money.

578
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't have money.

579
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't have money.

580
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't have money.

581
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I don't have money.

582
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't have money.

583
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't have money.

584
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Money is in etcetera's name.

585
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I am a confidant.

586
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What is it?

587
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,120
You want to get rid of it?

588
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,720
Actually, I don't have anything to ask.

589
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,800
How long have you been like this?

590
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,920
Just a short time.

591
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,040
It's a good hiding place.

592
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,200
No one found it.

593
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Who broke the famous Yuyi first?

594
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Me?

595
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
I threatened him.

596
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
If he didn't do it, I would throw him away.

597
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
So he did it.

598
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Are you satisfied with my answer?

599
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
You are wrong.

600
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
There is only one girl in the team.

601
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
We are bragging and protecting each other.

602
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
As the captain,

603
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
you are the captain.

604
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
We are not good at talking.

605
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
So you are the one who is bragging.

606
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I am not bragging.

607
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Then I will keep it for you.

608
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
I am the captain, not Lei Feng.

609
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
And you, Tong Yao.

610
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
You said you would do well in the career.

611
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
You didn't talk to the professional players.

612
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
The professional players are all in the team.

613
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
You are so self-centered.

614
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Captain is not a good guy.

615
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
He won't lie.

616
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
He usually watches the game.

617
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I feel more and more empty now.

618
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
I feel more and more

619
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
the smell of the mysterious dog food in the air.

620
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Why are you two so quiet?

621
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I don't know.

622
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
I just scolded him.

623
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I scolded him.

624
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Did you hear the Sider's brother's voice?

625
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,200
The game was so cute when I was playing in the supermarket.

626
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
It was so cute when I was playing the game.

627
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
I was defeated by Ata's early morning money.

628
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I was alone in the room.

629
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
I cried all night.

630
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
I practiced all night.

631
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
It was so cute.

632
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
I won the game.

633
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I didn't know what to say to the sun.

634
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
I didn't have the time to be polite.

635
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
So cute.

636
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
When Solo won the game,

637
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I felt more cute.

638
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I just asked.

639
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
I can still say a lot.

640
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
You stay in the school hall and talk to your wife.

641
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Don't you want to hear it?

642
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
The last question.

643
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Where are you two?

644
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Where are you two?

645
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
You only saw that.

646
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
There's nothing else.

647
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
What else do you want to ask?

648
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I'll tell you everything.

649
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
No, no, no.

650
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
You two let me play quietly.

651
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Go, go, go.

652
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
You two go first.

653
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Walk far away.

654
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Oh, right.

655
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
I used the spray.

656
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
I'm going to buy a spray.

657
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
No.

658
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Tell me what you want to say directly.

659
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
I'll go and spray you.

660
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I've been a assistant for two years.

661
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
You didn't even buy me a washbasin.

662
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Don't move tomorrow morning.

663
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Don't move.

664
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Don't move tomorrow morning.

665
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Bye bye.

666
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Bye bye.

667
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
After the V-log,

668
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
where are we going tomorrow?

669
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Where do you want to go?

670
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Go eat something delicious.

671
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Okay.

672
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Miss,

673
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,200
how are you going to sleep tonight?

674
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
What's up?

675
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
What are you doing?

676
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
I just finished my face mask.

677
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
I woke up early that day.

678
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I'm so sleepy.

679
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I think I can sleep anytime.

680
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Close the door.

681
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Put a stool in front of me.

682
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Close the door?

683
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Do you want to lock the thief or lock you?

684
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Lock me.

685
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Okay, I won't talk about it.

686
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
I'll hang up.

687
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Bye bye.

688
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
My private life

689
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
has been filled with your doggy days.

690
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
I'm still my assistant.

691
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Have you finished?

692
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
I remember

693
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
the excitement of

694
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
the young lady

695
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
in the hotel hall today.

696
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
I can't calm down

697
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
for a long time.

698
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I just want to beat you up.

699
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I'm a teammate of Tong Yao.

700
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
But you want to commit a crime.

701
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Brother Cheng,

702
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Tong Yao is very good.

703
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Look at God Yang,

704
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
look at Guang,

705
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
look at Li Hengshuo.

706
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
They are all like our family.

707
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
If we didn't win the game,

708
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
they would probably not come to do it.

709
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
If you have any problems,

710
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
please contact me.

711
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
The OPL team

712
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
is half of the team.

713
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
You have to be careful.

714
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Don't forget

715
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
that Xia Lu has a big me.

716
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
You are so lucky.

717
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
What do you want to say?

718
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Brother Cheng,

719
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
your competitor

720
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
is quite a lot.

721
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Don't think that you are a man.

722
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Just keep it.

723
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
I didn't keep it.

724
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
When I was with him,

725
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I wanted to tell the whole world.

726
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
There was someone behind me,

727
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
but he didn't let me.

728
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Why didn't you let him?

729
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
At first, I didn't think it was good.

730
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
I was afraid that he would lose.

731
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
But then I found out

732
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
that he has already got the recognition.

733
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Now, if we want to jump out again,

734
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
he can't do this, that can't.

735
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
That's just hitting his own face.

736
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,200
The OPL team has all won the record.

737
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
It means that Tong Yao has perfectly recognized

738
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
our position in the middle

739
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
and followed our rhythm.

740
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
But then,

741
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
when I was at my doorstep,

742
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
how did I tell this thing?

743
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
The OPL team

744
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
and Qingyang had a fight.

745
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
It was a big deal.

746
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
My fans

747
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
were also

748
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
very enthusiastic about this competition.

749
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
They were even more impressed by him.

750
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
He always thinks that

751
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
if I don't show him my true colors,

752
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,200
he will lose his fans.

753
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Little girl,

754
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
you are so thoughtful.

755
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Is the new one useful?

756
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Yes.

757
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
You are so thoughtful.

758
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
You are so thoughtful.

759
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
I am not the one who is giving you the gift.

760
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Brother Cheng,

761
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
what do you like about Tong Yao?

762
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
To be honest,

763
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Tong Yao

764
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
is just a normal girl.

765
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
I think

766
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
she is a girl

767
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
who can pull out

768
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
and support

769
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
her fans

770
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
who are not as good as you.

771
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Because she is very strong,

772
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
she is very eyes-catching.

773
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
She is also very cute.

774
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
She is a pervert.

775
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
She is also very handsome.

776
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
She is also very beautiful.

777
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Is there anything else?

778
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
I will try my best.

779
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
So, can I call you Brother Cheng?

780
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Who will you miss again?

781
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
This is the one.

782
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
I don't know what to do.

783
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I will sleep here.

784
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
I will sleep here.

785
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Your man is judging your voice.

786
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Listen to it.

787
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
It is noisy.

788
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Hurry up.

789
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Thank you.

790
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I don't know what to do.

791
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I don't know what to do.

792
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I don't know what to do.

793
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I don't know what to do.

794
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I don't know what to do.

795
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
You are really angry?

796
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Give me back your room.

797
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Let me see if there are any others.

798
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
No, no.

799
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
I am the only one.

800
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Then why are you

801
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
so naughty?

802
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Do you have any work to do?

803
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
What?

804
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I was wearing a mask last night,

805
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
okay?

806
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Love is the main character.

807
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
You are going to kill me?

808
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Aren't you going out with Ai Jia today?

809
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Why haven't you answered the phone?

810
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
I am not going.

811
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Why?

812
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Actually,

813
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
I have thought about this question carefully these days.

814
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
I think they are right.

815
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Which one?

816
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Who do you want to attack?

817
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
No.

818
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I am serious.

819
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
I am not like you.

820
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I am not as good as the other players.

821
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
In the fans' eyes,

822
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
I am not a person

823
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
who can help Ai Jia.

824
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I am not as good as the other players.

825
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
I am not as good as the other players.

826
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
You are playing a game.

827
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
You are not as good as the other players.

828
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
I can play a game.

829
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
But I can do something else.

830
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
For example,

831
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
for example,

832
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I bought her a team.

833
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I bought her a company.

834
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
When she saw the fans,

835
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
she would think,

836
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
wow, such a handsome man.

837
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Every hair color

838
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
is the one

839
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
that the woman who hates

840
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
bought her a company.

841
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
But I can't let her not want a company.

842
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
What should I do?

843
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
I can't.

844
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I am so angry.

845
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I am happy to have a rich man.

846
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
I don't deserve Yong Yong.

847
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
I like them.

848
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
They hate me.

849
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
They don't want to kill me.

850
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Are you serious?

851
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Maybe.

852
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
By the way,

853
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
don't you know that you are going to Vlog today?

854
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Go and dress up

855
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
for me.

856
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Don't be embarrassed.

857
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Okay.

858
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Bye.

859
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Bye.

860
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
We just finished the meeting.

861
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
The fans in the next room

862
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
are really enthusiastic.

863
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Now,

864
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
we are going to have dinner

865
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
in the small world.

866
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
I don't know

867
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
where they are going.

868
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
I will find

869
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
your favorite brother.

870
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Where is brother Cheng?

871
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Where is brother Cheng?

872
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Where is brother Cheng?

873
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Where is brother Cheng?

874
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Hu Xiao.

875
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
What is this smell?

876
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
It's pork.

877
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Xiaobang is taking a photo.

878
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
What should we do?

879
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
It's not a live broadcast.

880
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Don't worry.

881
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
I will delete it later.

882
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Delete it.

883
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
What do you mean?

884
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I can't keep it on my mind?

885
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Tell me.

886
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
How are you going to get married?

887
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
What do you want to do?

888
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
I think

889
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
it's not going to be a good thing

890
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
without the pig's stomach.

891
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Welcome to the shop.

892
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
We have a lot of snacks.

893
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
You can choose.

894
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
What would you like?

895
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
We can choose.

896
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Okay.

897
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
This is a harvest.

898
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
harvest.

899
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
harvest.

900
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
We are here to buy snacks for Xiao Pang.

901
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Aren't you afraid of the fat man?

902
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Don't worry.

903
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
Our snacks are all good ingredients.

904
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
They are delicious and not fat.

905
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Do you hear me?

906
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Please take two pieces of pork belly for us.

907
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Thank you.

908
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Okay.

909
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Mango.

910
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
I want to eat.

911
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
You are like a rabbit.

912
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Give it to me.

913
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
I won't give it to you.

914
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Give it to me.

915
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
You are so arrogant.

916
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
You are bullying me.

917
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
You are so jealous.

918
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Give it to me.

919
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
I won't give it to you.

920
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Give it to me.

921
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
I won't give it to you.

922
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
I won't give it to you.

923
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
I won't give it to you.

924
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
This is two pieces of pork belly.

925
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Thank you.

926
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Thank you.

927
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
You can take your time.

928
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
If you need anything, you can ask me.

929
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Okay.

930
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Give it to me.

931
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
You are so jealous.

932
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Li Kai.

933
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Come out.

934
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Hello.

935
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Who are you looking for?

936
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Where are you from?

937
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
You little brat.

938
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
You little brat.

939
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Come over here!

940
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
You little brat.

941
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
If you don't answer my call,

942
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
I won't answer your call.

943
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Come on.

944
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
I've been here so many times.

945
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Where are you from?

946
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
You are a bastard!

947

Go to final совершенно

960
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,000
Get out of here

961
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,440

Hurry!

963
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Love never needs a girlfriend

964
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,700
I want to get close to you, a little bit closer to you

965
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,700
A face without a face, a calm smile

966
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Heart beats are always at home

967
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,200
Never want to be addicted to the light, the information

968
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,200
The world is me and you, the first and the last

969
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:32,200
You think I'm a good person, I'm thinking about you

970
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,700
I want to get close to you, a little bit closer to you

971
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,700
A face without a face, a calm smile

972
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,700
Heart beats are always at home

973
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,200
Never want to be addicted to the light, the information

974
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,200
The world is me and you, the first and the last

975
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:02,200
You think I'm a good person, I'm thinking about you

976
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,200
I want to get close to you, a little bit closer to you

977
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,200
The world is me and you, the first and the last

978
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:19,200
You like me, I'm going to take your hand

979
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Love never needs a girlfriend

980
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I want to get close to you, a little bit closer to you

981
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,200
A face without a face, a calm smile
