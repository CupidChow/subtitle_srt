1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,960
Hello, I'm Li Junhe.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,080
Hello, I'm Li Junhe.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,320
I've been asked repeatedly

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,360
whether you're the first AD

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,440
or the chief of the world.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,000
This is so disturbing.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,960
I should give you a chance

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,360
to see it clearly

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,520
and defeat it in its place.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
If possible,

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,160
I hope you can

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,400
use the tears you got

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,360
when you were in the Pungji Cup.

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,040
Did he say that?

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,920
Is there any problem

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,560
in the world's low-end AD?

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,520
It's the same answer as my 800 times.

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
I...

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,320
You're so smart.

21
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,520
What's so good about it?

22
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,080
This woman is so arrogant.

23
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,880
I'll give her some color.

24
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,840
Let her understand

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,080
that the world of the man

26
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,240
is the end of the world.

27
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,760
She dares to say that?

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,160
I'm so worried.

29
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,800
I want to see

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
how powerful she is.

31
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm indeed a great

32
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,880
player in the Pungji Cup.

33
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,520
I hope she won't be

34
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,600
in the Pungji Cup.

35
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,400
Let her know

36
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,520
what it means to be a man

37
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,800
and to be a water.

38
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,680
My play is mine.

39
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,360
Her play is mine, too.

40
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,840
Is that really what you said?

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
No.

42
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,240
No.

43
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,280
Give.

44
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,720
I'll give her a choice.

45
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,160
Let her stay at home.

46
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,200
What home?

47
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,720
Everyone knows

48
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,080
ZDX is a double-edged sword.

49
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,720
I heard that Ou Erda won't go.

50
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,760
He'll be on the list

51
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,000
and get a cold war.

52
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,320
You're so childish.

53
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,480
You want to die, right?

54
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,520
Who told you that

55
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,120
I'll get a cold war

56
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,720
and get a cold war

57
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,320
and get a cold war

58
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,360
and get a cold war?

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,760
Team Chou

60
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,420
Team Dong

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,920
Team Tiger

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,880
Team Tiger

63
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Team Tiger

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,560
Team Tiger

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
Team Tiger

66
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,000
Team Tiger

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Team Tiger

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The Story of the Dead

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Episode 1

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Who said that the old man can't make you calm down?

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's in the 80s, he's in the 80s, he's in the 80s.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to give you a big shout.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're so good at talking nonsense.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Exactly.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Who are you talking to?

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're really a little fat ghost.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's your problem?

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So fierce.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Come on, the B-Ping game is starting.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Everyone, bring your headphones.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Old man, don't be so hasty.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's about to start.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, here it comes.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Here it comes.

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hurry up.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hurry up.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello, everyone.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is the final match of the 2020 National Final.

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm Dutou.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm Cheng Yang.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Today's game is about YQCB and ZGDS.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So today's final is both sides fighting.

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a great start.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you for your support for this match.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's cheer up and look forward to the final tonight.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've moved the bath money first.

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think Tong Yao should choose the bath money.

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The bath money is being moved again.

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tong Yao seems to be in the game.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Have you ever taken a bath money?

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
One more time.

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He Lan.

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He Lan.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're so clear about the bath money.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I haven't forgotten it yet.

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's over.

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's over.

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Tong Yao is quite good.

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If it's me, I'll be afraid of her bath money.

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll move it safely.

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Move the bath money.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Is this a good family?

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I told you to move the bath money.

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If we can't move it,

116
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
she can't keep up with these things.

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
After moving the bath money,

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
she moved the bath money.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I haven't played with the bath money for so long.

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are they still thinking about it?

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Little brothers.

122
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Your secret work is not good enough.

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Brother Cheng.

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Did you just be

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,000
set up by your secret?

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You accidentally lost your mouth.

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How else would they know

128
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to get the face-to-face weapon today?

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Can you get into the final?

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Are you a fool?

131
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Besides,

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you haven't got the face-to-face weapon for so long.

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Everyone knows you left a big scene.

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We set up a joke before.

135
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Do you think he will get hurt?

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When we were in the field today,

137
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
he blocked me like a warm-up.

138
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He didn't want to be hit by a pull.

139
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You are quite upset.

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course.

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He is such a good person.

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He blocked me like a thief.

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He is so heartless.

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's time for the final.

145
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Can you guys be serious?

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is it time to free up your lost machine?

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Come on.

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's move the police.

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The other side is going back to the border.

151
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He moved a fan.

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Looks like the YQCB

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
is not treating ZCDX well this time.

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The two of them are both

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
being killed by the two cops.

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes.

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But ZCDX is not

158
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
a weak bandit.

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They are being killed by the police.

160
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And YQCB is being killed by the police.

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The fire is a bit strong.

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Where are you going?

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yibo.

164
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When my dad jumps on you and scares you,

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you will be hit by a pull.

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Every time.

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Just search.

168
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You will know when you search.

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's take the little wild boar first.

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The boss is opening the field.

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He is the main instructor.

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is he the boss?

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No.

175
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hit him.

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You are so fast.

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are eating too much, little fat.

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You are so fast.

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You are so fast.

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I didn't even get my hair done.

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You...

182
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You are so fast.

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You are going to kill yourself.

184
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What are you doing here?

185
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why don't you just

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
hang up the other side of the dead?

187
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I am going to help you.

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You are so fast.

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You are so fast.

190
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are so fast.

191
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are so fast.

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I am telling you.

193
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This one

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
is the boss.

195
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
When the fat man walks into the river,

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
he will be gone by the next round.

197
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Kei.

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's go to the top first.

199
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will carry this.

200
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Carry what?

201
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You didn't hear that

202
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
our team has two people on the top.

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You are still calling Kei to help.

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You don't know how to be shy.

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are still shy to say others.

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Stand up quickly.

207
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The team is about to be eliminated.

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
According to the habit of the instructor,

209
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
he must be killed several times before he gets excited.

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Even if he is blind,

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
he will call the jungle to help him.

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I am going to go to the top.

213
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Come and squat.

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Coming.

215
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Brother.

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't let the two-killers go.

217
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The team is not ready to survive.

218
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They didn't even get the training.

219
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They feel sorry for them.

220
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can feel their eyes

221
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
being covered by the tears.

222
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They are all covered by the tears.

223
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Didn't you try to

224
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
sweep the jungle?

225
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was trying to lure the instructor

226
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to chase me.

227
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who knew he wouldn't be there?

228
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He is not a fool.

229
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How can you lie to him?

230
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We can win

231
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
if we lie to the instructor.

232
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Be careful.

233
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The other team is also going to be attacked.

234
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hurry up and catch the little wind.

235
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The three-level tower is full of air.

236
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The instructor is being picked up.

237
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will go first.

238
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I will go to the tower later.

239
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't go up first.

240
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will go up.

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The enemy is going to attack again.

242
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Look.

243
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The enemy is going to be in trouble

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
if the enemy is coming down.

245
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The instructor is going to attack the tower first.

246
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The instructor wants to attack the tower first.

247
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The team is going to use their left hand to save the little wind

248
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
to escape.

249
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
After the instructor enters the tower,

250
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the tower is hit and the tower is blood-sucking.

251
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He can only escape.

252
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I told you

253
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
not to do anything rashly.

254
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The instructor was almost left

255
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
just now.

256
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The tree soul is dead in two seconds.

257
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If the tree soul is dead,

258
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
he won't be hurt that badly.

259
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He is the master of the tower.

260
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If he is hurt,

261
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
he will be fine.

262
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He will die.

263
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Will our instructor

264
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
be lost in the jungle?

265
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
My wild monster.

266
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The instructor is stealing things.

267
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I will go and help him.

268
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I will go.

269
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Go.

270
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The right-hand grass is chasing.

271
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You can control the tower directly.

272
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The tree soul is following you.

273
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I can only go up.

274
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The tree soul is not hurt.

275
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The tower is injured.

276
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The two-story building is in the temple.

277
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The instructor and the instructor

278
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
are playing together.

279
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's beautiful.

280
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The whole game of this game

281
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
tells us

282
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
not to take the initiative to do things.

283
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Those who do things

284
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
will pay a terrible price.

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why?

286
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Look, the tower is broken.

287
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There is a head.

288
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's not enough to lead to the other side.

289
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The middle and lower part should be stable.

290
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's not certain.

291
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
A player who is a fighter

292
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
will find a chance to fight in the fight.

293
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's against him.

294
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But you think

295
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
there is a little advantage

296
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and a little kill.

297
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's why you should do it.

298
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No way.

299
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Look.

300
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Zifan,

301
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you can hit the tower

302
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
with your blood.

303
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Zifan, you want to ask the tower to kill you.

304
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let him be killed by the tower.

305
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let him be killed by the defense.

306
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let him be killed by the tower.

307
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Let him be killed by the tower.

308
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Zifan, you can kill Zifan.

309
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Zifan, you have enough blood.

310
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Go.

311
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Go.

312
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Zifan, you want to retreat.

313
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But the tower

314
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
can't escape from the side.

315
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Zifan, you are behind.

316
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The so-called three major mistakes in life.

317
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have a advantage.

318
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can carry.

319
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I can't fight.

320
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't be impulsive.

321
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Impulsive is to pay a price.

322
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's see if they

323
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
can resist you.

324
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't tell me

325
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
that you are so impulsive.

326
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you.

327
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But when is the little wolf dog

328
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
so hard?

329
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's okay to be the wolf dog.

330
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's okay to be the wolf dog.

331
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's okay to be the wolf dog.

332
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The game is over.

333
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's really sad

334
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to be in the game.

335
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Not only the opponent

336
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is being killed by the mid-nigh

337
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and the enemy is being targeted.

338
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They can't even eat the ice.

339
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
After five minutes,

340
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the game is only half of the middle.

341
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Although the chasm

342
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
has a little advantage in the cs,

343
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
it looks like

344
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
the enemy is

345
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
killed by the enemy.

346
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There is no way to escape.

347
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's too bad.

348
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm in the middle of the battle.

349
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're going up and down.

350
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's retreat.

351
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Little Fatty, go help him.

352
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay. I'll go get him.

353
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't worry.

354
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The enemy is starting to play.

355
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Is it strong?

356
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
No. Not strong.

357
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No team.

358
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The game is over.

359
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

360
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay.

361
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They are coming this time.

362
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You know it again.

363
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Smiling.

364
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If you want to play,

365
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you can't.

366
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's finish this game.

367
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's play the Chinese team.

368
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't let Smiling play.

369
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Or I'll be in trouble.

370
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Who is talking about the game?

371
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They want to play with a little color.

372
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's not me anyway.

373
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We can't see that

374
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
YQCB has finished the game.

375
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
They are coming to the middle.

376
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If they are so strong,

377
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it's a shame.

378
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They want to play the team.

379
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Clear the ice line.

380
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't fight.

381
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
My god.

382
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Smiling is starting the team.

383
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We can't play.

384
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why are you going in the left and right?

385
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm in control. We can play.

386
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The team is being sealed.

387
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You can go.

388
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let's hit them,เจяз Mitteur.

389
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's take them.

390
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,040
Take all the littol babies out.

391
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,000
T 43, T 43, T 43, T 33, T 33.

392
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:34,800
L

393
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,840
Nice.

394
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm so happy.

395
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,560
Good.

396
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,040
Good.

397
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm so happy.

398
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm so happy.

399
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
Brother Cheng, I...

400
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
How did I tell you before?

401
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,800
Leave it to me.

402
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
Relax.

403
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,080
Hurry up.

404
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm going up.

405
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,680
Great Snake.

406
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,160
Go.

407
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,960
Take a step.

408
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,000
Hit the Great Snake again.

409
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,920
Let's find a way to take a step.

410
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,680
OK.

411
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,160
Come on.

412
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm coming, Mr. Fatty.

413
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,400
Go.

414
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,360
Go.

415
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Go.

416
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,640
I'm ready.

417
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,880
Look at you, Mr. K.

418
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,640
Go.

419
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,560
After that,

420
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,240
the old man on the ZGDX

421
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,800
followed him.

422
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,640
And the old man and the smiley

423
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,480
and the little fat men

424
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,600
also chased him from the front.

425
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,760
YQCB is going to be attacked.

426
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,400
The ZGDX

427
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,920
has been forced to change the path.

428
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,600
They have taken down the Great Snake.

429
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,440
What's going on?

430
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,240
What's going on?

431
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,160
YQCB is going to be shot.

432
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,960
The Great Snake is going to be shot.

433
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,600
The Great Snake is going to be shot.

434
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,760
The Great Snake is going to be shot.

435
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,560
The ZGDX is going to be shot.

436
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
Shochu looks for the ground line.

437
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,120
Look for the sets.

438
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,440
The Great Snake is ready.

439
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
YQCB is trying to help us go down.

440
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,840
Hide in our housingective's housing sometimes.

441
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,640
Get down!

442
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,720
The great snake

443
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:56,480
has finally returned to the

444
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Go!

445
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,200
You're so amazing!

446
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
Here it comes again!

447
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,520
The match is over!

448
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,800
The match is over!

449
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
The match is over!

450
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,400
The match is over!

451
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,920
Congratulations to the champion of the match!

452
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,040
That's great!

453
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Yao Yao won!

454
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,160
She's the champion of the national team!

455
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,680
Calm down!

456
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,120
She's got a lot of ears.

457
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
That's just the beginning.

458
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,480
She's in a hurry.

459
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,560
Besides, the first match,

460
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,160
the girl's mentality is unstable.

461
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
Don't be too happy.

462
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,600
The first match.

463
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,560
Are you nervous?

464
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,400
Let's go.

465
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
The national finals of the national team

466
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,880
of the national team of the national team

467
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,480
is about to begin.

468
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,160
Here,

469
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,680
I'd like to thank the famous OUPU.

470
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,280
OUPU.

471
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,560
For lighting up your comfortable life

472
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
and lighting up your champion moment.

473
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,680
The first match,

474
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,200
although the ZGDS is a victory,

475
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,080
Smiling was obviously suppressed in the previous match.

476
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,400
So, let's see what kind of

477
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,720
spirit they will bring out in this match.

478
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Yes, let's look forward to it.

479
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Smiling chose the ghost white.

480
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,360
Who's more cowardly than the Ai Jia Bi?

481
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,720
I bet 10 yuan.

482
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,280
It must be good.

483
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,240
I'll pay 10 yuan.

484
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,840
I'll pay 20 yuan.

485
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,840
I'll pay

486
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
a bunch of shameless people.

487
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,640
The ZGDS's mid-level position.

488
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,040
Smiling chose the ghost white

489
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,920
with a lower quality.

490
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
The person who chose the ghost white

491
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,520
is the girl who's really good at it.

492
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,040
Let's see.

493
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,280
She really has improved a lot.

494
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,800
Good.

495
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,040
You're really good.

496
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,680
You're better than me.

497
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,360
What's the rite?

498
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Selling based on fate.

499
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,080
Selling based on fate.

500
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,720
Selling based on fate.

501
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:06,080
Selling based on fate.

502
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,040
What kind of voice did I switch to?

503
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,720
You're quite shocked.

504
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,960
ør checks your face.

505
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,520
Sister.

506
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,720
What kind of voice is that?

507
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,040
Can I try to trick a Yi-Xian?

508
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,600
Here it comes.

509
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:20,960
We can see that

510
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,000
K can still be in the lower lane

511
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,800
and play well.

512
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,400
Don't chase him.

513
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
The enemy team is coming.

514
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,240
Can you trick a Yi-Xian?

515
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,800
Yes.

516
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,840
K, go.

517
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,240
Go.

518
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,320
My Yi-Xian is in the game again.

519
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,920
The second place.

520
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,960
Congratulations to the team.

521
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,320
He's like a Yi-Xian.

522
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,800
He can trick a Yi-Xian.

523
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,960
There are only the team members.

524
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,880
He's so easy to trick a Yi-Xian.

525
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,520
He's really good.

526
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,600
I told you.

527
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,880
You can trick a Yi-Xian.

528
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,760
Only Brother Cheng.

529
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,320
Yes.

530
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,040
They said the enemy team is here.

531
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,640
They can't go up.

532
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
They're still going up.

533
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Are you stupid?

534
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
I can.

535
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
You can trick a Yi-Xian.

536
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,720
You can trick a Yi-Xian.

537
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,600
You can trick a Yi-Xian.

538
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Does your face hurt?

539
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,560
Do you have any words to say to him?

540
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,280
I can only say to you.

541
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,120
You're so stupid.

542
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,520
Today, the Yi-Xian

543
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,000
has a successful trick.

544
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,160
Compared with your brother,

545
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,080
your brother is really kind.

546
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
What?

547
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,400
What's going on?

548
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
They want to attack with verdicts.

549
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
But Rongrong inclined and knew

550
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,520
he was trying to escape.

551
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,320
He was very cautious.

552
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,040
In that case,

553
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
I cant find

554
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,320
such a suitable chance.

555
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,800
Get off the pressure.

556
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,320
Guiqi shows up this time.

557
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,480
Like a chore making the draw.

558
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,040
They want to evade now.

559
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,680
That's a waste!

560
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,400
Guiqi's suitable specialieni

561
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,040
is really fighting again.

562
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,200
We will save the boys.

563
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,460
YQD BTT on the line,

564
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,660
dual man helping 설명 and Xun

565
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,420
More left, brothers

566
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,180
Is it good?

567
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,540
I said yes

568
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,580
Look

569
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,080
They clearly fits

570
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,240
Wே arriving

571
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,940
не only hard but contribute

572
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,580
We need to example

573
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,060
for withdrawy

574
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,580
still can't

575
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,740
How insane!

576
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,080
The direction islaw.

577
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,060
похож BY robot!

578
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:39,480
D

579
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm not a pig.

580
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
If I lose later,

581
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:57,120
I'll go to the East South

582
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Don't talk nonsense

583
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
They are in the whole village

584
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
We have two towers

585
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Lao Meng, Xiao Fang, you count the towers

586
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Lao Ke, go to steal the snake with me

587
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Ok, I'm coming

588
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
No, go to steal the snake at this time

589
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
What if

590
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
What if you are discovered

591
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
This pot is the captain

592
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
It's too cold

593
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,120
If you want to say something to me

594
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Go to get the snake now

595
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
If you can get the snake

596
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
How to fight

597
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Otherwise

598
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Tao Yao, come on

599
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
Hurry up, brother Cheng

600
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Ready to steal the snake

601
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Rong Rong

602
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Chase is here

603
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
You can start to fight the snake

604
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,120
If he takes this snake

605
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
You can fight with the anti-aircraft gun

606
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Wait for the ACP to start to attack the snake

607
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
The sound is almost bleeding

608
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
ZGDX's three-person attack is coming

609
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
The support is coming

610
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Can you take it

611
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
ACP is on the battlefield

612
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
5-2

613
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
K and K

614
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
K is surrounded this time

615
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Yes, it's a bad time

616
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
K and K

617
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
K is not looking

618
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
The end

619
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
No

620
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
No

621
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
It's too late

622
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
This is

623
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Wait a minute

624
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Chase him

625
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
ACP is on the field

626
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
The team is eliminated

627
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Nice

628
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Nice

629
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
ACP is starting to attack the ground

630
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
The victory is certain

631
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
It's YQCB

632
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
This is the absolute accuracy

633
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
The YQCB field is so great

634
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Congratulations to YQCB team

635
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
I'm back

636
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
What's wrong

637
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
I'm worried about my gun

638
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Do you still remember

639
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
what I said when you just came

640
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Brother Cheng

641
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
What did you say

642
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
You said it too many times

643
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
I have to fall down

644
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
I'm afraid

645
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
I'm afraid

646
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
I'm afraid

647
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
I'm afraid

648
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
I'm afraid

649
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
I'm afraid

650
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
I'm afraid

651
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
I'm afraid

652
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
I'm afraid

653
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
I'm afraid

654
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm afraid

655
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm afraid

656
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
I'm afraid

657
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
I'm afraid

658
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
I'm afraid

659
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
I have to fall down

660
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
I remember it again

661
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
in the supermarket

662
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
ACP is the original sin

663
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,120
ACP is the original sin

664
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
So we have to win

665
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
next time

666
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Let's go

667
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Let's go

668
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,000
We are going to meet

669
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
Roy

670
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
You take us to meet

671
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,320
Eldest brother

672
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,120
After what I say

673
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Your business is intentional

674
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
It's been 3000 years

675
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
I don't know

676
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
What can I do

677
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
What type of

678
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
family did we meet

679
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,440
I miss you today.

680
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
See you at the stadium.

681
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,280
Fighting, Jizmen.

682
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,160
Fighting,

683
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,640
B.

684
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,480
Welcome back.

685
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,880
This is the final of the 2020

686
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Final of the match.

687
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,000
The winner is

688
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,040
ZGDX and YQCB.

689
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,280
The score is 1-1.

690
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,840
Both teams have won the game.

691
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,320
Now, the final match

692
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,080
of the 2020 Final of the match.

693
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,280
Okay, we've seen

694
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,520
both teams are ready to go.

695
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,000
The next match is

696
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,200
the BAMPIC match.

697
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,560
We should move the early game first.

698
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,080
We must move the early game.

699
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,880
We must move the early game.

700
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,080
Okay.

701
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,520
Hongyao's first early game

702
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,840
seems to be successful.

703
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,280
Hongyao's face is good.

704
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,120
ZGDX's

705
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,760
also got into the middle.

706
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,520
He's so nervous.

707
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,320
What are you thinking?

708
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
The next match is

709
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,600
the BAMPIC match.

710
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,240
The light and the face.

711
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,320
The BAMPIC match.

712
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,960
The opponent's face is really high.

713
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
The BAMPIC match.

714
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,240
The light and the face.

715
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
Okay, the next match is

716
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
the P1 match.

717
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,960
Let's see who will be the winner.

718
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,320
Yang Shen.

719
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,200
The third game is starting.

720
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,280
Do you see it?

721
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,000
Old Mao, can you give me a hint?

722
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,040
Okay.

723
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,840
Old K,

724
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
choose the black-and-white one for Xiaopang.

725
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Okay.

726
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,040
Zilei, I'll choose the red-and-white one.

727
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,840
Okay.

728
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,000
What do you need?

729
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,040
Help me get the white-and-white one.

730
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,080
You can ask for it.

731
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
Okay.

732
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Okay.

733
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,520
Chen,

734
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,920
you can choose this one.

735
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,120
Help me get the ten thousand-year-old one.

736
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,880
Okay, we've seen

737
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,440
that both teams have

738
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,600
a basic choice.

739
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:25,800
Yes.

740
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,040
The IQCB team

741
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,760
chose the nine-tun-tong

742
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,440
and the attack was very strong.

743
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,800
The mid-to-mid is the big-tong.

744
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,280
The jungle is the ten thousand-year-old.

745
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,720
The support team is the one-tun.

746
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,040
The archer is the white-and-white one.

747
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,880
It looks like

748
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,480
a relatively stable combination.

749
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,880
That's right.

750
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,160
The ZZD team

751
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,960
hasn't decided on the final god,

752
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,040
except for Smiling.

753
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,320
The other four people

754
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,880
have decided on their own.

755
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
You can see that the top position

756
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
of Old Mao

757
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,960
is the one with the nine-tun-tong.

758
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,280
The CPC is the one with the purple-and-white one.

759
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,760
Yes.

760
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,240
Old K is the one with the dark-and-white one.

761
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,440
The archer of Trissman

762
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,720
is the one with the black-and-white one.

763
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,960
And the support team of Xiaopang

764
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,040
is the one with the black-and-white one.

765
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,120
Let's see who

766
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,200
will be the winner of Smiling today.

767
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,840
Xiaopang,

768
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,400
choose the ghost.

769
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,480
Ghost?

770
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,080
Oh my god.

771
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,360
Smiling is actually a ghost.

772
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,800
Last time when the ZZDX

773
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,520
was fighting against YQCB,

774
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,080
Smiling was actually a ghost.

775
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,680
Yes.

776
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,960
If I remember correctly,

777
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,240
it seems like he was the winner last time.

778
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,760
That's right.

779
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,600
I guess Smiling

780
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,360
wanted to take revenge for this one-tun-tong.

781
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,640
Yes.

782
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,760
I think YQCB

783
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
is also thinking like this.

784
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,200
Look.

785
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,280
All the players' faces

786
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,520
are not so good.

787
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,720
They're probably thinking

788
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,080
that what are you doing?

789
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,280
I've been working hard.

790
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,400
You're three people.

791
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,520
You took out a ghost

792
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,960
and cut the game with me.

793
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,440
I...

794
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,920
I'm playing a fake game.

795
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,720
It's true.

796
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,400
Let's look forward to it together.

797
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,680
Okay.

798
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,280
Everyone, fighting.

799
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,880
Fighting.

800
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,680
Fighting.

801
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,920
Fighting.

802
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,280
Fighting.

803
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,240
Fighting.

804
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,960
Fighting.

805
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,520
Fighting.

806
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
You played nice this time!

807
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,760
You did fine.

808
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,080
Why are everything happening?

809
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,040
You're crazy MCB

810
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,360
peine

811
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,280
Who are you casting Beijing?

812
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,640
I feel like I'g released the most powerful team Durian

813
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,860
So fast

814
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,580
Here it comes.

815
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,340
The second match is coming.

816
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,140
You're ready to go.

817
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,860
The atmosphere is a bit tense.

818
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,380
Smiling is hiding under the tower.

819
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,140
He's not dare to go out.

820
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,980
Yes.

821
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,300
Feng Yao, I'll help you with this.

822
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,180
Come on, Lao Mao.

823
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,100
Be careful.

824
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
OK, I'll go.

825
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,500
Come on, the second match is coming.

826
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,220
Smiling's third-level attack on the face of the second match.

827
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,180
Smiling is out of control.

828
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,300
Lao Mao is rushing.

829
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,620
He's with Smiling.

830
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,660
Smiling is like a flower.

831
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,940
Smiling is in a hurry.

832
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,260
The second match is coming.

833
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,180
Smiling is out of control.

834
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,060
Nice.

835
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,940
Nice.

836
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,820
Nice.

837
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,220
Jia Chang, forget about the second match.

838
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,060
Lao Mao is out of control.

839
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,540
Come on, let's play a game.

840
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,340
OK, let's go.

841
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,220
The first two players in the game

842
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,060
are against each other.

843
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,980
Come on, we see that they're playing 10 games.

844
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,420
OK, 10 games are also played.

845
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,860
If I were the audience,

846
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,820
I should have gone to the third game.

847
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,900
You need to go first.

848
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,660
No danger.

849
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,140
Yes.

850
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,260
Young people need to know how to be stubborn.

851
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,540
I didn't do anything.

852
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,340
Why did you ask him?

853
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,940
Lu Si Cheng.

854
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,780
There are so many people on the back stage.

855
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,740
Can you shut up?

856
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,380
Brother, you can't let it go.

857
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,780
I don't want to be punished

858
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,300
by the dead.

859
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,980
And there are many young people in the fans.

860
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,020
What are you laughing at?

861
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,780
They're playing the big game.

862
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,620
You're not here to help.

863
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,060
I'm dead.

864
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,380
Who's going to be the rain?

865
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,260
Coming.

866
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,100
It's a day-to-day game.

867
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,020
It's been a while since we played this game.

868
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,340
They're all dead.

869
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,780
The whole circle of VQCB

870
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,820
is coming to the snake pit.

871
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,180
Why are they still waiting?

872
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,940
What are they waiting for?

873
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,860
Can they still get the snake?

874
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,700
Can they still do it?

875
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,460
The amount of blood of the snake

876
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,260
is only one-fourth.

877
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,020
It's not a good time to play.

878
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,060
It's almost there.

879
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,780
Let's wait a little longer.

880
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,580
Get ready.

881
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,220
Coming.

882
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,700
Go!

883
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,540
Go!

884
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,580
KO's hacked in.

885
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,780
HE has filled in

886
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,460
the lastoke of the MQCB.

887
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,620
KO has sent Snake.

888
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,580
He just chased him.

889
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,740
And he makes some cutting point.

890
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,260
It's not clear if they playing the red carpet.

891
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:44,780
Where's the羊?

892
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,860
Can't he see it that well?

893
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,580
In the first half,

894
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,940
I'm happy to see him

895
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,260
shining on the stage.

896
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,140
Although he was in the first year,

897
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,780
I didn't expect

898
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,620
he would take the same position as me.

899
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,780
He's cheap.

900
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,380
He's a good guy.

901
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,740
I like him

902
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,300
if I were a woman.

903
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,140
No problem.

904
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,100
Really?

905
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,860
Really?

906
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,220
I wish him well.

907
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,980
I'm sure he's going to win.

908
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,780
After all, he's the master of the master.

909
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,780
He's the champion.

910
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,300
But he's eliminated.

911
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,100
I wish him well.

912
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,180
The game has been 50 minutes.

913
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,020
It's the legendary

914
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,900
bright spot.

915
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Let's interview

916
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,060
Lu Si Cheng.

917
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
How do you feel?

918
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,900
It's okay.

919
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,580
If I lose for so long,

920
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
I'll be happy.

921
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,700
I can't.

922
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,580
Even if I think it's a finals,

923
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,980
even if I think of the ticket for the world championship,

924
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,980
even if I think of

925
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,380
traveling abroad for free,

926
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,180
I can't.

927
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,340
I'm so tired.

928
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,940
I'm serious.

929
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,100
I'm tired, too.

930
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,660
I've played for over 40 minutes.

931
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,060
I've been counting.

932
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,500
Now, I'm not a real man.

933
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,540
I'm a man.

934
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,380
Hang in there.

935
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,540
Hang in there for 10 minutes.

936
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,380
If I lose,

937
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,460
I'll be finished.

938
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,500
I don't care if I lose.

939
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,700
I'll just take one step.

940
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,740
Come on, fatso.

941
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,340
Sing a song.

942
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,340
Stand up.

943
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,540
One, two, three.

944
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,860
Come on,

945
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,940
let's make a deal.

946
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,740
We have a lot of time.

947
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,220
What deal?

948
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,820
Come on,

949
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,580
let's make a deal.

950
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,180
We have a lot of time.

951
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,060
Come on,

952
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,940
let's make a deal.

953
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,900
We have a lot of time.

954
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,820
Let's make a deal.

955
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,420
Come on,

956
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,020
let's make a deal.

957
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,300
We have a lot of time.

958
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,100
I really didn't expect

959
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,940
the song of GDX

960
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,820
that we dream of joining

961
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,260
is actually this.

962
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,340
You didn't expect that one day,

963
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,380
you'll be in the song

964
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,980
of the song of the other side of the wind.

965
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,100
What do you think?

966
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,660
The game is back.

967
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:04,940
Go.

968
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,580
Go.

969
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,860
GDX has a military line.

970
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,460
It's a high ground with a YQCB.

971
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,540
It's a strong ground.

972
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,060
Can you defend the GDX?

973
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,940
It's opening.

974
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,660
The wind is blowing.

975
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,860
Fatty, you can defend it.

976
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,500
It's okay.

977
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,140
I'll defend it.

978
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,180
Come on.

979
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,220
Don't pretend to be the king.

980
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,580
You're a good man.

981
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,660
Brother Cheng, you should be careful.

982
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,540
Go.

983
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,220
At this time,

984
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,100
you're going to be killed by the GDX

985
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,620
and take it away directly.

986
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,220
I can't believe

987
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,820
the GDX

988
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,180
is so powerful.

989
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,700
The GDX is a good song.

990
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,380
Give it to me.

991
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,580
The GDX is being killed by you.

992
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,460
The GDX is killed.

993
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,700
You're still trying to be the king.

994
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,900
Can you give it to the king?

995
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,700
You're so beautiful.

996
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,260
The king is killed.

997
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,860
Beautiful.

998
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,580
Okay.

999
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,420
Go on.

1000
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,220
No, I'm in trouble.

1001
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,580
Come on.

1002
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,820
I'm in trouble.

1003
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,940
I've got a chance.

1004
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,700
Brother Cheng.

1005
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,860
The GDX is really strong.

1006
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,380
Come on, Simeo.

1007
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:17,340
者,

1008
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,700
Tennac.

1009
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,380
You're so great.

1010
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,100
Leng Meng,

1011
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,580
get ready,

1012
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,220
and we're leaving.

1013
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,020
Retreat Vuunderaco!

1014
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,980
Get going!

1015
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,060
We're retreating!

1016
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,460
Okay, you can do it.

1017
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,260
Come on, come on, get it.

1018
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,940
There aren't many soldiers here.

1019
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,580
Go ahead.

1020
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,140
Take the soldiers first.

1021
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,780
Don't mind them.

1022
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,300
Fire the hole.

1023
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,580
Need more support.

1024
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,860
There are still nine seconds left.

1025
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,260
Can you see the blue light?

1026
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,380
We're on the move.

1027
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,220
Eight seconds.

1028
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Seven seconds.

1029
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,180
Six seconds.

1030
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,660
Five seconds.

1031
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,940
Four seconds.

1032
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,860
Three seconds.

1033
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,100
Eight seconds.

1034
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,180
Two seconds.

1035
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,420
One second.

1036
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,300
Two seconds.

1037
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,340
Get off of me, girl.

1038
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,100

1040
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,340
Listen to me!

1041
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Six seconds.

1042
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,460
Let me see the player, Xiaopang.

1043
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,140
合约,五刹人.

1044

I'm coming.

Five seconds.

1046
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:40,900
Five seconds.

1047
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,300
The world is helpless.

1048
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,220
Three times!

1049
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,820
Four seconds left.

One last time.

1051
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,740
Three times.

1052
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,620
Beautiful!

1053

Beautiful!

1054
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,940
We have a chance.

1055
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,780
Wait for me to revive.

1056
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,940
Brother Cheng, no.

1057
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,820
You can do it.

1058
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,540
You guys revive,

1059
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,300
you have to take a step back.

1060
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,020
You have to take a step back.

1061
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,220
You have to take a step back.

1062
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,020
You have to take a step back.

1063
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,220
You have to take a step back.

1064
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,100
You guys are in the four seconds.

1065
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,740
You have to rush to the top.

1066
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,100
The power of the magical sword and the sword.

1067

The golden dragon of the Jiao Khan.

1068

The world is helpless.

1069
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,460
Fantastic.

1070
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,380

Five seconds to go.

1125
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,080
The players of YKCB are about to be revived.

1126
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,800
Can we not let them down in the semi-finals?

1127
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,880
Let's see who wins the final round.

1128
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,040
There are so many rounds today.

1129
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,880
It's hard to predict the outcome.

1130
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,640
Don't arrest them for anything else.

1131
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,200

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,560
