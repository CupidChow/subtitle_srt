1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,110
What's the use of doing well in the qualifying season?

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,620
We still didn't make it to the finals

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,940
because of someone.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,920
In the end, we handed over the trophy to others.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,580
Who was responsible for God Ming's

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,780
severe hand injury?

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,550
Not all mistakes

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,990
can be covered up by time.

9
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,120
Lu Yue won't be in the starting lineup.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,550
Anyway,

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,070
it must be an inside job.

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,440
I posted the video.

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,000
Pang?

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,890
Why did you fight?

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,910
Why did you drag God Ming down?

16
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,350
Why did you have to implicate the team?

17
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,890
You're just a coward who always runs away!

18
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,430
Say that again!

19
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,310
I'll say it again!

20
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,840
You're a coward!

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,630
Pang, enough!

22
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,070
-Shut up!
-Say it again!

23
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,830
You're a coward!

24
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,330
-Alright, Pang, that's enough.
-Let's go.

25
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,190
Let's go cool off.

26
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,650
Pang, you've got it wrong.

27
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,000
Lu Yue didn't fight for no reason.

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,720
It's clearly Lu Yue's fault!

29
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,660
Why do you keep defending him?

30
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,170
The truth is often not on the surface.

31
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,130
Do you want to hear it?

32
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,510
What exactly happened a year ago?

[Episode 8]

35
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,229
Hey, yeah, I know.

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,080
Yao, don't hang up yet.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,090
Go watch Ai Jia's livestream.

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,690
He's clearing Lu Yue's name.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,730
It was quite a coincidence.

40
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,390
I happened to be in the restroom with an upset stomach at that time.

41
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,670
You have no idea

42
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,140
how despicable those guys from Team JK are.

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,930
Who does ZGDX think they are?

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,160
Why are they so arrogant?

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,829
They're too cocky!

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,760
Exactly.

47
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,329
Especially that Lu Yue.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,700
He didn't show up for his buddy's party tonight,

49
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,940
and yet he still dared to talk big.

50
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,570
He's clearly disrespecting A.

51
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,140
A spent a fortune.

52
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,010
He did it

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,890
just to promote before the match.

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,980
And what happened?

55
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,110
It was all livestreamed,

56
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,680
yet they beat us 2-0.

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Wasn't it a deal?

58
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:51,940
It's an exhibition match.

59
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,610
A 2-1 would've been enough.

60
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,440
It's one thing to not go along with it,

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,230
but they're even cocky.

62
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,090
The audacity!

63
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,980
Come to think of it,

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,810
if A hadn't been off his game today,

65
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,890
would we've lost?

66
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,760
Yeah!

67
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,070
They just got a free pass to the finals.

68
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,530
What are they cocky about?

69
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,280
Exactly!

70
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,110
They want to go to the national finals?

71
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,590
Dream on.

72
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,680
Since they dared to disrespect me,

73
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,590
I'll make sure

74
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,480
they get what they bargained for.

75
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,300
Hello?

76
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,660
Come over later.

77
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,420
Yeah,

78
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,710
bring more people.

79
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,910
Take care of those

80
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,020
uncooperative ZGDX guys for me.

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,460
Cripple all their hands.

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,720
Oh, and

83
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,480
be careful when you do it.

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,680
Don't hurt the second young master of the Lu family.

85
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,690
Wait, A,

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,110
why not cripple Lu's hands too?

87
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,910
We can't mess me

88
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,040
the Lu family.

89
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,310
About this fight,

90
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,930
A's side started it first.

91
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,020
His exact words were,

92
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,020
"Get people

93
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,300
to cripple those pro players' hands."

94
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,410
Who are those pro players?

95
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,260
It's ZGDX.

96
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,020
Guys,

97
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,850
they wanted to

98
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,540
cripple the hands of all ZGDX members.

99
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,400
And they weren't joking.

100
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,250
They'd already called for backup at that time.

101
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,459
If it were you,

102
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,040
in such a situation,

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,170
would you just sit back and do nothing?

104
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,140
And if they really brought people over,

105
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,820
it would've been too late.

106
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,340
Yes, that's the whole course of events.

107
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm only stating the facts,

108
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,010
without making judgments.

109
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,120
Take your time to process this.

110
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,540
Bye bye.

111
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,010
Lu Yue.

112
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,820
We're all buddies in the same team.

113
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,190
You shouldn't have kept it a secret

114
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,830
that you got into a fight to protect us.

115
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,680
There's one thing they're right about.

116
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,330
Your hand

117
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,110
was injured because of my fight after all.

118
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,440
Lu Yue.

119
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,900
Alright.

120
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,640
Now that everything's clear,

121
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,650
let's not dwell on the past anymore.

122
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,290
But your hand is injured.

123
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,590
I'm still responsible after all.

124
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,240
So even if I'd spoken up,

125
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,770
nothing would've changed.

126
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,600
Pang was right.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,320
I did hold you back

128
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,720
and hold the team back.

129
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,670
No matter what,

130
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,810
Lu Yue was impulsive for this.

131
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,310
Then it seems

132
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,470
we can't just blame everything

133
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,480
on Lu Yue.

134
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,870
In the end,

135
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,790
it's all because of the despicable A from Team JK.

136
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,760
Yeah! If I heard someone

137
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,550
was going to beat up my buddy,

138
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,910
I'd call for backup too.

139
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,660
Right?

140
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,550
So Lu Yue

141
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,440
can't be entirely blamed for this.

142
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,970
How can you think like that?

143
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,840
In such situations, we should call the police.

144
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,400
Yeah.

145
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,430
We should sue him until he's ruined!

146
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,570
Now that the truth is out,

147
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,590
K,

148
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,560
Pang,

149
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,110
are you two...

150
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,390
good now?

151
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,130
Lu Yue.

152
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,520
I was wrong.

154
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,270
I misunderstood you.

155
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,870
It's okay.

156
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,720
Cheng.

157
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,940
I think we should

158
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,840
officially release the truth first.

159
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,230
Even if we can't reverse public opinion,

160
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,500
we must at least let them know

161
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,360
that we didn't start the trouble.

162
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,210
I'll make a call to PR for help

163
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,210
to resolve this.

164
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,270
Lu Yue.

165
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,450
I'm sorry you were wronged.

166
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,820
I don't feel wronged.

167
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,680
I did take

168
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,370
the worst possible approach.

169
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,050
Gosh, bro.

170
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,120
You should've

171
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,680
contacted me immediately.

172
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,420
If I'd been there,

173
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,840
God Ming's hand would've been fine.

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,720
If you'd called me,

175
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,520
I would've gone there and—

176
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,850
And called the police right away.

177
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,560
Yeah?

178
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,840
Okay, all's good now.

179
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,390
Yo! Cheng's here!

180
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,360
I've finally made it to a ZGDX livestream!

181
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,950
I'm dying from curiosity.

182
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,010
Cheng, can you explain the fight incident?

183
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,630
Why did Lu Yue throw the first punch?

184
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,230
It's true that Lu Yue struck first.

185
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,290
As for why he did it,

186
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,420
you can watch Ai Jia's livestream.

187
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,200
You withdrew from the competition because of God Ming's injury.

188
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,470
That's why the fight happened, right?

189
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,870
Let's have a moment of silence for God Ming.

190
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,340
God Ming's injury was an accident.

191
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,140
You're right.

192
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,650
It is related to this.

193
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,430
But God Ming's hand was injured before.

194
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,740
This is common for pro gamers.

195
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,100
Tendon tears

196
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
are common for core players.

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,060
No matter what, Lu Yue was impulsive.

198
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,960
Cheng.

199
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,800
If it were you,

200
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,910
what would you've done?

201
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,510
I wouldn't have hit someone.

202
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,200
But I'd have made sure

203
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
that those who bullied my teammates

204
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,080
regret their actions.

205
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,590
Look.

206
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,670
My contract renewal with the club.

207
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,820
If you have time to show off,

208
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,440
you might as well expand your shikigami pool.

209
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,820
Speaking of which, shouldn't I get a fixed seat?

210
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
I can't keep fighting with this fool for the computer.

211
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,960
Am I right, God Ming?

212
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,640
It just shows

213
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,450
the difference in our status.

214
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,880
I meant adding a computer desk for you.

215
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,950
Pang has been busy in the kitchen since morning.

216
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,050
It's making me nervous.

217
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,770
What's he up to?

218
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,720
I bet

219
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,910
he's making dinner for everyone

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to apologize.

221
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,590
Pang.

222
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,760
I didn't know you were a good cook.

223
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,150
I've never been treated so well

224
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,080
all this time I've been in the team.

225
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,740
What do you need? I'll help you.

226
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,380
No need, no need.

227
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,500
Stay in your seats.

228
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,540
Rui.

229
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,080
I heard Pang was fined three months' salary this time.

230
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,090
That's harsh.

231
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,220
This means that for the next three months,

232
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,680
he might ask to borrow money from me anytime.

233
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,290
Can I choose not to eat this sadfishing meal?

234
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,850
I'll pass too.

235
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,820
Keep up with the sarcasm

236
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,930
and I'll dock your salaries.

237
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,130
-Okay, I'll eat.
-I'll eat.

238
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,580
I deserve it.

239
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,430
I deserve this.

240
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,940
Pang.

241
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,990
Even though you were fined,

242
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,280
if you're treating,

243
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,510
you could've at least bought more meat.

244
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,910
There's nothing here!

245
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,350
Yeah, where's the meat?

246
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,650
Then I'll have it.

247
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,140
No, no, no.

248
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,190
I'll eat. I'll eat.

249
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,020
I'll eat. I'll eat.

250
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,210
Let me look again.

251
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,050
Do you want some of mine?

252
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,980
Do you have meat?

253
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,930
A little bit.

254
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,280
What are you doing?

255
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,370
No way, Pang.

256
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,880
Hiding meat at the bottom of the bowl

257
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,160
for your favorite child?

258
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,910
I thought this went out of style

259
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,350
in my mom's generation.

260
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,680
I...

261
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,410
Look,

262
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,090
you made him mad.

263
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,880
Lu Yue, I'm sorry.

264
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,100
I shouldn't have accused you

265
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,390
without clarifying the situation.

266
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,740
Pang will break his room door down sooner or later.

268
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,100
That's settled then.

269
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,510
Back to the point.

270
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,490
Everyone's okay with Lu Yue

271
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,470
rejoining the team, right?

272
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,980
Yeah.

273
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,430
Then I'll submit the roster for the new season tomorrow.

274
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,230
Wait, what?

275
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,700
No objections?

276
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,660
How's everyone suddenly okay with this?

277
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,540
What about me?

278
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,390
I object.

279
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,060
New members always start as substitutes.

280
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,030
Really?

281
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,620
I've never played professionally. Don't try to fool me.

282
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,630
Lu Yue is right.

283
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,870
Back then, Cheng also started

284
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,270
as a substitute.

285
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,710
But it took him just a year

286
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,420
to make that player

287
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,620
tremble on the substitute bench.

288
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,250
Let me correct that.

289
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,380
That person didn't actually tremble.

290
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,840
If you want to make me tremble,

291
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,060
that's impossible.

292
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,470
Oh, shut up, will you?

293
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,750
Who exactly was pushed to the substitute bench

294
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,710
and made to tremble?

295
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,510
The Pope.

296
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,980
The Pope?

297
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,420
From TAT?

298
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,560
My brother and the Pope

299
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,380
were once substitutes for each other.

300
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,900
The strongest light and shadow in OCK history.

301
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,830
Let's eat.

302
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,310
Are you trying to convince me or what?

303
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,800
It's to tell you

304
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,310
that true talent will always shine.

305
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,790
Look at Cheng and the Pope,

306
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,360
right?

307
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,730
They're equally respected,

308
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,190
each dominating a league.

309
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,740
You know,

310
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,990
all damage dealers

311
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,620
have to cower and tremble under

312
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
their dominance.

313
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,510
The shadow that rolls on the ground after being defeated by Tai once.

314
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,510
I don't want that.

315
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,780
Watch your words.

316
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,740
Say that again.

317
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,860
I won't.

318
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,590
Then you say it.

319
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,310
Say what?

320
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,710
Your brother's trying to walk all over me.

321
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,130
First come, first served.

322
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,780
Who told you to rejoin the team so late?

323
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,770
Besides, her shikigami pool

324
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,230
is much deeper than yours.

325
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,490
You'd better behave.

326
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,100
Why are you speaking up for her?

327
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,360
None of your business.

328
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,430
Did you hear that, huh?

329
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,980
First come, first served.

330
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,860
My shikigami pool is deep.

331
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,410
And you're just a noob!

332
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,410
You keep quiet too.

333
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,310
Both of you

334
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,010
haven't been in any official matches.

335
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,630
Just in case,

336
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,690
isn't it normal to have a substitute?

337
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
If you two want starting positions,

338
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,930
earn them with your skills.

339
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,220
Great! That's wonderful.

340
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,090
I really respect Cheng's suggestion this time.

341
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,300
Come to think of it,

342
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,830
this is truly

343
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,110
the fairest treatment I've ever seen.

344
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,830
Really.

345
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,450
One, two, three, four.

346
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,609
Five, six, seven, eight.

347
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,720
Two, two, three, four.

348
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,780
Five, six, seven, eight.

349
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,839
Three, two, three, four.

350
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,940
Five, six, seven, eight.

351
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,440
Four, two, three, four.

352
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,290
Five, six, seven, eight.

353
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,670
Five, two...

354
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,550
Cheng.

355
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,670
As the team captain, you should set a good example.

356
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,660
I have near-perfect vision.

357
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,590
From here, I can see

358
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,020
which episode of what Korean drama

359
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,830
the opposing team is watching.

360
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,430
With my excellent eyesight,

361
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,730
do I need to do that?

362
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,870
Seven, two, three, four.

363
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,360
While I was away,

364
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,140
ZGDX's really transformed so much.

365
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,140
A family should be neat and tidy.

366
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,020
Is this the new computer the club sent for you?

367
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,590
Yup!

368
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,820
I no longer have to fight with that fool.

369
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,860
What era are we in?

370
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,870
You're still doing eye exercises?

371
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,940
I bought everyone eye protection lamps.

372
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,780
Now, no matter how long you stare at the computer,

373
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,710
you won't have to worry about eye strain.

374
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,390
One for everyone,

375
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,300
so use it.

376
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,420
That's quite thoughtful.

377
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,350
Of course.

378
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,190
Fool!

379
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,650
Come over here.

380
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,660
Moron.

381
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,030
You come over.

382
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,190
Shorty, how long are you going to practice?

383
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,150
I'll stop

384
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,430
when you stop.

385
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,680
I'll stop

386
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,820
when you stop.

387
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,900
Why are you copying me?

388
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,310
Why are you copying me?

389
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,330
Hey, how are things with you and Ai Jia?

390
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,900
Looks like you've made up?

391
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,080
I've put him on my probationary boyfriend list.

392
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,120
Let's see how he performs.

393
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,830
You've been together for six years,

394
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,700
and he's been on probation six times

395
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,160
and never been kicked off.

396
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,650
I'll shut up.

397
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,460
The new season's promo photos and schedule are out.

398
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,390
Check it out.

399
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,350
What is it?

400
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,970
The National League needs promo photos.

401
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,260
National League?

402
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,100
The one you're going to host.

403
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,360
That National League.

404
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,460
Hey.

405
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,220
Shouldn't you

406
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,420
know a little about your part-time job?

407
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,990
Don't I just need to look stunning for it?

408
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,590
I don't need to know all that.

409
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,410
Your No.1 fan has decided to host

410
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,450
to support you.

411
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,170
Why are you still sighing?

412
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,030
Because Lu Yue is also there.

413
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,870
Our team hasn't decided on the starting lineup yet.

414
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,990
It must be you!

415
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,100
You're so awesome.

416
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,550
Not necessarily.

417
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,420
Cheng said it needs to be fair.

418
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm thinking

419
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,270
about how

420
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,100
I can tip the balance to my favor.

421
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,430
Don't worry.

422
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,180
Girls should be confident.

423
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,630
Let's go pick out your battle clothes.

424
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,560
Battle clothes?

425
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,930
What battle clothes?

426
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,110
Our team's just chosen our uniforms.

427
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,740
It's different.

428
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,800
These are different battle clothes.

429
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:19,940
This...

430
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,620
This is the battle...

431
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,090
Go try it on.

432
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,010
A perfect woman

433
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,980
should always be ready to show her sexy side

434
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,040
to handle any unexpected situation.

435
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,740
I'm going to take promo photos,

436
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,030
not wedding photos.

437
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,020
Well said.

438
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,310
Tomorrow will be your first photo together with Cheng.

439
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:38,980
For your next

440
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,590
photo together, I hope it'll be on

441
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,030
your marriage certificate.

442
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,430
You're overthinking it.

443
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm sending you my best wishes.

444
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,240
My silly bestie snagging the esports heartthrob.

445
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,750
If that day really comes,

446
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,750
I could brag about it for a lifetime.

447
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,030
How did I end up with a friend like you?

448
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,750
This black one will show through my clothes.

449
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,420
How'd I go on stage to compete?

450
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,350
It's the allure of mystery, get it?

451
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,570
Then go try this one.

452
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,160
Hurry.

453
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,980
Go on.

454
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,860
This one's so cute.

455
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,100
Even underage girls

456
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,710
don't dress this childishly.

457
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,810
But I like it.

458
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,200
Fine.

459
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,220
Go try on these two pieces then.

460
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,450
Do I really need to?

461
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,510
Alright.

462
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,350
Since they haven't decided who's starting yet,

463
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,210
there's no use worrying about it.

464
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,580
Anyway, you need to take photos tomorrow.

465
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,100
Be in your best condition

466
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,460
to show your captain

467
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,580
that you're his best partner.

468
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,500
Once your couple photos with Cheng come out,

469
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,990
if fans' voices grow louder,

470
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,990
the club might make you the starter.

471
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,140
Alright, go on.

472
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,460
Please, please.

473
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,150
Go, go, go!

474
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,620
We're at a spa.

475
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,340
Why are you like a fish on a chopping board,

476
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,980
sighing and groaning?

477
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
Jinyang.

478
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,860
Since Lu Yue is back,

479
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,770
am I going to

480
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,150
lose my chance to be a starter in the new season?

481
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,080
You've said this

482
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,190
a million times today.

483
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,080
Don't fixate on it.

484
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,380
What's meant to be, will be.

485
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,780
If it's not, there's no use fighting for it.

486
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,570
Is it okay?

487
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,950
We're done.

488
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,260
Jinyang.

489
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,350
Since Lu Yue is back,

490
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,520
does that mean I won't be in the starting lineup?

491
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,880
Say something.

492
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,350
Jinyang.

493
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,140
Do you think I'm going to...

494
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,140
You won't be in the starting lineup?

495
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,020
Bye.

496
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,100
Go ahead.

497
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,490
Good luck, Tong Yao.

498
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,910
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

499
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,580
Look at how they're fighting this team battle.

500
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,860
Why are they hesitating?

501
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,180
We must gank them!

502
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,610
Look at their situation!

503
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,080
Honey! Honey!

504
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,020
Honey!

505
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,990
Honey.

506
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,170
Honey.

507
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,180
Why don't you come and check on me?

508
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,190
Put on makeup?

509
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,850
Even styled your hair?

510
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,970
Too bad there's no camera by the water cooler.

511
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,270
Lu Yue, don't go overboard.

512
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,800
Why are you sitting in my seat

513
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,400
and eating my snacks?

514
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,410
Give them to me.

515
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,270
It's fattening.

516
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,740
I'm helping you share the burden.

517
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,860
This is healthy.

518
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,800
What do you know?

519
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,130
It doesn't make you fat.

520
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,350
Tong Yao.

521
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,340
Come with me.

522
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,970
What's wrong, Cheng?

523
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,770
Do you want some dried mango?

524
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,700
It's very sweet.

525
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,770
What is this?

526
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,690
How can you use the keyboard with all that stuff on your nails?

527
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,650
And don't those long eyelashes

528
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,100
obstruct your vision?

529
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,430
Such a strong perfume scent.

530
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,060
Are you trying to choke your teammates

531
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,250
and lose the game?

532
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,930
If you want to be a starter,

533
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,660
just focus on practicing hard.

534
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Don't waste time on useless things.

535
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,790
Caught you in the act of favoritism, huh?

536
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,420
Delete it.

537
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,110
I won't!

538
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,030
If you dare tell Mom again,

539
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,150
I'll kill you.

540
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,050
Bro, you've changed!

541
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,220
Yao.

542
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,550
I forgot to gossip with you.

543
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,860
Guess who I ran into two days ago?

544
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,920
Did you see a ghost?

545
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,910
What ghost?

546
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,950
I ran into our third roommate.

547
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,330
She's actually dating our class monitor now.

548
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,530
That thick-skinned and heartless girl

549
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,400
was blushing and shy in front of our class monitor.

550
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,220
It was like her heart

551
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,430
was about to jump out of her throat.

552
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,340
Her heart was about to jump out of her throat?

553
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,140
How's that different from seeing a ghost?

554
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Don't interrupt.

555
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,770
Tong Yao.

556
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,830
What is it?

557
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,380
Where are the manicure and eyelashes I got for you?

558
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,580
Did Pancake eat them?

559
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,750
Cheng didn't approve.

560
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,190
Hey.

561
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,810
I've realized

562
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,830
only Cheng can keep you in check now.

563
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,520
How did the topic shift to Cheng again?

564
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,300
Remember the bar incident?

565
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,750
You were so frustrated.

566
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,610
But after Cheng took you home,

567
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,610
you were back to normal the next day.

568
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:50,930
Tell me,

569
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,490
did Cheng do something to you?

570
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,510
Be honest.

571
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,350
Now, when you think of Cheng,

572
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,940
do you feel over the moon, your heart racing,

573
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,270
your face turning red, and out of control?

574
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,630
I'll give you three seconds.

575
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,560
Answer quickly.

576
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,880
If you don't answer, I'll take it as a yes.

577
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,880
Do you like Cheng?

578
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,630
I...

579
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,800
Do you?

580
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,940
Come on, tell me.

581
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,160
Hey.

582
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,630
You're in love.

583
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Pancake!

584
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,620
Why didn't you knock?

585
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,720
Why didn't you lock the door?

586
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
I forgot.

587
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,860
I was too lazy to knock.

588
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,410
I thought you'd rolled off the bed.

589
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,220
Oh my god, it's Cheng!

590
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,880
You two are really together?

591
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,990
Everyone went to bed quite early today.

592
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,780
We have a promo shoot soon,

593
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,580
so I told everyone to rest early.

594
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,310
You're such a team captain.

595
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,810
Cheng.

596
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,750
Why did you come out from there?

597
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,110
She just rolled off the bed.

598
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,020
I went to help her up.

599
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,550
I also saw something funny.

600
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,990
Heard that?

601
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,190
She rolled off again.

602
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,030
Aren't you going back in to help her?

603
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,470
Forget it.

604
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,760
People need to learn to grow on their own.

605
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,740
You mocked me again.

606
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,510
I heard that.

607
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,210
I won't help you win tomorrow.

608
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,900
Remember to take your medicine before bed

609
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,120
for your insanity.

610
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,100
Did the sun rise from the west?

611
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,370
That night owl

612
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,430
actually got up early to read?

613
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,370
Here.

614
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,610
[Strange Pilgrims: Twelve Stories]

615
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,840
The title sounds so profound.

616
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,530
I don't get it.

617
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,700
Hey.

618
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,520
You're in love.

619
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,940
Go away!

620
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,360
Cheng, you're up so early.

621
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,900
Team CK had mid-season tournament match.

622
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,960
So I got up to watch.

623
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,070
Did they win?

624
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,220
They crushed Red Arrow and Obsidian.

625
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,350
As usual, they were thrashed by Alpha.

626
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,140
Do you feel over the moon, your heart racing,

627
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,140
-your face turning red...
-Shut up!

628
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,420
What?

629
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,020
Nothing, nothing.

630
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,960
What are you doing?

631
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,610
There's fur stuck on your head.

632
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,500
It's Pancake's fur.

633
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,380
I'm working on my core today.

634
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,710
Yao, want to work out?

635
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,630
Let's go, let's go.

636
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,190
-Let's go.
-Let's work out.

637
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,550
Healthy nuts.

638
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,690
Healthy living.

639
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,449
Not bad.

640
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,790
Muscles.

641
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,489
You're not even starting in the National League.

642
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,449
Why are you training so hard?

643
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,060
You're not starting either.

644
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,130
Why are you so serious?

645
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,929
It's already a done deal.

646
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,230
Don't make your delusions sound so real.

647
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,110
You can't afford to scare me to death.

648
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm definitely starting.

649
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,600
You're definitely not starting.

650
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,980
You're definitely not starting.

651
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,050
Why are you copying me?

652
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,230
Why are you copying me?

653
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,440
I'm not copying you.

654
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,940
I'm not copying you.

655
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,880
Childish.

656
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,070
Childish.

657
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,010
Cat.

658
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,320
What's up?

659
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,210
Have you ever seen a living moron?

660
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,500
Moron?

661
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,200
Where?

662
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,050
Over there.

663
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,280
What's wrong with them?

664
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,290
And you too.

665
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,990
What's that smell?

666
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,300
Moron...

667
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,730
You're so dramatic...

668
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,990
The new team uniforms are here!

669
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,670
The uniforms are here. Take a look.

670
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,930
How are they?

671
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,750
This one looks the best.

672
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,230
Didn't you insist

673
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,790
that black would make you look slimmer and better?

674
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,580
It's just right.

675
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,980
It's called making the best of what you have.

676
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,040
Do you understand?

677
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,980
Didn't you say you were afraid of looking fat?

678
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,910
I fell for your nonsense.

679
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,410
It's not even half the size of my uniform.

680
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,890
Never trust a girl when they say

681
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,640
they're fat.

682
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,080
It's not about whether she's fat or not.

683
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,550
She just looks like a kid no matter what she wears.

684
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,820
What are you saying?

685
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,910
Where are your manners?

686
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,100
Who looks like a kid?
