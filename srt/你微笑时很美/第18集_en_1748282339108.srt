1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,840
Go back to received

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,880
your okbyost.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:03,960
Time to go.

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,960
pledged.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,120
A guest.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,160
files are

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,880
selected by ChenWei

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,880
I am also a public figure.

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Hello?

10
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Yao Yao, you fought with someone? Are you okay?

11
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Come, let me say something.

12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,880
Yao Yao, you have to protect yourself when you go out.

13
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Don't make any trouble with others.

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Dad, mom, I am fine.

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,880
I know, I know. Don't worry about me.

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
I will notice it next time.

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,880
I still have something to do.

18
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,880
I will go to the hospital.

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,880
I have something to do. I will hang up first.

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,880
How is it? Do you feel better?

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,880
I will go to Guan Bo Niang now to apologize.

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,880
Then I will go back to avoid death.

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
When you come out to fight in society,

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,880
not everything can be solved with a single-sided effort.

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Actually, the punishment given by the club is okay.

26
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
This is good.

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
This is a competition.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
The punishment is very small.

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
It's like a competition.

30
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
The punishment is very painful.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
It's just a game.

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Now the whole thing is in the wind.

33
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
If someone really goes up to the top of the top of the top,

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,880
and goes to the top of the top of the top,

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,880
do you think it's still a game that can be solved?

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Brother Cheng.

37
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,880
It's time to relax a little.

38
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Suprise Team of Challenge

39
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
who is not New Astonished of Yang's Little Freaming?

40
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Just holding back, I have a question.

41
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
You're so punished.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Why didn't you give him a little more?

43
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,360
Don't be so angry.

44
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,680
You can't do this.

45
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,520
How did you take the rhythm?

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,960
I saw it.

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
So I said I didn't take more.

48
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,360
He's a loser.

49
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Women can't be women.

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,880
These people are going to heaven.

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,880
What kind of quality do you have with these people?

52
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,360
I really can't stand these women.

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,280
I always mention some unreasonable requirements.

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,560
Do you think you can be a hypocrite

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,880
if you spend money?

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
Actually.

57
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,400
What?

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,160
You think your girlfriend is not fierce enough?

59
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,080
No.

60
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Mu Lan.

61
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,680
You're so weak.

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,200
You seem to be

63
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,680
being beaten up by the police.

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
What's wrong with you?

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
Our captain can't be angry.

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Why should he be angry?

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,320
He's trying to be a good man.

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,680
He wants to be a good person.

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,040
Don't take the rhythm.

70
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,120
It's been a long time.

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm being beaten up.

72
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,320
That's a big deal.

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,440
If I were your captain,

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,960
I would be angry.

75
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,200
But why don't you explain?

76
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,920
You're asking about being beaten up by your mom?

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm not explaining.

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm explaining everything

79
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,760
like I'm being beaten up.

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
It's useless.

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,520
And Mrs. Lu.

82
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,080
Mrs. Lu.

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,320
Lu Si Cheng's mom.

84
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,800
I can't say anything.

85
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,920
I dare to say it.

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,800
Look.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,600
You're going to the wall so soon?

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,560
Tong Yao.

89
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
You're a professional businessman.

90
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,680
You're bullying me.

91
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,600
Shut up.

92
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,320
You're not a public official.

93
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,480
Why should you hang up?

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,360
How can I say it?

95
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,800
You should apologize.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
Isn't hanging the wall basic operation?

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
Look.

98
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,680
There's a video here.

99
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,280
It's called the truth.

100
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,080
What's going on?

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,720
Don't tell me

102
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,680
we're all because

103
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
we're afraid of the princess's interaction.

104
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,280
We're so busy

105
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,960
that we don't know who's going to be punished.

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,200
That's why we're being punished.

107
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,920
What's going on?

108
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,520
You're just...

109
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
You're just a public official.

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,120
Who sent the video?

111
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
What video?

112
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,400
I don't know.

113
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,360
I didn't come that day.

114
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm just a public official.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,880
How can I be so careful?

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
Who's the worker?

117
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,160
The rhythm master.

118
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,080
He's a master of the game.

119
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,400
He's the one who's the leader

120
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,360
of the public.

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
He's amazing.

122
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,920
Welcome to my world.

123
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,000
No matter who sent it,

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
you're my benefactor.

125
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
And I'm going to

126
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,480
trouble you all that day.

127
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Don't say that.

129
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,440
Don't.

130
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,480
I'm going to be punished.

131
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,240
Who sent it?

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,160
Who?

133
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,360
Stand up.

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,120
Maybe it's the middle-aged lady.

135
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,560
She's going to be punished.

136
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I knew it.

137
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,080
She's so talented,

138
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,800
and she's the one who's the leader of the game.

139
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
She's the one who's the best.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,240
She must be...

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,400
You're a good worker.

142
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,720
Training.

143
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
There's a game tomorrow.

144
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
You're still angry?

145
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,480
Who?

146
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,880
Everyone.

147
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,640
Take care of yourself.

148
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
I don't want to play the training game.

149
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,920
You guys get ready.

150
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,560
I'll wake up today.

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,760
The game with He Yao tomorrow

152
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,280
is for Lu Ye.

153
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,080
The training game will be for Lu Ye,

154
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,280
so let him play it.

155
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,920
Come on.

156
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,240
Give me the big dog.

157
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,280
I want the big dog.

158
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,840
Besides the big dog and the big flower,

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,720
can't you buy something else?

160
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
What kind of machine?

161
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,520
Lighting lights?

162
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,240
You can use it for both.

163
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,200
He...

164
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,240
He's the one who's the best.

165
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,880
Can the middle-aged and retired

166
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,400
and the old-aged people in the background

167
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
not talk?

168
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,840
Tong Yao,

169
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,880
why do you say

170
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,800
no one has trained him

171
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
when you're playing the game?

172
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,840
No one can use it.

173
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,240
You can use it.

174
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,920
Sometimes,

175
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,440
the set is more important than the version.

176
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,360
Thank you.

177
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,040
Look.

178
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,880
The other team

179
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,200
chose Yan Yan Luo.

180
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Think about it.

181
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,760
When you played Yan Yan Luo,

182
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,920
what did the other team

183
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,880
hit you the most?

184
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,160
Brother Cheng,

185
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:14,680
get him a

186
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,200
drop yourself.

187
00:08:44,680 --> 00:09:02,420
Admit Ani to the heights

188
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
It's not good

189
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,080
Look, nobody's here

190
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,080
He has a duty to protect you all.

191
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,280
Protecting this team from trouble.

192
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,080
Last year, when this kid was in trouble,

193
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,480
he also broke the team.

194
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,280
It's not easy to suppress this.

195
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,880
If he gets into the competition for now,

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,680
if this thing gets worse,

197
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,080
there's no way he'll win.

198
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
So, there are some things

199
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
that he can't help you and teach you.

200
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,880
Don't be too disappointed.

201
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,280
Understand?

202
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
Tong Yang, you have to know that

203
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,480
you understand what you really mean.

204
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
You guys are a bunch of careless kids.

205
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,280
You always make the captain worry.

206
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,080
Okay, don't think too much.

207
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,880
It'll all be over.

208
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
Hold on.

209
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,280
Don't let him go, bro.

210
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Can't you just keep it?

211
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,480
Our mid-level team is really going to be

212
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,280
a bunch of idiots and die in a flash.

213
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Shut up. I'm about to lose my weight.

214
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm about to starve to death.

215
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,680
Can I finish it?

216
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,080
Come here and push.

217
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,280
Wait for someone to come and catch you.

218
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,080
Coming.

219
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Open the team.

220
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Come on.

221
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,880
There's a big one.

222
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,080
Go.

223
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
Come on.

224
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,280
Lu Yu, where are you?

225
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,880
Go.

226
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,280
There's another one.

227
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,080
There's another one.

228
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,880
Go.

229
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Yes.

230
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Nice.

231
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Yes.

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
How was it, Tong Yang?

233
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,880
Did it work?

234
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
You've lost the top level of Shaoyun in the previous season.

235
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
You can make it.

236
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
You're just looking at yourself

237
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
and your dog's growth.

238
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,480
What?

239
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,880
The first time was a report.

240
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,280
The second time was a relief.

241
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,880
The third time was a small group.

242
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,480
The fourth time was a problem.

243
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
The fifth time was a problem.

244
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,280
Can you clear it for me?

245
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Next time, we'll meet the next team.

246
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
We won't win.

247
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Can you say something nice?

248
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,480
Nice?

249
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Sure.

250
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,880
We'll spend time together.

251
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
We'll practice together.

252
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
We'll watch the game.

253
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
We'll read the Weibo.

254
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
We'll read the comics.

255
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
We'll have a good time.

256
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Do you hear me?

257
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,480
You can do it.

258
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
What about the horse?

259
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
It's a good chance.

260
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,680
The horse can't do it.

261
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
But it's a nationality.

262
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Can you be more professional?

263
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,480
When I was on a break,

264
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
I watched the game.

265
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Sometimes, I played with Wu Ziqi.

266
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,680
You're not a qualified middle-aged man.

267
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,280
Can we stop talking?

268
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
I'm starving.

269
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,080
Me too.

270
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,680
Let's go.

271
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Go to eat.

272
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,280
Okay.

273
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,880
Let's go.

274
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,080
Let's go.

275
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Let's eat.

276
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,680
Let's go.

277
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Let's go.

278
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
Xiao Xiqi.

279
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,880
What are you doing?

280
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
I'm not going.

281
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
You go.

282
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm not hungry.

283
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,680
I'll be on the live broadcast later.

284
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,280
The salary is almost deducted.

285
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm not in a mood to pay.

286
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,280
It's a few hundred thousand yuan.

287
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,480
With that money,

288
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,280
I'll buy some bags.

289
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,080
I'll buy some dresses.

290
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,480
I'll be happy.

291
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
How good is that?

292
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,680
Okay.

293
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Then you can start the live broadcast.

294
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,280
I'll bring you something delicious.

295
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Be honest with your live broadcast.

296
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,480
Don't talk nonsense.

297
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,280
Okay.

298
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Bye.

00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,360
hello.

303
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,600
I just ordered a limits어

304
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,320
It's done.

305
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,880
Thank you.

306
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
Did you eat upцы?

307
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,880
Why youenne Drug Good Other

308
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,120
people speak ofrane

309
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm really good at practicing.

310
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
No.

311
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,800
If it was in the past,

312
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,320
how could it be so quiet?

313
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,840
Sir, your porridge is ready.

314
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,440
Thank you.

315
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm going back first.

316
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,960
Let's go back together after eating.

317
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,920
I'll get you some fresh porridge.

318
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,720
You guys eat.

319
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,240
Meng.

320
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,480
Look at Brother Cheng's operation.

321
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,360
Did you see me?

322
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Why did you look at me like that?

323
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,440
Didn't Brother Cheng eat the steamed bun?

324
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,320
Look at him.

325
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,280
Why did you hit me?

326
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,600
Why did you hit me?

327
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
You hit my upper half.

328
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,160
How could you mix it up?

329
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,680
I wonder what your female fans예 your ice cream?

330
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,520
BLEEPOX

331
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,560
Smiling beat people.

332
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,720
He beat people.

333
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,280
What's wrong with the teammates?

334
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,480
These players are so young and old.

335
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,560
How can they be so bad

336
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,680
if they're in a interaction game?

337
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,560
How can they be so...

338
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,760
This man is a man.

339
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,040
Wait a minute.

340
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,720
Don't be mad.

341
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,680
Let him talk.

342
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,520
Players are so young and old.

343
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,560
They're so young and old.

344
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,360
Are they eating you or drawing you?

345
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,360
They're not selling their jobs.

346
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,240
They're not feeling well.

347
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,360
They can't stop.

348
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,360
What do you mean?

349
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,080
A group of young people

350
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,240
are playing games

351
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,400
and making so much money.

352
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,720
They're making so much money.

353
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,600
They're making so much money.

354
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,680
You should come too.

355
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,600
Come on.

356
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,840
You can't stop.

357
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,200
Now the club is so busy.

358
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,960
They're all calling you.

359
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Who's stopping you?

360
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,120
It's just an activity.

361
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,720
Others can't do it.

362
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,040
You're so heartless.

363
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,520
The teacher told you to run to the playground

364
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
and give you a thousand five hundred.

365
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,440
Are you going?

366
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,200
Others can run.

367
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,160
But you can't.

368
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,280
I think Xiaopeng and the others

369
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,400
did it in the end.

370
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
It's also a smile

371
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,560
on the face of the show.

372
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,160
No, it's not.

373
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,200
Can you cry?

374
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,160
You really don't want to do it?

375
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
What do you ZZDX workers do?

376
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,840
Let a team member go to the exam.

377
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,640
They're being charged

378
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,880
for being shot.

379
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,840
Are you happy

380
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,640
that you've made a deal today?

381
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
I'm happy.

382
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,800
I'm happy.

383
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,400
To be honest,

384
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,680
I don't regret at all.

385
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,560
I can't continue to play this game.

386
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,320
It's inappropriate.

387
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,040
What's wrong?

388
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,280
We only knew

389
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,440
about this

390
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,520
after we arrived at the scene.

391
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,760
We even informed him.

392
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,480
Brother Rui can't talk.

393
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,560
It's not his fault.

394
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,000
To be honest,

395
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,680
I regret only

396
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,360
that this happened

397
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,000
because my teammates were so aggressive.

398
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,480
The club also was so aggressive.

399
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,840
It caused everyone to be in love with me.

400
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,440
Right.

401
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,240
I shouldn't have gone there.

402
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,080
There were so many people at the scene.

403
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,280
I should have...

404
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,480
So fast.

405
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,760
You're a traitor.

406
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,560
You're a traitor.

407
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,720
You should have beaten him.

408
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Really.

409
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,240
I should have

410
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,360
talked to the host

411
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,880
about this.

412
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,280
Right.

413
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Because there were

414
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,440
a few players who just finished the treatment.

415
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,200
They really can't be so aggressive.

416
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,640
To communicate with everyone

417
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,360
and discuss about the solution.

418
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,000
It's definitely possible.

419
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,720
Right.

420
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,280
Everyone is a civilized person.

421
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,880
Fang Guan,

422
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,760
send a little flower to this passerby.

423
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,560
I think he's right.

424
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,280
I think so too.

425
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,320
I'm too impulsive.

426
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes.

427
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,120
Like a rich man.

428
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Really rich.

429
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
It's really inappropriate.

430
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,440
I shouldn't have owed him.

431
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,640
No little flower.

432
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,640
Forget it.

433
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Thank you, Brother Cheng.

434
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,720
Master, your eyes are almost drooping.

435
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
It's on my body.

436
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,400
It's so annoying.

437
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,000
You're talking about the rice cake?

438
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,480
Don't say that.

439
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,080
Lu Si Cheng,

440
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,360
the captain,

441
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
has been talking to me all day.

442
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,040
It seems that he fell into the cold hell.

443
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,360
He hasn't found a way to solve it yet.

444
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,520
He's still in the hell.

445
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,800
Hone him?

446
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,560
You think he's a three-year-old kid?

447
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,040
He's got a head ache.

448
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,880
Hone him?

449
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,560
Yes.

450
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,400
He's a good actor.

451
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,520
He's smart and well-behaved.

452
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,440
This guy said he'd go to Brother Cheng's room to report me.

453
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,320
What about Fang Guan?

454
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,280
He's working.

455
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,640
This guy is crazy.

456
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,880
He should be the one who

457
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,440
makes a fuss about his relationship with his teammates.

458
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,120
Don't say that, silly.

459
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,040
Five minutes ago,

460
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,320
Xigong promoted Lu Si Cheng's number

461
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
into your live broadcast room.

462
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,680
Can't you stop your kid?

463
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,880
You're so annoying.

464
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,920
I was just kidding.

465
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm going to the interview room now.

466
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,480
At the meeting next Monday,

467
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,640
I'll bring you

468
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,960
the most honest and honest talk

469
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,160
about the 10,000-word examination book.

470
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,800
Okay.

471
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,360
I'm going to write the examination.

472
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,160
I'll write it.

473
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,840
Okay.

474
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,560
Okay.

475
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm going to the interview room.

476
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,640
I'll turn off the broadcast.

477
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,360
Goodbye.

478
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,720
You're so annoying.

479
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
I'm so annoying.

480
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
Will I be the only one

481
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,680
who's been cursed by Lu Yue?

482
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,360
And then I'll be in the shadows

483
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,600
and fight with him all my life.

484
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,640
Then I'll turn into a little transparent person.

485
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,880
Only when I'm on the phone

486
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,040
will I remember me.

487
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,800
Who's so good at calling me on the phone?

488
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Your teammates

489
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
are so mean.

490
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,480
They're talking about air.

491
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,440
How can you be so cold-hearted

492
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,560
to watch your own game?

493
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,840
I think you're hungry.

494
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,720
Didn't the captain bring you porridge?

495
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,280
Go to bed after you eat.

496
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,160
You're so excited.

497
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,280
You're going to be there.

498
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,520
Your hand is still your hand.

499
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,680
The captain can't talk to you

500
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,000
for the rest of his life.

501
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Really?

502
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,800
Didn't you guys

503
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,600
already send the pass to the club?

504
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,640
Can you still use it?

505
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,240
I'm not asking about that.

506
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,240
Don't you think

507
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,360
if you really want to

508
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,800
stay with someone for the rest of your life,

509
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,760
who would be worried

510
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,520
if he's hungry or not

511
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,720
and bring him porridge?

512
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,680
You just want to make him

513
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,360
feel guilty

514
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,880
and make him eat the dog's bag, okay?

515
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
What I care about

516
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,240
is whether the captain is polite to you

517
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,960
and now he's trying to hide it.

518
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,240
The young people you love

519
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,240
are all like you.

520
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
They're so magical.

521
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,960
Miss.

522
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,960
Miss.

523
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,440
I didn't expect you to be so cruel

524
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,520
to the captain.

525
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,080
What?

526
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,360
You were kicked out

527
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,640
by the captain and fell off the street?

528
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,240
We've just

529
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,040
turned your car back to the scene.

530
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,520
Can you give it to you?

531
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,800
No, okay?

532
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,240
Where did you guys go

533
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,120
after you left?

534
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,320
Why did you come back so late?

535
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,120
We didn't go anywhere.

536
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,520
We just came back after we had dinner.

537
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,160
Yeah.

538
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
What about Brother Cheng?

539
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Brother Cheng said

540
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,040
he was afraid that he'd get cold and starved.

541
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,400
But now it looks like

542
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,840
he's afraid that you'll starve to death.

543
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,000
What did you say?

544
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,960
Say it again.

545
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,160
You two

546
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
haven't said anything yet.

547
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,840
No.

548
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,960
You two

549
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,120
are too arrogant

550
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,320
and too arrogant.

551
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,600
You're going to die forever.

552
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,280
Good for you.

553
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Nangou.

554
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,200
Nangou.

555
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,800
Nangou.

556
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,160
Wmak,

557
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,320
leading firm of partner's team

558
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,120
.

559
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
Hello, audience LAFkoes

560
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
of not- coffee shop

561
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
The first player in the team,

562
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
the most important thing is that

563
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,880
today's first game of the LCKX

564
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,200
is the first game of the LCKX.

565
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,920
I haven't seen Lü Yu's shadow

566
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,080
in the competition for a long time.

567
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,560
But...

568
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,320
Don't worry.

569
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,680
The team has already made a good call.

570
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,200
They won't discuss your game issue.

571
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Thank you, Lü.

572
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,680
I always think Lü Yu is a very powerful player.

573
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,920
But the opponent's mid is not a fast player.

574
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,600
Although he says he wants to be very active,

575
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,280
but this player is in the professional league.

576
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,400
He can climb the top 5.

577
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,480
I've met him when I was playing the RUN.

578
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,200
He can use anything.

579
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm so bored to meet such a player.

580
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,880
They can't not know

581
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,360
that I was not in the competition today.

582
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,560
Every team member in the LCKX

583
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,520
has fans.

584
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,200
Most of them are dead fans.

585
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
They appeared here

586
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,720
to prove that they haven't given up.

587
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,960
I let them down.

588
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Where?

589
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,920
Mr. Wang.

590
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,880
Yes.

591
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,040
The competition is going to start.

592
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,240
Lü Yu, are you nervous?

593
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm not.

594
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,640
You are?

595
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,600
Good job, Lü Yu.

596
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,760
No problem.

597
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,600
Good job.

598
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,280
Let's see if we can win this round.

599
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,880
Good job.

600
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Good job.

601
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,880
Test, test, test.

602
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,600
OK, OK.

603
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Let's hear it.

604
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,840
Listen carefully.

605
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,680
OK.

606
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,840
Yan Hua.

607
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
He has a big ear.

608
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh,

609
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
the Black Demon Team

610
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,120
has moved the

611
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Bidding Dragon and the Big Ear.

612
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,760
They are all

613
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,560
very good players.

614
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,760
It seems that

615
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,360
the Black Demon Team

616
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,560
has made a

617
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,960
serious mistake

618
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,760
after getting the news

619
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
that Smiley was going to enter the competition.

620
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,440
Yes.

621
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,000
Look at the LCKX.

622
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,240
They moved the light and the rain.

623
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,600
It seems that the firemen

624
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,440
in the middle of the day are true.

625
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,960
To be honest, I am very excited.

626
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,480
Yes.

627
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,160
This match

628
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,280
is very important for the LCKX.

629
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,520
If they can win,

630
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,040
they will use the whole victory

631
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,760
to vote for the LCKX.

632
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,600
To be honest,

633
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,200
I was very confident

634
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,320
about their victory.

635
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,840
But

636
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,520
they did such a thing yesterday.

637
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,040
So it's so embarrassing.

638
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,680
That's right.

639
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,760
When they were in the previous week,

640
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,240
the ZGDS was almost perfect.

641
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,840
Here,

642
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,720
even people who

643
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,520
don't praise the players

644
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,640
very rarely like Chessmen,

645
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,360
they are very confident

646
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,640
in this match.

647
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,400
In this way,

648
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,280
it looks like a flag.

649
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,880
Don't say that.

650
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,080
We know that

651
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,360
the LCKX players

652
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,560
are very confident.

653
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,480
But at the same time,

654
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
their spirit pool

655
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,880
has always been a problem.

656
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,200
Because they are too strong.

657
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
Yes.

658
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,720
Today,

659
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,840
the fireworks and the big-headed dogs

660
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,680
were all moved.

661
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,560
I am very curious

662
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,520
what kind of spirit pool

663
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,480
they will use today

664
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,920
to win this match.

665
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,520
Lu Yu,

666
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
you can take Yan Yan Lu.

667
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,960
No problem.

668
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,480
Xiaofang,

669
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,720
you can take Yan Yan Lu.

670
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,320
Yes.

671
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
I will take Yan Yan Lu.

672
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,080
I will take Yan Yan Lu.

673
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,920
I will take Yan Yan Lu.

674
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
I will take Yan Yan Lu.

675
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,360
Is it a good one?

676
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,080
Yes.

677
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,120
Or a good one?

678
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,320
Yan Yan Lu.

679
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,520
Lu Yu, you can take Yan Yan Lu.

680
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
Yan Yan Lu is a very strong spirit

681
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,680
on this version.

682
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,720
Especially because he has

683
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,760
a super-wide

684
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,960
skill-reliant range.

685
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,320
He can be a good player on the scene.

686
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,880
And in the later team battle,

687
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,080
it's also very difficult.

688
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,680
You said that

689
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,880
I think Yan Yan Lu

690
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,440
is really a very suitable

691
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,520
player for this spirit pool.

692
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,320
I don't know what kind of performance

693
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,720
they will bring us.

694
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,120
Okay.

695
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
Now both teams have played

696
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,280
the choice of the spirit pool.

697
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,360
Let's take a look at the final

698
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,240
certain spirit pool.

699
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
The top three

700
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,320
for the top three

701
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,920
are the one who got the duck.

702
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,680
The one who got the old K

703
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,160
is the one who got the leaf.

704
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,880
The one who got the green

705
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,600
is Yan Yan Lu.

706
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,440
The one who got the blue

707
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,120
is Bai Lang.

708
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,200
The one who got the support is Yi Mulian.

709
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,320
Let's take a look at the blackout.

710
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,360
The red fire on the way

711
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,480
is already on the sky.

712
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,520
The mid-air is about to fall.

713
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,120
The round is about to start.

714
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,920
I will play later.

715
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,520
I will play later.

716
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,320
The team game continues.

717
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,120
The game begins.

718
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,720
Has the old K

719
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,040
and the blue team helped you?

720
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,320
Okay.

721
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,760
I am the one who brought the spirit pool.

722
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,080
I will listen to you.

723
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,560
Okay.

724
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,360
Lu Yue, don't be too harsh.

725
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,760
Okay.

726
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,160
The green team is really stable.

727
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,600
That's right.

728
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,520
The forward is not too bad.

729
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,000
Yan Yan Lu is in a critical situation.

730
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,840
The game is over.

731
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,240
He is ready to go back to the field.

732
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,600
The player is about to be shot.

733
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,920
Yan Luo is not going forward.

734
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
The player who is in a critical situation

735
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,720
is leading the game.

736
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,760
The player who is in a critical situation

737
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,920
is too good.

738
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,520
Yu Quan got the first goal.

739
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,280
Yan Luo,

740
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,800
Yan Luo,

741
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,320
Yan Luo,

742
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,760
this is not bad.

743
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,640
The player who is playing Yan Luo

744
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,560
is better than me.

745
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,360
Yan Yan.

746
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,520
A little bit.

747
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,320
I think it's a little bit more

748
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,280
better than you.

749
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,920
If I play better than him,

750
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I will go to play.

751
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,520
Right?

752
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,320
Nice.

753
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:36,840
Okay.

754
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Lu Yue, the team.

755
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,640
The blue team is in a critical situation.

756
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,600
Xiaopang, follow them.

757
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:43,960
Coming.

758
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,760
The green team is going to take him.

759
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,360
The team battle is going to take place next.

760
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,720
Nice.

761
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
DGDX got two people.

762
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,920
They won the game.

763
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,760
I will go to the ice.

764
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,080
I will go back to the ice.

765
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,480
DGDX, it's too hard.

766
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,120
Be careful.

767
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,680
Don't get caught.

768
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,200
Please go back.

769
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,160
Go back.

770
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,600
But the person is not in a critical situation.

771
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,680
Go back.

772
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,800
I will go to the ice.

773
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,240
Lu Yue.

774
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,640
Right now.

775
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,240
Lu Yue.

776
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,000
Hey.

777
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yu is still in the ice.

778
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,520
He is not going to the ice.

779
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,160
Wait.

780
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,800
He is coming.

781
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,880
How can he go to the team battle

782
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,560
and make a fool of himself?

783
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,600
Lu Yue, hurry up.

784
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,520
I am in a hurry.

785
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,680
I can't get out.

786
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,040
Hurry up.

787
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,240
Why?

788
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,920
The green team is going to the ice.

789
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,520
Go to the ice.

790
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:22,960
Go to the ice.

791
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,520
Go to the ice.

792
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,840
The wind is blowing in the direction of the wind.

793
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,000
Go back.

794
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,400
Lu Yue, your earphone is broken.

795
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,480
Do you hear what we are saying?

796
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,200
The economic advantage that we just established

797
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,560
is being chased by the black team in this game.

798
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,400
Yu's team

799
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,240
is not so weak.

800
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,920
Continue in the team.

801
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,920
Anna, can you keep the channel on?

802
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:55,160
Take time to

803
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,600
fix the cloud at its peak.

804
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,640
Cool, cool.

805
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,720
At the last pull.

806
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,400
Keep chasing.

807
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
Halt.

808
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,120
Lan retaining..."

809
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,160
Lanlively.

810
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,320
Well done.

811
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,460
Hurry, I can make it in one go.

812
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,420
Give him

813
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,140
I had no idea that Lu Yuan could win.

814
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,320
Eventually, this will change your entire police maniac

815
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,280
after I notice that you always act

816
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,020
asบQ and shaman lipslick when you're looking.

817
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,540
You know most of them!

818
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,140
You're the chief of the police.

819
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,920
You're the one who tried to capture everyone with your eyes

820
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,940
who ran into my seasoning and decided to spit out this abalone.

821
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,220
It can't be true as long as you have their reason.

822
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,840
Mr. Huainu even picked some business cards for me!

823
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,040
This doesn't make sense at all,

824
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,640
especially in the first place.

825
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,840
Should牛 get just what I get.

826
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,740
You let me sacrifice myself toglony ripped my body!

827
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,420
Are you listening?

828
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:14,420
I've said in the video after the third interview that I'm happy to have a teammate like Smiling.

829
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Because of his introduction, ZZDX will become the top of the top this summer.

830
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,420
But now they're questioning my eyes.

831
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,420
They're questioning whether I made a mistake or not.

832
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,420
I'm biased towards you and Lu Yue.

833
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,420
Why?

834
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Taitou.

835
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
I'm not.

836
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,420
Taitou.

837
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,420
But I don't care about others' attention and my judgment.

838
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
The key is you.

839
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,420
I care about you.

840
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,420
There's still seven minutes.

841
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
Before the next game starts,

842
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,420
I want to say no matter what others say,

843
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,420
I don't want to give up on your reason.

844
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,420
You're looking at me like that.

845
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
I can't stand it.

846
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,420
You're looking at me more.

847
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,420
I can't even memorize the number of the ID.

848
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,420
There's still 60 seconds left.

849
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,420
I... Can I ask you a question?

850
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,420
What's your identity and position?

851
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,420
Your captain and your teammate can pick up any number of the ID.

852
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,420
60 minutes.

853
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,420
I want to answer everyone's questions.

854
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
It's not a question you're talking about for the sake of the word.

855
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Please make a video about the city where you talked about the flower market.

856
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
60 minutes.

857
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,420
Don't count it.

858
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,420
Give me some time or a hint.

859
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,420
You suddenly asked me that I wasn't prepared at all.

860
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,420
I couldn't say anything.

861
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
From that day on, your behavior was different.

862
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,420
I'm a man.

863
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
The A.J.A. team is on the list.

864
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,420
Before the end of the career team,

865
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,420
they're making a mess.

866
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
When the A.J.A. team leaves,

867
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,420
the team is like a mother and a friend.

868
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
They say that when they see their actions,

869
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,420
they're called a fool.

870
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
From then on, everyone says that they've been in a hurry.

871
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,420
They've been in a hurry for two years.

872
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,420
Even if they're on live every day for 10 hours,

873
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,420
they can't find a single dirty word.

874
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,420
They won't be able to fool themselves.

875
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
What's the use of that?

876
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
It's not a joke.

877
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
When the C.A.L. team captain

878
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
was in the national team,

879
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
he was busy and had a lot of fun.

880
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
He was absent and had a lot of training.

881
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,420
He even ran out to play games with his sister.

882
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,420
In the end, the national team was defeated.

883
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,420
He was defeated like a mountain.

884
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
He was killed by the A.J.A. team.

885
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,420
He was laughed at.

886
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,420
He said that he was arrogant and self-righteous.

887
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Even if everyone knows that he's been like that for a year,

888
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,420
he's got a big temper.

889
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,420
He's a low-key, shy,

890
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
serious and calm.

891
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
What's the use of that?

892
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
He's not a bad actor.

893
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Do you remember what I told you?

894
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
I'm serious.

895
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
Any of the professional players

896
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,420
are easily released.

897
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
Even the professional voice is cut off.

898
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
So, don't take it away.

899
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Where did you go?

900
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
The back of my head.

901
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,420
In the training match yesterday,

902
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
Lu Yue was killed by the A.J.A. team.

903
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
After that,

904
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,420
he couldn't get up from all the other teams.

905
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
Out of them,

906
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
5 minutes 37 seconds,

907
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
7 minutes 49 seconds,

908
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
12 minutes 11 seconds,

909
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,420
and he was trying to get the center of gravity.

910
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,420
He was used to being in the tower

911
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
and causing the other team to lose.

912
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,420
The game today was just a matter of 12 minutes 20 seconds.

913
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
After the 10-game break,

914
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
we 4 were 5 people on the other side.

915
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
But the other team

916
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
was under pressure from me.

917
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
The equipment and the economy were all down.

918
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,420
So, we were able to get the center of gravity.

919
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Even if we were surrounded by the black belt,

920
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
we could have won the game.

921
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
At the critical moment,

922
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
Lu Yue went with me.

923
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
He went to the center of gravity and got a wave of ice.

924
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
But we lost one person.

925
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
3 rounds.

926
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Can you talk to us?

927
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Is your earphone broken?

928
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
Retreat.

929
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,420
This is a black belt.

930
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
If it's CK,

931
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
or YQCB,

932
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
we will lose.

933
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
Hurry up.

934
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,420
We can't cooperate.

935
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
Why can't we cooperate?

936
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,420
Because when you were in the training game,

937
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,420
you were used to being under pressure from the other team.

938
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
K also because you

939
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,420
practiced a habit of counter-attacking.

940
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Tong Yao,

941
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,420
step back a little bit.

942
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
I'll catch you guys.

943
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
K,

944
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
hurry up.

945
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
Coming.

946
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
He is a more advanced player.

947
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
He is easily impulsive.

948
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,420
But his accuracy of judgment is still high.

949
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
When he is over the river,

950
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
I will help him to get better.

951
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
It's because K changed his approach to you.

952
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,420
Lu Yue went to the field.

953
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
He didn't get used to it.

954
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
The team just now

955
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
was in the middle of the game.

956
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
He was very nervous.

957
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
He didn't get used to it.

958
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
If the other team

959
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
was in the middle of the game,

960
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
you would get hurt.

961
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
That's why

962
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,420
they were not hesitate to get hurt.

963
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Why?

964
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
The habit of cooperating.

965
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Where is the habit of cooperating?

966
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
Come on, follow me.

967
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
Come on, follow me.

968
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Nice.

969
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Usually,

970
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
we practice in the training game.

971
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
We are good at both.

972
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
If I can't change my approach to my teammates,

973
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
why can't you be so irresponsible?

974
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
Now you think

975
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
this is your own business?

976
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,420
You did things wrong

977
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,420
and got punished.

978
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,420
It's a lie.

979
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,420
You sat on the stage

980
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
and watched your teammates game.

981
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,420
You never thought

982
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,420
your teammates would get punished like you.

983
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
They had to

984
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
practice the game

985
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
with you

986
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
as an imposter.

987
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,420
They started to practice again.

988
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
First,

989
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
they don't know how to look back.

990
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Second, they don't care about the other team's mistakes.

991
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
They are fighting again.

992
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Will the team use you?

993
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,420
You should join the training competition.

994
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Shouldn't Ruan still invite you?

995
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Should you change the style again?

996
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
There are many good players in this game.

997
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,420
It's even more difficult for the top players.

998
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,420
Should we continue using you or Lu Yue?

999
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Or should we find a new target?

1000
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,420
Lu Yue was banned from the competition because of a mistake.

1001
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
He hurt the reputation.

1002
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,420
He hurt us not to participate in the national finals.

1003
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,420
He came back this time and chose to forgive us.

1004
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,420
You can ask him.

1005
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,420
Did he forgive himself now?

1006
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,420
How do you feel?

1007
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,420
The final match is a team game.

1008
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,420
The players are calm.

1009
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,420
There is no personal heroism.

1010
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,420
There are three minutes left.

1011
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,420
I said that I don't care what others think.

1012
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,420
I care about how you look at yourself.

1013
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,420
Whether you continue or give up,

1014
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,420
the professional competition is not a place to be popular.

1015
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,420
The professional players are very strict.

1016
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
The golden peak is more transferable.

1017
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,420
You can't waste your confidence and be more confident.

1018
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,420
I am the captain of the team.

1019
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,420
Miss, I don't care what you think.

1020
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,420
But I'm sure ZZDX will be a top professional team.

1021
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,420
I'm here to fight for you.

1022
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,420
There may be some people in this circle

1023
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,420
because you are different from girls.

1024
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
You have a good temper.

1025
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,420
You are a good match.

1026
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,420
I don't know how to fight.

1027
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,420
I'm a different person.

1028
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,420
You are right.

1029
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
Brother Cheng.

1030
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,420
Brother Cheng, open the door.

1031
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Time is up.

1032
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,420
It seems that you still have nothing to say to me.

1033
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,420
I won't say beautiful words.

1034
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,420
Nor will I say sorry to you.

1035
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,420
I just know that I want to win every match with you.

1036
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,420
I don't want to lack any match.

1037
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
I don't want to disappoint you.

1038
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
I don't want to be a class teacher of anyone.

1039
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,420
I want to be your teammate.

1040
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,420
Until one day,

1041
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,420
I can stand on the peak of the world that you and I want to stand on.

1042
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,420
I know you have suffered a lot.

1043
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
You are a teammate.

1044
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,420
Why did you look at me like that?

1045
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,420
We all appreciate your support.

1046
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
So we still play that game.

1047
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,420
Just to help you to lessen your rhythm.

1048
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,420
To get more evidence.

1049
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
And me.

1050
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,420
I also appreciate your support.

1051
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,420
But I'm not letting you ruin your own cold.

1052
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,420
Little girl.

1053
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,420
I just want you to know

1054
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,420
that when you protect others,

1055
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
you have to learn to protect yourself first.

1056
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,420
When can I protect myself?

1057
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,420
When you have a day when you can't beat others,

1058
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
something can change.

1059
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,420
gelernt these tastes.

1060
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
Captain.

1061
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,420
Brother Cheng,

1062
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,420
what are you doing?

1063
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
Let's have a court game.

1064
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
no one

1065
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,340
will go against

1066
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,000
you.

1067
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,780
Brother Cheng

1068
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,020
The last question

1069
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,940
what

1070
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,940
has been

1071
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,260
won't you give me up for

1072
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1073
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1074
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1075
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1076
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1077
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1078
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1079
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1080
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1081
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1082
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1083
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1084
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1085
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1086
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1087
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm not afraid of you.

1088
00:39:40,260 --> 00:40:05,920
Before, you have

1089
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,640
Using natural clothes to promote

1090
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,320
our fate

1091
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,360
because of you

1092
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,640
I was です

1093
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,420
So, in your eyes

1094
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,460
all of us follows the twinkling of front and back

1095
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,920
Since I was the one who controlled with it

1096
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,900
I wanted to be close and fall close to you

1097
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,940
Myentialopes find hidden front and back

1098
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,940
I want to be with you forever

1099
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,940
I want to be with you forever

1100
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,940
I want to be with you forever

1101
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,940
I want to be with you forever

1102
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
I want to be with you forever

1103
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,940
I want to be with you forever

1104
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,940
I want to be with you forever

1105
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,940
I want to be with you forever

1106
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,940
I want to be with you forever

1107
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,940
I want to be with you forever

1108
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,940
I want to be with you forever

1109
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,940
I want to be with you forever

1110
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,940
I want to be with you forever

1111
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,940
I want to be with you forever

1112
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,940
All your love

1113
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,940
Your nanos Von!!

1114
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,940
It was my殺
