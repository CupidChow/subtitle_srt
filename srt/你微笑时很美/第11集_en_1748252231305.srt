1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
The most dangerous person in the world

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:03,960
I saw you come with an un Tespeda

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,160
I feel the danger

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,400
You don't believe in Airlines

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,680
You have no position

6
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,520
Come, i can adjust

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,520
Adjust

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm awake, eyes are over

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,520
Keep adjusting

10
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,480
You don't love me

11
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,600
Be care you can go to the back

12
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,240
It's over there

13
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,320
Give me gas

14
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,360
Listen to me

15
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,320
You said to give me gas

16
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
I will die

17
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,200
Understand

18
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,160
How dare you kick me

19
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,640
I told you I will

20
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,520
I tell you how dare you point at me

21
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,080
Shoo after you

22
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,520
I'll show you my skill.

23
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,840
How about it?

24
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,800
Hit it.

25
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,040
You can do it.

26
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,640
You can do it.

27
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,200
You can do it.

28
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,000
You can do it.

29
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,440
Hit it.

30
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,840
Hit it.

31
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,800
Hit it.

32
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,840
Where are you going?

33
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,640
Hit it.

34
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
Hit it.

35
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,760
You're out of your mind.

36
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,280
It's really a snowboard.

37
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,440
It's so dirty.

38
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,440
I want to pull it.

39
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,640
I want to pull it.

40
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,800
I want to pull it.

41
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,840
I want to pull it.

42
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,720
I want to pull it.

43
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
I want to pull it.

44
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,560
I want to pull it.

45
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,440
I want to pull it.

46
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,360
I want to pull it.

47
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I want to pull it.

48
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,200
I want to pull it.

49
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
I want to pull it.

50
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,160
I want to pull it.

51
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,080
I want to pull it.

52
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to pull it.

53
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,800
I want to pull it.

54
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I want to pull it.

55
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
I want to pull it.

56
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
I want to pull it.

57
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I want to pull it.

58
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
I want to pull it.

59
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I want to pull it.

60
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I want to pull it.

61
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I want to pull it.

62
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I want to pull it.

63
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I want to pull it.

64
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I want to pull it.

65
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I want to pull it.

66
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
I want to pull it.

67
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
I want to pull it.

68
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
I want to pull it.

69
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
I want to pull it.

70
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
I want to pull it.

71
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I want to pull it.

72
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
I want to pull it.

73
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
I want to pull it.

74
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
I want to pull it.

75
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
I want to pull it.

76
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
I want to pull it.

77
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
I want to pull it.

78
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
I want to pull it.

79
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
I want to pull it.

80
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
I want to pull it.

81
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
I want to pull it.

82
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
I want to pull it.

83
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
I want to pull it.

84
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
I want to pull it.

85
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
I want to pull it.

86
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
I want to pull it.

87
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
I want to pull it.

88
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
I want to pull it.

89
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
I want to pull it.

90
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I want to pull it.

91
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
I want to pull it.

92
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
I want to pull it.

93
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
I want to pull it.

94
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,200
Everyottom

95
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I guess he's going to come to bite me later.

96
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,080
Old Kai, if you really don't come to help me,

97
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
I'll just tear it up for you.

98
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
It's really that kind of thing.

99
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
I'm a fighter.

100
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
I should have come back when I came.

101
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Miss, your electric and white diamond iron

102
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,080
is so cool that I can't predict.

103
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Where are you going?

104
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
You're Xu Xian.

105
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Just a life-saving injury.

106
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Give him a free treatment.

107
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
How pitiful you are.

108
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Let's fight for a while.

109
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
You go up and take a bite.

110
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
You'll be fine.

111
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Okay.

112
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Go up.

113
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
The black-and-white bullet of Xiao Pang

114
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
has two skills of two opponents.

115
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
It's just a half-blood.

116
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Keep it down.

117
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Xiao Pang is playing a magic spell.

118
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
The firefly is not controlled.

119
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
The front-line is connected.

120
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
The firefly is hit.

121
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
It's beautiful.

122
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Give me the control.

123
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Here it comes.

124
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Control.

125
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
The front-line is out.

126
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
It's a straight shot.

127
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
Oh my god.

128
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
The opponent who played this game

129
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
is not playing a magic spell.

130
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
The captain is a man.

131
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Feng Ling, it's a pity that your front-line is not.

132
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Okay.

133
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
The smell of the firefly is good.

134
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
But Xiao Hua looks a little anxious.

135
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Xiao Hua is too unworthy.

136
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
The sun is up.

137
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Catch or not catch?

138
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Okay.

139
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
The sun is up.

140
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
The sun is up.

141
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
K.

142
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Here it comes.

143
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
K.

144
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
K.

145
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Oh my god.

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
What's wrong with the sun?

147
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
You're good at smiling.

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Let's change the tactics.

149
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,080
I think we should change the tactics.

150
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Okay.

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Is the sun coming to the top?

152
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
I can't believe

153
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
the sun is coming to the top.

154
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
We see

155
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
that the mistake

156
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
might be a 10-game return.

157
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
This 10-game ZGDX battle

158
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
should be released.

159
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
We see that the sun is good.

160
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
After he put it down

161
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
and went down,

162
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
both the gank

163
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
and the head are taken.

164
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
The發育 is good.

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
But the most important thing

166
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
is the middle and the lower way.

167
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
The Chessmen

168
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
has already changed the tactics.

169
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
The game is over.

170
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
The Chessmen

171
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
has already

172
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
suppressed the Wude.

173
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
They have no way to return the power.

174
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Is the bot lane good?

175
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
I'm coming.

176
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
I'm coming.

177
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Let's fight.

178
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Go.

179
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
The Chessmen

180
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
has already started the fight.

181
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
The Chessmen

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
has just been killed.

183
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
Give me a head.

184
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm so tired.

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm scared.

186
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
You took my head.

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
I won't be with you again.

188
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Be careful.

189
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Be careful.

190
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Don't forget this.

191
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
I can't forget.

192
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
At least don't remind me.

193
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
The first round is god.

194
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
The seal is sealed.

195
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
The bot lane

196
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
is very strong.

197
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
It's strong.

198
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
It's strong.

199
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
The last game

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
was completely defeated.

201
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I won.

202
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
I won.

203
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Look.

204
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
My woman won.

205
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Fine.

206
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
What do you mean?

207
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Why are you still fighting?

208
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
It's just

209
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
for the Chessmen

210
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
to take a head.

211
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Don't be excited.

212
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
That's not easy.

213
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
You used to be

214
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
really comfortable.

215
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Do you know

216
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
there's a way up in the game?

217
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
The opponent is Hao Yunlan.

218
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
He took a buff

219
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
and suppressed me.

220
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
It's hard to win.

221
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
How can I fight?

222
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Old Pei.

223
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
You fought with me

224
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
but you're so good.

225
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
You didn't even come.

226
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
You're really a dog.

227
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
We're not even a team.

228
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Okay.

229
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Who?

230
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
The next round.

231
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
The next round.

232
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Okay.

233
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
I'll come now.

234
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Let's go.

235
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
I'll leave you and the cat

236
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
to push the top lane.

237
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Okay.

238
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
The last round

239
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Hao Yunlan didn't have a big move.

240
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
He was still crisp.

241
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
The first round

242
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
was a good time.

243
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
But the god of the flower

244
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
and the god of the sun

245
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
were also on the way.

246
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
The two teams

247
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
were also on the way

248
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
to the small gate.

249
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
The cat and the two teams

250
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
attacked Hao Yunlan.

251
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
The second and third consecutive games

252
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
were a good time.

253
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
The cat and the sun

254
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
were on the way.

255
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
A big snake.

256
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
I got it.

257
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Here it comes.

258
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Old Keba is keeping the wall.

259
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Xiaopang is keeping the big one.

260
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Why do I feel that

261
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
the Chessmen Team

262
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
is so fast today?

263
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
My god.

264
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
What a speed.

265
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
The eye is shaking.

266
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
It's steady.

267
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Let's play it today.

268
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Let's play it today.

269
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,360
Go to the middle and push the high ground.

270
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,520
Okay, hold on.

271
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,200
Push the middle one.

272
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,560
Go, go, go, go.

273
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
Go, go, go.

274
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,960
The DGDX has started to push the middle.

275
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
Is it impossible to win?

276
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,120
The DGDX has pushed the high ground.

277
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,200
They have pushed the high ground.

278
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,920
Come on.

279
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,440
DGD.

280
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
It's over.

281
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,040
It's too fast.

282
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,760
It's over.

283
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
It's too fast.

284
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,120
It's over.

285
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,360
Congratulations to DGDX.

286
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,320
They won the first round of the show.

287
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,560
It's too fast.

288
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,680
Na Li, you really are

289
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,400
a great player.

290
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,720
You are the best player in China.

291
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,720
It's okay.

292
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,560
It's okay.

293
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,320
This is a great performance.

294
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
Yang Shen, what's wrong with you?

295
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
You were not in a good condition in that match.

296
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,840
You didn't take the slow shot

297
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,400
but didn't get the signal from your teammates.

298
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,360
You didn't give them the signal

299
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,400
to the opponent as if they didn't want money.

300
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,680
You didn't give them the signal

301
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,400
to the opponent as if they didn't want money.

302
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,600
Sorry, coach.

303
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,040
I didn't mean you to apologize.

304
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,920
I meant you to

305
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
cheer me up in the next match.

306
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,960
In the last match,

307
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,840
DGDX used fast-speed to make a shot.

308
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,800
I didn't know

309
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
the condition of the next match.

310
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,480
So we should

311
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,840
delay their shot.

312
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,040
Okay?

313
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
I got it.

314
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,200
Xiao Wan.

315
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,200
Don't get too close to Simei.

316
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,640
Yang Shen.

317
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,680
It feels like

318
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,200
the old man and his girlfriend are holding hands.

319
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,240
Is it like

320
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,000
the white vegetables in the house

321
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
are being chopped into pieces?

322
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Does it hurt?

323
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,440
No.

324
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
It's a psychological shock.

325
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,000
Look.

326
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,560
I've seen it.

327
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,360
It's over.

328
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,400
Did you see the Weibo?

329
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,560
Jing Quan Yang's workplace said

330
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
there are two

331
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
unreachable fans in the CGDX.

332
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,240
Really?

333
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
I've never seen it.

334
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,400
Interesting.

335
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
That's too funny.

336
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,240
Simei.

337
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,960
Why are you wearing makeup

338
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,040
when you don't watch Weibo?

339
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,920
You're watching the game.

340
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,960
No one is watching you.

341
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,560
I have more

342
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,760
beautiful fans

343
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,560
who are interested in me.

344
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,040
Miss.

345
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,200
Your idol package

346
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
is heavier than the whole box.

347
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,960
I think you're

348
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,520
being told by K.

349
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,200
You're talking about fans.

350
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
Don't cue me.

351
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,840
What's wrong with me?

352
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,800
You're boring.

353
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,880
I need to learn the speed math.

354
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,680
Not only that,

355
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,520
but at all.

356
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,840
Don't worry.

357
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,680
Brother Cheng,

358
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
are you angry?

359
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,280
I'm doing it fast now.

360
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,840
Really?

361
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,160
Do I

362
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,040
have a heart attack?

363
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,080
What should I do

364
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,240
after the game?

365
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,340
got limitedy better,

366
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,400
missed but got even better.

367
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,840
T booster,

368
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,740
lead by işin.

369
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,020
Only the best Turbo fusion

370
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,640
has a lower point seat.

371
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,160
Need to glued it to the ground

372
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,960
for an shin's stCtee.

373
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,640
get up there and split angle it.

374
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,800
It's so exciting.

375
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,280
Who's playing this game?

376
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,560
What the hell ...

377
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,700
Who are you playing

378
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,120
what was in mind

379
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,180
Who's playing this game

380
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,580
The Yang Xiaozi's blood is on the ground.

381
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,140
He's got a head of a person who cut off the chain.

382
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,580
The little fat guy's face is in a state of emergency.

383
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,380
He's running away.

384
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,780
The Fibo Secret is also very close.

385
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,380
Shuai, Shuai, Shuai.

386
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,380
Nice, nice, nice.

387
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,980
Nice, nice.

388
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,580
Nice, nice.

389
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,380
Captain, are you okay?

390
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,180
I'm fine.

391
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,580
Little Fatty, go to the other road.

392
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,780
I'll send the rain down.

393
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,380
Okay.

394
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,580
Then be careful.

395
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:58,780
Come here.

396
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,580
Turn the car off.

397
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,380
Okay, okay, okay.

398
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,580
Nice, nice, nice.

399
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,780
Hey, you said that the CK team

400
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,980
is going to fight the big snake.

401
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,980
Is it dangerous to open now?

402
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,180
It should be.

403
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,780
Look, the Chessmen just recovered.

404
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,380
And the ice in the CK's way is also very good.

405
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
They're opening the big snake.

406
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,980
Don't go first.

407
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,780
Wait for us together.

408
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,580
If the CK wants to open the team,

409
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,380
we'll fight four times.

410
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,580
According to the data,

411
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,980
ZGDX is in the middle of the game.

412
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,780
Where's the Smyo Lin?

413
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,180
Do you want to fight one to five?

414
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,180
It's coming.

415
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,180
Smyo Lin is in the middle.

416
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,780
Don't go.

417
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,980
Don't go.

418
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,580
Be careful.

419
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,380
Be careful, Hu Die.

420
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,380
Smyo Lin is in the middle.

421
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,980
The only spot for the fox is the big snake.

422
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
Old Cat, come here.

423
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,780
We can take over this time.

424
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,980
Okay, I'm coming now.

425
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,380
I'm coming.

426
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,980
I'm on the way.

427
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
The fake hand.

428
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
The snake is in the middle.

429
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,180
The three-level beast is in the middle.

430
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,980
Smyo Lin is in the middle.

431
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,780
The two-level beast is in the middle.

432
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,580
The two-level beast is in the middle.

433
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,380
Keep fighting.

434
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,980
Don't run.

435
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,380
The old king is opening the big snake.

436
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,180
ZGDX is coming.

437
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,780
Wei Ying is in the middle.

438
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,380
Smyo Lin is in the middle.

439
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Smyo Lin is in the middle.

440
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,380
He is in the middle.

441
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,380
But Hu Die is in the middle.

442
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,380
The key is to keep the small fox safe.

443
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
Hu Die is in the middle.

444
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
Three kills.

445
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,980
What are they doing?

446
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Let's go.

447
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,580
Let's go.

448
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,180
Let's go.

449
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,380
Miss, you are so good.

450
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,180
My god.

451
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Let's go back and fight the big snake.

452
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,580
Okay.

453
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,380
ZGDX is in the middle.

454
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Lu Xu is dead.

455
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
This one-level beast is in the middle.

456
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
ZGDX is in the middle.

457
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
The team is really beautiful.

458
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,780
Yes.

459
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,380
Smyo Lin is really fierce.

460
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
He is not a good guy.

461
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,180
And the big one-level beast is perfect.

462
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,980
He is not the first one to meet the big one.

463
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
We can push the tower directly.

464
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Okay.

465
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,980
Here comes the big one.

466
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Brother Cheng, can I go and sell it?

467
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,980
The fat one is not big.

468
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
Five seconds.

469
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,580
Okay.

470
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
I will sell it.

471
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,980
Three, two, one.

472
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Go.

473
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
Take the bag.

474
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
Take the bag.

475
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Don't worry.

476
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
ZGDX is in the middle.

477
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,980
The next team wants to win.

478
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,980
I will retreat first.

479
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,980
You guys go and hold on.

480
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,980
Don't worry.

481
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,980
I am here to fight the big one.

482
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
You can lose.

483
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
Two seconds.

484
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Two seconds.

485
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Take the tower.

486
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
The tower is important.

487
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
Go.

488
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
KG, go.

489
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,980
Go.

490
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Go.

491
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
Go.

492
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
Double kill.

493
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,980
Baili and Da Zou are in the middle.

494
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
Go directly.

495
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Don't pull the line so hard.

496
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Pull it gently.

497
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Go back to the water.

498
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
The big one is in the middle.

499
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
Don't look at the big one.

500
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Go.

501
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,980
The tower.

502
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Go directly.

503
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
The tower is in the middle.

504
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
Go.

505
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
Congratulations to ZGDX.

506
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
You can win.

507
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,980
ZGDX.

508
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Yes.

509
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
ZGDX, you are in the middle.

510
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,980
Yes.

511
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,980
The ZGDX is so fierce.

512
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,980
In the bad situation,

513
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,980
ZGDX still shows the fighting power of the tower.

514
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
So, Yu Zao Chen is really great.

515
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,980
He is really great.

516
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
This is great.

517
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,980
This time, he won.

518
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
I won, old man.

519
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,980
My daughter is really great.

520
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,980
Of course.

521
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
I don't know who's daughter.

522
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
You don't object?

523
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
All right.

524
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,980
It's your turn.

525
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Come on.

526
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
Feng Yao.

527
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
Old Kai.

528
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
Sorry.

529
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
I'm so nervous today.

530
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
I just want to say

531
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
you played well.

532
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
Thank you.

533
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Let's go.

534
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,980
Let's go.

535
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,980
Thank you.

536
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
Thank you.

537
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Thank you.

538
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,980
Song Zhe.

539
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
You are strong.

540
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,980
Yes.

541
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
So, I will play with you often.

542
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Until you retire.

543
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
Let go.

544
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
No gift.

545
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
See you in the next match.

546
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,980
Come on.

547
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
Let's welcome Chessman and Smelling

548
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
to our interview.

549
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
Welcome, Tong Yao and Cheng Ge.

550
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
Today, you two

551
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
have won two-game MVP.

552
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
I want to ask you something.

553
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
I heard you were nervous

554
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
before the match.

555
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
You were on the way to the match.

556
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
Is that true?

557
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
I...

558
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
It's normal to be nervous

559
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
when you are nervous

560
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,980
when you are on the first match.

561
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
I want to ask you something.

562
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Is the match today

563
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
for the spring match?

564
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
No.

565
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
It's normal.

566
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Then, Cheng Ge,

567
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
please evaluate

568
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
the performance of

569
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
the new Lu Smelling

570
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
in today's match.

571
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
The second match today,

572
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
she won MVP.

573
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
Do you think she is in a good mood?

574
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Not bad.

575
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Okay.

576
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
Thank you for your interview.

577
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Thank you, Cheng Ge.

578
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Thank you, Tong Yao.

579
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Thank you, friends.

580
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
Today's match

581
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,980
ends here.

582
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
The last team

583
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,980
has four players on the way.

584
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
I will go in and...

585
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
I am here.

586
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
I will wait for you.

587
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
There is a question.

588
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
I can not play...

589
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
Where is Cheng Ge?

590
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
Cheng Ge, I will go back first.

591
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
You need to clean up.

592
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
Don't be late

593
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
for the New Year's event.

594
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
What's wrong?

595
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Brother Rui.

596
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
What event is that?

597
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,980
Can I not go?

598
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
What's wrong with you?

599
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
You are going to be a disaster for Cheng Ge.

600
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,980
I...

601
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
I...

602
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
My pants are dirty.

603
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
You are pulling my pants?

604
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
You are pulling my pants?

605
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,980
I am not.

606
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
I am not.

607
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
I am close.

608
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Hi.

609
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
I just sent Cheng Ge back

610
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
with low-end

611
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
traffic light.

612
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
I think she is not far away yet.

613
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
I will ask her to come back.

614
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Master.

615
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Yes.

616
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Master.

617
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
Please come back.

618
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
There is another Prince of Zheng

619
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
on our side.

620
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,980
Right.

621
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,980
I am sorry.

622
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,980
Come right away.

623
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Wait a minute.

624
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
Thank you, Brother Rui.

625
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
What's wrong?

626
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
The manager said he would come back

627
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
to pick up someone.

628
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,980
What's wrong?

629
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
I am not feeling well.

630
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
I am very deep in my heart.

631
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,980
I am here to take care of you.

632
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,980
I have a fever.

633
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
But I have a headache.

634
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
What's wrong?

635
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,980
My pants are dirty.

636
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,980
Come on.

637
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,980
Let me take your pants.

638
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,980
Stay away from me.

639
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
You can't smell the oil in your nose.

640
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Can I see it with your eyes?

641
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
What?

642
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
Miss.

643
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
Don't forget to wear your safety belt.

644
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Okay.

645
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Master Li.

646
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
Master.

647
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,980
Why are you here?

648
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
What a coincidence.

649
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Do you want to consider

650
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,980
your brother's car

651
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
as my private car?

652
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Actually,

653
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,980
it doesn't matter if people buy or not.

654
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
With our car,

655
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
you have a private car.

656
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
Not only the environmental protection and greenery,

657
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
but also the parking fee.

658
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Right?

659
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
Yes.

660
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
Hello, Jingyang.

661
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,980
I am telling you.

662
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
You are so handsome today.

663
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Where are you?

664
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
You are not getting any attention.

665
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
I am just looking at you.

666
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
I am going to the chicken restaurant.

667
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
Why don't you say it now?

668
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
Come on. Sit down.

669
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
Get the car ready.

670
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
Okay.

671
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
I am going to the national championship

672
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
and the national competition.

673
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,980
After the competition,

674
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
I will be the first to win.

675
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
I will not let

676
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,980
the spirit of the god of the sun

677
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,980
go away.

678
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
I will watch it

679
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
with my eyes open.

680
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,980
The spirit of the god of the sun

681
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
will be sent up.

682
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Hurry up.

683
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Look at Cheng Ke's car.

684
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
It is a car.

685
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
It is a car.

686
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
It is a car.

687
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,980
It is a car.

688
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
It is a car.

689
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
He has got a car.

690
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
He will not go away.

691
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,980
He is a man.

692
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
He won't eat it himself.

693
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
He won't eat it.

694
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,980
He can't eat it alone.

695
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
He is sick.

696
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
Then we are out of captains.

697
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Ningsheng and Fatty can't serve it.

698
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
No one helps you

699
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
when you and Lu Yue were fighting.

700
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
Fatty can't manage Lu Yue.

701
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,420
He eats. appreciate duty.

702
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,100
Where are you going?

703
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,480
Looks yummy.

704
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,260
Club president, I wanna�

705
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,580
Good night

706
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,900
Goodbye

707
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,940
your name

708
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,820
to me

709
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,120
My brother

710
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,980
brand Salvador

711
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,260
which of short

712
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,420
You can finish it.

713
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,220
Here.

714
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,540
The water is too big.

715
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,260
It's a heart attack.

716
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,220
You know what?

717
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,260
Women suffer from pain every month.

718
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,060
Three times more is like a pain when they are separated.

719
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,420
Do you know how painful it is to have a girl?

720
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,300
It's like you're going to put your mouth up

721
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,500
and cover your whole head.

722
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,500
It's probably the same.

723
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,180
So every time at this time,

724
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,540
even if you put your body in the earth,

725
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,220
I can still put it in the sea.

726
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,540
It's because it disturbed me

727
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,780
to be a quiet beauty.

728
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,340
So drink water, take medicine, don't do it.

729
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,220
One more sip.

730
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,300
You need to drink more hot water when you're sick.

731
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,300
By the way,

732
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,940
you can't take medicine for free.

733
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,260
I'm a little late.

734
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,100
What do you want to eat?

735
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,260
I want to die.

736
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,140
You can't die.

737
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,820
It's just that it's not the right time.

738
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,420
Your Majesty,

739
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,220
you have to die

740
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,020
after you die in Lu Yue's mess.

741
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,420
What do you want to eat?

742
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,260
Fried rice with yellow rice and white chili.

743
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,980
Japanese dishes and Korean dishes.

744
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,100
You can't say no.

745
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,100
Why are you so good at stomach pain?

746
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,700
And why do you have stomach pain?

747
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,460
I'm giving you a tip.

748
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,580
I want to drink porridge.

749
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,620
I also want to drink porridge.

750
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,220
I want to drink the porridge with white porridge.

751
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
Just order it.

752
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,020
The porridge in the main room

753
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,060
is all for yourself.

754
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,020
What's wrong?

755
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,260
There's no porridge in these porridge stores.

756
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,460
The only few are not good for the evaluation.

757
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,740
Forget it.

758
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,460
Just order it.

759
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,860
I can't drink porridge that's not cooked outside.

760
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,980
You go to bed first.

761
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,860
I'll call you when the porridge is ready.

762
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,940
Forced food is also not good for you.

763
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,460
If I call you tomorrow,

764
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,980
and you give me the Fourier Hajjapak.

765
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,300
It's work.

766
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,500
There's no need.

767
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,980
Good work, Your Majesty.

768
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,460
Goodbye, Your Highness.

769
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,500
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

770
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,540
You're not going to ask me God's help?

771
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,660
What are you doing?

772
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,060
Why did you come down?

773
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,500
If you want to drink water,

774
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,220
send me a WeChat message.

775
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,500
I'll send it to you.

776
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,660
Get out.

777
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
You have to cut it.

778
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,940
What's going on?

779
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,260
When Ge Sili went into the capital,

780
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,620
women should not have water in their lair.

781
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,040
It's nice to hear that.

782
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,980
Please let me know.

783
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,860
I'm going to use it first.

784
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,740
I will get inside first.

785
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,100
This house is very Sacred Landry-Consol.

786
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,980
A Sacred Landry,

787
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,340
is very Perfect Landry.

788
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,380
Msemb winning the game of cards

789
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,140
on your own.

790
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,760
Want to play cheerleading?

791
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,040
Go.

792
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,420
Let's go.

793
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,220
Do you guys goели play league?

794
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,300
Not really,

795
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,660
I can't be읊 except青 win team.

796
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,680
Cut.

797
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,060
Zhang Yixing,

798
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,160
They are marchers

799
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,420
who came by the school map.

800
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,700
The game is not over yet.

801
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,600
Yes.

802
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,500
Turn around.

803
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,180
You must be tired.

804
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,500
So you're going to be a master in the future.

805
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,820
You won't go home even if it's hot.

806
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,620
You're really great.

807
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,620
I won't easily find someone to fall in love with.

808
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,260
Yes.

809
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,100
You don't look like you like humans.

810
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,060
What did you say?

811
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,020
I don't like humans.

812
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,420
I like games.

813
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,420
If you want me to fall in love with you,

814
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,940
I hope to find someone who is bigger than me.

815
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,260
I'm not a human.

816
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,420
A human who is better than the game of Chansman.

817
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,060
A woman?

818
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,980
Am I wrong?

819
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,100
Oh, no.

820
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,500
Brother Cheng either doesn't like women

821
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,300
or doesn't like humans.

822
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,260
What do you mean?

823
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,220
He wants to find someone better in the game that he plays.

824
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,540
Do you think you can thousandter him

825
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,140
in the Russian style?

826
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,460
Maybe steering is so important in the game?

827
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,020
You should eat if you feel mad.

828
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,060
Have some water after you iron your pant.

829
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,900
Okay.

830
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,340
Why are you here?

831
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,820
I'm just sleeping.

832
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,860
I haven't recovered.

833
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,940
What are you doing?

834
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,700
I'm watching the live broadcast.

835
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,020
Am I too noisy

836
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,340
in this live broadcast?

837
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
Sorry.

838
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,100
I'll turn off the sound.

839
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,900
Go to sleep.

840
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,580
No need.

841
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,180
I thought you were burned by Zhou.

842
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,900
How is that possible?

843
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,780
I'm not that...

844
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,580
You won't be able to get a hot water tank.

845
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,540
How do I know that there's a hot water tank?

846
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,740
You don't ask. How do you know?

847
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,580
Wait for me here.

848
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,820
As a man with a power,

849
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,900
Cheng is really not that good in the competition.

850
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,980
Besides the necessary instructions,

851
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,540
most of the time,

852
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,820
he does his own thing quietly.

853
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,060
He listens to his teammates' nonsense

854
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,140
and talks to the camera.

855
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,740
It's also possible that he has a automatic flat-ground function.

856
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,460
He doesn't listen to their nonsense

857
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
or anything.

858
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,820
Here.

859
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,700
This is...

860
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,700
The fan gave it to you.

861
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,220
How can it be like this?

862
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,780
It suddenly touched your belly.

863
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,180
You can't touch the old belly.

864
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,340
It's in the ancient belt.

865
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,820
You're going to marry me like this?

866
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,100
I thought I was doing something good.

867
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,700
Why did you accept such a punishment?

868
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,260
It's in the ancient belt.

869
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,460
I married you 800 times

870
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,060
and then I fixed you 800 times.

871
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,420
You fixed it and then you fixed 800 times again.

872
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Isn't that the sword?

873
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,060
I don't know.

874
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,820
Maybe I'm a little blind.

875
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:00,980
On the other hand,

876
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,940
the fan is really cool.

877
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,180
D Macao.

878
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,060
What is it?

879
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,580
Brother Cheng.

880
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,740
I'm sorry.

881
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,460
I took care of you as a animate.

882
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,180
As a result, it turned out that you took care of me.

883
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,900
What?

884
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,980
Do you think you're going to give me

885
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
some medicine?

886
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:31,780
Zeyou, let's go.

887
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,700
I'll take care of you.

888
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,180
This time.

889
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,060
Are you hungry?

890
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,780
Yes.

891
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,620
Forget it.

892
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,580
I don't want a person with a face-to-face

893
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,660
to take me to my room.

894
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,580
But you need to.

895
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,500
I don't need to.

896
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,260
You need to.

897
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:41,900
I don't need to.

898
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,820
You need to.

899
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,780
Let's go.

900
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,300
I don't need to.

901
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,700
You need to.

902
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,340
You need to.

903
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,420
I really don't need to.

904
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,420
I'll go back to work.

905
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,060
Zeyou.

906
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,540
I don't need to.

907
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,380
You need to.

908
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,220
I need to.

909
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,060
You need to.

910
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,900
I don't need to.

911
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,140
Hurry.

912
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,780
You're back.

913
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:25,780
Come on.

914
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,500
We're back.

915
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,900
We brought you delicious food.

916
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,020
Where's he?

917
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,060
Did he take the medicine and fall asleep?

918
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,700
I need to check on him.

919
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,340
Don't worry.

920
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,660
What are you doing?

921
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,500
Are you a dog?

922
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,780
Did my brother die?

923
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,100
Really?

924
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,620
Yes.

925
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,140
No.

926
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
What are you doing?

927
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,020
What's wrong?

928
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,860
Did you see a ghost?

929
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,820
It's more scary than a ghost.

930
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,500
What?

931
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,300
I'm going to chase after a dream.

932
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,300
I'm going to chase after the light.

933
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,300
I'm going to chase after the light.

934
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,700
If I chase after a dream,

935
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,020
I'm going to chase after the light.

936
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,460
So we're going to go forward.
