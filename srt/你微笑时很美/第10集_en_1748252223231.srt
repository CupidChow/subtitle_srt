1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What's going on?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What's going on?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
When we get the new person,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'll make an appointment with Xiaorui.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Looks like we've found a new person.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Wait for the official announcement.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're a big star.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Call Huang Lan.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm here.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bi Jinghe.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm here.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm here.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm here.

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Nice.

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nice.

17
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Good job.

18
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're good.

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you want to be as good as the others,

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
we'll work harder.

21
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm here.

22
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Good job, everyone.

23
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Coach.

24
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Next time,

25
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
we'll go to Chess Man.

26
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Really?

27
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes.

28
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you sure?

29
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

30
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Chess Man.

31
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Coach.

32
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Next time, you go upstairs.

33
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Good luck, Chess Man.

34
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Chess Man.

35
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Chess Man.

36
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Chess Man.

37
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Chess Man.

38
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Thank you.

39
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's going on?

40
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
From the next match,

41
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
we'll go back to Chess Man.

42
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Please support us.

43
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's news.

44
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Take a picture.

45
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Take a picture.

46
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Chess Man.

47
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What do you think about this?

48
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How do you feel?

49
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Thank you.

50
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

51
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I announce that

52
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cheng Ge is my man.

53
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm the one who won the title.

54
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm the one who won the title.

55
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There are information that

56
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the Chinese telecom company is over 2 billion

57
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and is still in the top 20.

58
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
However,

59
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the telecom industry is becoming a big area.

60
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The telecom industry is in a lack of people.

61
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's becoming a new platform for the telecom industry.

62
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
For the telecom industry,

63
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the excellent professional players,

64
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
telecom players,

65
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
game manufacturers and other professional players

66
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
are expected to reach 200 million people.

67
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't you feel bad?

68
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Follow me.

69
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have to go.

70
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Chess Man.

71
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Who do you think will go up with me

72
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
in the first game of the next season?

73
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I have something to tell you.

74
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Should I go home?

75
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're leaving me?

76
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're going to continue playing pro games

77
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
even if you go back?

78
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll keep playing pro games.

79
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll give you all the opportunities

80
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
that I can give you.

81
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I hope you do this.

82
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Give me when you meet me again.

83
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Chess Man.

84
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
See you at the stadium.

85
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
See you at the stadium.

86
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Chess Man.

87
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm so tired.

88
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Are you in a hurry?

89
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What is it?

90
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm called Huang Diu.

91
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where?

92
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
After the training match,

93
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I went to the stadium with him.

94
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I lost my ability to play.

95
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I couldn't find him.

96
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Chess Man.

97
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't know what to do now.

98
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I lost my official Korean foreign player.

99
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How can I tell the fans

100
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
about the game?

101
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Chess Man, go out.

102
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm going to play with you.

103
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm going to play with you.

104
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I lost my coach Huang in the stadium.

105
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm going to find him.

106
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You lost your coach Huang.

107
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why did you go there?

108
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
His reaction was urgent and went home.

109
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I can't communicate with him now.

110
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You just finished the game and went shopping.

111
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What kind of operation?

112
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
By the way, it's going to rain outside.

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Remember to wear a umbrella.

114
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But what about you two?

115
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Or one?

116
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What do you mean?

117
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You will catch a cold.

118
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You know,

119
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
even if you do this to me,

120
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I won't change my attitude.

121
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Good luck.

122
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Brother Cheng, what should we do?

123
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What should we do?

124
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We can't see the coach Huang.

125
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why did you come to China?

126
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because of him.

127
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The support you brought to me,

128
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm very happy.

129
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm very happy.

130
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm very happy.

131
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm very happy.

132
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm very happy.

133
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm very happy.

134
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm very happy.

135
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm very happy.

136
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm very happy.

137
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The support you brought to me,

138
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
it's okay.

139
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's very special.

140
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm very happy.

141
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I sent you to China

142
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
because I couldn't get a chance to play in China.

143
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I won the match in China.

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're going to win?

145
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You're not going to play in the training game

146
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
after the start of the game?

147
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm going to be very generous.

148
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I won't lose next time.

149
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The national game is about to start.

150
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
See you then.

151
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll be looking forward to it.

152
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If you lose,

153
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I won't come to your house.

154
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But,

155
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you'll come to your house with your trust.

156
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The person who lost the game in the department store

157
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
is interested in our trust.

158
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's an opportunity.

159
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's okay to trust your team.

160
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Of course.

161
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Come on, Xiao Pang.

162
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Come on.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Xiao Pang.

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Xiao Pang.

165
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Xiao Pang.

166
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Come on.

167
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's your turn.

168
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Why are you hitting me?

169
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The weather has changed.

170
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I can't let people down.

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I hope Brother Cheng will drive the car.

172
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
My brother is sending you to the airport?

173
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Think about it.

174
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If Brother Cheng is going to be taken to the airport,

175
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
he'll be a little bit suspicious.

176
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Right?

177
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Everyone,

178
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Brother Cheng didn't take you to the airport.

179
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He's at the next mall.

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Let's continue.

181
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's continue.

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Let's go.

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm fine.

184
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm very busy.

185
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No, it's your fault.

186
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Remember to bring more.

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The next station is also not in the bag.

188
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And,

189
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Brother Cheng also took you to the mall

190
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
to buy the food.

191
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you want to know the news?

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Is it him?

193
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm Bai Er.

194
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't worry.

195
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Go.

196
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Fine. I'll go.

197
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But I want to bring a 20-minute call.

198
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Because I'm short-tempered.

199
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I hope that in this period,

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
he won't be killed.

201
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Go.

202
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Be careful.

203
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How many?

204
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Come on.

205
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come on.

206
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hello,

207
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the number you're trying to call is powered off.

208
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Sorry,

209
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
this is Dr. Insaniel's power off.

210
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Miss Sally.

211
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Miss Sally.

212
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Miss Sally.

213
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Miss Sally.

214
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Miss Sally.

215
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Miss Sally.

216
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Miss Sally.

217
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Miss Sally.

218
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Miss Sally.

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Miss Sally.

220
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Miss Sally.

221
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Miss Sally.

222
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Miss Sally.

223
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Why are you here?

224
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I found you.

225
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Where's our AD?

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
With my AD.

227
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Here.

228
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Go.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's true that if a man is not a goddess,

230
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
he must be another man.

231
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You're here.

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I told you to stay outside.

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Now you're here.

234
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Sorry for waiting so long.

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll give you the doll.

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If you don't mind,

237
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll wait for you.

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll give you this doll.

239
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What are you looking at?

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Nothing.

241
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'll give you this.

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Here.

243
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well,

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm leaving.

245
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Look.

246
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's go.

247
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Go.

248
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Go back and wash your face.

249
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Go and take a rest.

250
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Tomorrow,

251
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
you're going to be the first of the National Festival.

252
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't catch a cold.

253
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right.

254
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Tomorrow, you'll do it.

255
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,760
to the national team.

256
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,040
But even if it's not us,

257
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,440
it's CK.

258
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,640
But CK doesn't have

259
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,840
a bad team like you.

260
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,880
We won the training match

261
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,680
in the national team.

262
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,600
CK?

263
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,440
No.

264
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,440
Kevin.

265
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,560
You won CK.

266
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,600
You're so good.

267
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,640
Did the kids hear that?

268
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,400
They said they can't win.

269
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,680
Look at them.

270
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,560
See?

271
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
They're fighting.

272
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,520
So arrogant.

273
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,120
Who are you to?

274
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm JR右衔.

275
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm really afraid of Soccer.

276
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,320
Look at the stadium.

277
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,320
Look at theельting.

278
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,840
Zhao Jiangxiao

279
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,040
Ji Zhong

280
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,360
You still have many videos of this month

281
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,920
Come have Ban same

282
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Where do you get real videos

283
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,160
it is back

284
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,920
Didn't you two take the浣

285
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,080
why are you not in your position

286
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,720
4 people are all cold

287
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,680
It's raining heavily

288
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,640
what's the point

289
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,240
Cut the noise

290
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,600
I don't know.

291
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,040
I just took your medicine.

292
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,240
It's a first-aid business tomorrow.

293
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,080
Don't go there.

294
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,480
It's just a cold.

295
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,320
What medicine?

296
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,360
I'll go to get some warm water.

297
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,840
What's this?

298
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,840
Brother Cheng's coat.

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I said this.

300
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,800
Tofu?

301
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,720
Where do you get that?

302
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,840
We have to thank Brother Cheng.

303
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,160
In the children's amusement park,

304
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,600
two people from the next door

305
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,240
and four-meter-high comrades

306
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,160
are in the same place.

307
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,600
They're in the city before the war.

308
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,920
How about the whole mall?

309
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,960
All the lights are on.

310
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,280
That's how the rabbit came.

311
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,120
These players are smart.

312
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,400
They're really good at catching these things.

313
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,480
Brother Cheng is so smart.

314
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,040
He didn't even give me a rabbit.

315
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,080
Give it to me.

316
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,080
No.

317
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,800
Take it.

318
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,760
No.

319
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,320
Take it.

320
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,080
Mo Mo.

321
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,560
Do you think Brother Cheng will be able to catch A-sports or B-sports?

322
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,280
What do you think?

323
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,120
I heard that today's host

324
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
has a little sister.

325
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,880
She seems to be a girlfriend of Ai's.

326
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,600
Really?

327
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,520
I hope she can bring us good luck.

328
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,600
It's my father that the host is talking about today.

329
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,920
I know.

330
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:27,720
To me.

331
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,440
Remember to watch out.

332
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,360
Don't let her go.

333
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,760
Is it true that you keep doctors in one's mind?

334
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,480
This big screen will 나타�n

335
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,200
your title as A-sports Red core fighter later on.

336
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,280
Nice!

337
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,920
What are they doing?

338
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,960
Watch what you say.

339
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Thank you!

340
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,840
Dear audience.

341
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,080
Hello, everyone.

342
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,280
I'm the host of Today's Chou Qian Yi.

343
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,200
Xiao Sen.

344
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,040

Let's have a look at the next part.

347
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,560
Let's have a look at the rules of Chou Qian Yi.

348
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,600
Please look at the screen.

349
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,120
According to the 2020

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
The Grand Final of the Grand Final

351
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,040
There are four types of food.

352
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,600
The first and second are the five types of food.

353
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,640
The third and sixth are the two types of food.

354
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,280
The seventh and the tenth are the three types of food.

355
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,480
We're in that category.

356
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,280
The third and second are the three types of food.

357
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,880
According to the rules of the A and B groups,

358
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Chou Qian Yi will be the first to enter.

359
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,840
First, let's welcome the two teams of the first group

360
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,520
to enter the stage.

361
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,120
Because the C&K team is the champion of the Chou Qian Yi Tournament,

362
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,840
the first and first teams to enter the stage

363
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,440

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
please sit down and come up to the stage.

371
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Let's go.

Come on.

373
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Come on.

374
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Come on.

375
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
A group.

376
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Okay, thank you.

377
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520

Welcome.

381
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Why is Chen's expression so scary?

382
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
What happened?

383
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
It looks like a murderous fight.

384
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Yes.

385
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Chen, what's wrong with your face?

386
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Don't cough.

387
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
It's not a problem.

388
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
It's too bad.

389
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
So you're so angry.

390
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
You're black like a pot.

391
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
You're just not coughing because you don't want to cough.

392
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Why do you have so many idols?

393
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Chen, are you sure you don't need to take the medicine?

394
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
I don't.

395
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
But there are two days left to play the game.

396
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
You're so stubborn.

397
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
Why are you only drinking?

398
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
It's good to drink after the game.

399
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Bai Cao.

400
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
What's wrong with you and the C&K team?

401
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
It's not over yet.

402
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
What's your expression?

403
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,520
What's wrong with Bai Cao?

404
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
It's over.

405
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
It's so far away.

406
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
And we're not in the same team.

407
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
If we meet them,

408
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
we'll have to play the final game.

409
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
We'll play the full-color show.

410
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,520
Next, let's welcome the last team today.

when you have the final nervous.

452
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Lu Yue, I'm fine.

The data is objective.

469
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm still a little bit worse than the guy in the real world.

470
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
I can't do much.

471
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I have the confidence to surpass him.

472
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520

I can't control it.

The King is the birthplace of Spring.

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,520
I heard that their score is 80% higher than the fans.

00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,520
And they've played the Baoji game like the next door.

But now they can play CK.

What's the possibility?

487
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Forget it.

488
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Accept it.

489
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,580

This is called a trick to win and defeat.

00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,520
It's really a trick.

541
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
It's a trick.

542
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,360
You hit a front-line guy and he's still working.

543
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,520
That's because he doesn't want to be embarrassed in front of his lover.

544
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,200
Miss, what's wrong with you?

545

You don't want to...

548
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,080

Oh, good.

557
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,600
It's the first time to defend...

558
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,040
It's different from my years.

559
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,760
Then how many of you are there?

560
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,520

Finally, we see the face of Lu Shan.

565
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
The defense team is very cute.

566
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
And the gold card is supporting Xiao Fat.

567
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,060
Like Fat's mother,

568
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,060
he is very worried.

569
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,060
Okay, the last one is

570
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,060
our ADC God, Chen Fan.

571
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,060
Welcome to the final round.

572
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,060
Okay, now our two teams are ready to go.

573
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Please welcome the two teams to your seats.

574
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,460
Ready to fight for the guests.

575
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,460
Hello, I am the host, Chen Jingyang.

576
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,460
Today, I am very honored to invite Xiao Fan and Chen Yang.

577
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Let's have a match of the national team.

578
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,860
Hello, everyone. I am the host, Xiao Fan.

579
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,860
Hello, I am the host, Chen Yang.

580
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,860
Today, we are going to have a match of the national team.

581
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,860
What is the most important thing about the cosplaying?

582
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,860
Do you usually like cosplaying?

583
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,860
No.

584
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,860
Miss, you are so nervous.

585
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,860
I am so nervous.

586
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,860
I am so nervous that I am going to spit out the food.

587
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
You are really nervous.

588
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
We don't have time to eat lunch today.

589
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,860
Why don't you take a break?

590
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,260
I am going to take a break.

591
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,260
We still have the driver.

592
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,260
Are you two looking forward to the match?

593
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,260
Yes, I think it's not just the two of us.

594
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,260
The fans and the netizens

595
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,260
are looking forward to the match.

596
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,260
CK vs ZGDX.

597
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,260
I think you all haven't forgotten that

598
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
during the spring match,

599
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
that scene is really called

600
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,260
a...

601
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,260
The wind and the rain.

602
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
Yes, it is the wind and the rain.

603
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,660
It seems that Miss Jingyang is very accurate.

604
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,660
Yes, yes, yes.

605
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,660
After all, the two teams

606
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,660
are really looking forward to the match.

607
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,660
Today's first match

608
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,660
is the final match of the ZGDX.

609
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
Can we complete the revenge of the spring match?

610
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
Can CK team

611
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
continue to write their victory?

612
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
And there is a very interesting thing.

613
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
Today, we just joined the ZGDX.

614
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Actually, you are a sister.

615
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
You are a sister.

616
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,660
You are a professional.

617
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,660
Don't listen to me.

618
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,060
I feel like I've seen many things.

619
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,060
Can't you focus on the screen?

620
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,060
But today, from the current situation,

621
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,060
we feel that

622
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Miss Jingyang seems to be a little nervous.

623
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
Do you think it's because

624
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,060
she is the only one who participated

625
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,060
in such a large-scale match?

626
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
It's the first time that anyone will be nervous

627
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
when playing the match.

628
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,060
It seems that there is no relationship between the girls.

629
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Yes.

630
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
Okay, the match has been recorded.

631
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
Let's see who will be the winner.

632
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,460
The battle is about to begin.

633
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,460
Come on, SNAIL.

634
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,460
The first one to win the title

635
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,460
is SNAIL.

636
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,460
It seems that they have enough customers.

637
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,460
This is not the usual SNAIL.

638
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,460
This is the first SNAIL in the country.

639
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,460
Let's move the good and bad.

640
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Okay, see you.

641
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,860
This is the second SNAIL.

642
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,860
The best SNAIL in the country.

643
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,860
It seems that they have a lot of customers.

644
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,860
Yes.

645
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,860
Yan Yanlu.

646
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Qing Feng.

647
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Oh my god.

648
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
Yan Yanlu has moved the four mid-levels

649
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,860
of Qing Qi and Bai Tong.

650
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Six of them have to use the four mid-levels

651
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,860
to restrict the other team.

652
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,860
It seems that this is the mid-level.

653
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
I think that

654
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,260
the two teams have to take the test.

655
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,260
The two teams' vision is more obvious.

656
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,260
What the hell?

657
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
If the vision is too obvious,

658
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,260
they really dare to fight.

659
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,260
I will tell you this.

660
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Send it to the one behind and watch the game.

661
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Come on, let's take the panic and the demon knife skills first.

662
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,260
Give me the demon tiger.

663
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Cheng Cheng, the other team's formation is not good.

664
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,260
The demon tiger is not good at the back.

665
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
You take the white wolf.

666
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,260
I said that the four mid-levels are the best.

667
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,660
What?

668
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Qian Feng chose the demon tiger.

669
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
It's very dangerous.

670
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
If he is the one who didn't fight in the previous season,

671
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
he will not fight in the next season.

672
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
I know.

673
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,660
He wants to fight in the next season.

674
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
It's too dangerous.

675
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
Okay, now you see the match.

676
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Let's see if CK chose

677
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
a top-level team.

678
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
The next team is the team of the Chinese team.

679
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,660
The team with the most points

680
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,060
will be defeated by CK.

681
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,060
The other team will be the top-level team.

682
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,060
The other team is all the top-level team.

683
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,060
We are all the top-level team.

684
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,060
I want to say that you are too arrogant.

685
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,060
I'm in a hurry.

686
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,060
I'll go to bed after I finish.

687
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,060
What's wrong with you?

688
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,060
My stomach hurts.

689
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,060
What?

690
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,060
It's like a big disaster in the world.

691
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,060
It's like a strong fire.

692
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,060
What?

693
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,060
You want to pull it?

694
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,460
I think you want to go on the race.

695
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,460
Race?

696
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,460
What's that?

697
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,460
Hey, guys.

698
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,460
You heard it?

699
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,460
Look, the middle-aged girl

700
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,460
is in the race for 30 seconds.

701
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,460
No, no.

702
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,460
The staff.

703
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
You should be careful.

704
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,460
I'll kneel down and bow to you.

705
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,460
Don't make me do that.

706
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,460
Be careful.

707
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,460
A sick cat,

708
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,860
a sick person.

709
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,860
Can we still play a game?

710
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,860
I won't.

711
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
You can go and bring Lu Yue home.

712
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,860
Okay.

713
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,860
Let's go.

714
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,860
I'm going to go home.

715
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,860
I'm going to go home.

716
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,860
I'm going to go home.

717
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,860
I'm going to go home.

718
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,860
I'm going to go home.

719
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,860
I'm going to go home.

720
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,860
I'm going to go home.

721
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,860
I'm going to go home.

722
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,860
I'm going to go home.

723
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,860
I'm going to go home.

724
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,860
I'm going to go home.

725
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,860
I'm going to go home.

726
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,860
I'm going to go home.

727
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,860
I'm going to go home.

728
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,260
I'm going to chase after the light.

729
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,260
I'm going to chase after the light.

730
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,260
If I keep chasing a dream,

731
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,260
I'm going to chase after the light.

732
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,260
So we're going to go back to the wall.

733
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,260
The darkness will still shine.

734
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,260
How much longer will we remember?

735
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,260
How much longer will we remember?

736
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,260
How much longer will we remember?

737
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,660
How much longer will we remember?

738
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,660
How much longer will we remember?

739
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,660
How much longer will we remember?

740
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,660
How much longer will we remember?

741
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,660
How much longer will we remember?

742
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,660
How much longer will we remember?

743
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,660
How much longer will we remember?

744
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,660
How much longer will we remember?

745
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,660
How much longer will we remember?

746
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,660
How much longer will we remember?

747
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,660
How much longer will we remember?

748
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,660
How much longer will we remember?

749
