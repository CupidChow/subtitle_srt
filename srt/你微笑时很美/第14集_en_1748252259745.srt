1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Why are you secretly crying here?

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,960
Because of the game?

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,960
It turns out that the game was almost very unhappy.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
I saw him in the ring and he was so sad.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
I thought he was going to tell me this.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,960
I really had no choice.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
I would be better if I had prepared next time.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,960
But I didn't have a chance.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
You already know that those people won the game.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,920
Why do you care so much?

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,920
Because you always said that I could be on the same team.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,920
This feeling is quite familiar.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,920
There is no other team that wins the game easily.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,960
It looks like someone who has done a lot of work before you

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
who knows how much work he has done.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
Everyone is human.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,960
How could someone be as strong as an alien?

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,960
So don't be too much.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
Don't be too much prepared.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Brother Cheng.

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,960
I want to ask A-Tai to play again.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Aren't you afraid?

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Brother Cheng.

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
I'll go to the bathroom.

25
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Didn't you just go there?

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm afraid.

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Tong Yao.

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Don't be stressed.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,960
We all know your efforts.

31
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I should be stressed now.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
It's okay, Tong Yao.

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
You can do it.

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
I'll handle Gao Cong's side.

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
It's obvious that he's so nervous.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Don't let him be stressed.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
You're really talking nonsense.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm not nervous.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Really.

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm not nervous at all.

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Really.

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,960
I'm not nervous at all.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:11,980
You're good at

44
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Come back.

45
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,980
The game is starting.

46
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Where's my mouse?

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
I don't see my mouse.

48
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,980
Where did it go?

49
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,980
Here.

50
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
Did you see it here?

51
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,980
It appeared again.

52
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,980
Why is your hand so cold?

53
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,980
I just used cold water to wash my hands.

54
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,980
You lost,

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
but you lost a game.

56
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,980
What are you nervous about?

57
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,980
You were so close to him

58
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,980
and you were so angry.

59
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,980
Are you An Weiren?

60
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,980
Close your eyes.

61
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,980
Take a deep breath.

62
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,980
Relax.

63
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
It's okay if you can't play.

64
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
I'll take you.

65
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
Did you hear that?

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,980
Brother Cheng said

67
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
if you can't play, I'll take you.

68
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,980
Like a normal person

69
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,980
who speaks to Miss.

70
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,980
I'm so moved after hearing it.

71
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Can you hear him

72
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
saying this

73
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,980
from his mouth?

74
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
The game is over.

75
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
You two are really bad at playing.

76
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,980
When you're in the exam,

77
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
you hold the captain's leg

78
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,980
and beg him to take you to win.

79
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,980
Why don't you say

80
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,980
he's not a normal person

81
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
and you're not a normal person?

82
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,980
You're not a normal person.

83
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,980
Why don't you say

84
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,980
he's not a normal person?

85
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,980
Let's start.

86
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,980
Tong Yao,

87
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,980
should we take the money

88
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
from the fish?

89
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
I'll take the money from the fish.

90
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Okay.

91
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
Okay.

92
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Go.

93
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,980
It's obvious that we're going to the bank.

94
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,980
Old He just helped you

95
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
to do a one-shot.

96
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Are you still locked up?

97
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,980
Did he even dare to lie down

98
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
and then he could

99
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
back off 300 cash

100
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
in 5 minutes?

101
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Did you fall down in the middle?

102
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
You're very strong today.

103
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
Stop talking.

104
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
The big snake is about to burn.

105
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
The economy of both sides

106
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980
is almost the same.

107
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
If we hit the big snake,

108
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,980
we should be able to break the gap.

109
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
Old He,

110
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,980
go and give them a demonstration.

111
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
Okay.

112
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Why are they

113
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
not hitting the big snake?

114
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,980
What are they doing here?

115
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Who are you scaring?

116
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
Wait for me.

117
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,980
Old He, he's coming.

118
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,980
You saw him.

119
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,980
You just kept walking.

120
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,980
You ran faster than the westerners.

121
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,980
I'll die if I don't run.

122
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
What do you mean?

123
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
Come on.

124
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,980
After we finish this big snake,

125
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
we'll just have a fight.

126
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,980
It's okay if we don't fight.

127
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
I'll fight for you

128
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
on your own.

129
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
Xiaofeng.

130
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,980
My support is still yours.

131
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,980
If you keep doing this,

132
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
will the wolf be able to protect you?

133
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
Wind,

134
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
double-clutch,

135
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
you really used the Bian'an Flower

136
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,980
to break the gap.

137
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
Go.

138
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Why are you hiding?

139
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
The jungle is going up.

140
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
You're not going to go up.

141
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
Come here.

142
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,980
What are you afraid of?

143
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Xiaofeng is gone.

144
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,980
It's not good to be in a state of retreat.

145
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Old He, come and support me.

146
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Don't be afraid.

147
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Hide behind and continue to go out.

148
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Go, go, go.

149
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,980
If you don't agree,

150
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
you can retreat.

151
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980
I'm not afraid.

152
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,980
You don't have to hide in the early morning.

153
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
Old He, you go back.

154
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Old He, wait.

155
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,980
Come here and take a class.

156
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,980
You can't.

157
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,980
No, no, no.

158
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,980
I'm not in control.

159
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
Xiaofeng,

160
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
you can't do this.

161
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
You can do it.

162
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,980
Take the girl and go to the army.

163
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Two classes.

164
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,980
I'll go back to the city first and wait for you to revive.

165
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,980
Just retreat.

166
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
Because of you,

167
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
don't be afraid.

168
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
I'll go back to the city first and wait for you to revive.

169
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I'll go back to the city first and wait for you to revive.

170
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
I'll go back to the city first and wait for you to revive.

171
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
Don't worry.

172
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
It's okay to lose.

173
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
Miss,

174
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,980
we can't fight here.

175
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Miss,

176
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
let's fight here.

177
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
Miss,

178
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,980
let's fight here.

179
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,980
Miss,

180
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
I'm afraid I will lose.

181
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
I'll die.

182
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,020
Yanran,

183
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,460
I don't know why,

184
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,900
since I haven't dealt with you.

185
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,760
Look out,

186
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Everyone is a human.

187
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
How could someone be as strong as a alien?

188
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Never be too emotional.

189
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
嘛!

190
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,260
That's my不是!

191
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,760
That's my grenades!

192
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Love in life

193
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,600
Pretty good

194
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,140
It like what you've thought

195
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,300
Right?

196
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,220
right

197
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,440
Ahem, i have a memory

198
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,280
You write not real

199
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,840
Okay.

200
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,240
Okay.

201
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,560
Good job.

202
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,520
You think a lot about your doing this during practice.

203
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

204
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,080
I'm looking forward under the

205
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,960
I'll play a good pc.

206
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,900
Actually, I was即

207
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,840
for the fact.

208
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,400
You are being modest.

209
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,280
What do you mean?

210
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
There are people who called me dearly.

211
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,020
categ warriors

212
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
Why do you treat me so rudely

213
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,360
when the reputation has涂

214
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
I'll work harder in the future.

215
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I'll try to kill her as soon as possible.

216
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
You're very rich.

217
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
But it's just a rich man in the scope of the scope of the scope.

218
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Today's training competition is a very sad one for Tong Yao.

219
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I'll tell you what, let's go eat something delicious together.

220
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Okay.

221
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Go get the menu.

222
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Yes, go get the menu.

223
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Yes, go get the menu.

224
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Okay.

225
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,360
If every professional player has to go through a dark period,

226
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,360
then from the moment I started the battle for the Aitai,

227
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,360
this experience has become part of my opening.

228
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,360
It makes me a very smart and professional player.

229
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
I'll never give up.

230
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,360
You have to win the game and try to be a new player.

231
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I'll go get the menu.

232
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Go for it.

233
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Go for it.

234
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Get up.

235
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
You're so noisy.

236
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm going to get you.

237
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Go for it.

238
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
But he's very strong.

239
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
He's too much.

240
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,360
As the captain, I'm very happy to have such a player.

241
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
With his participation,

242
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,360
ZGDX will become the top player this summer.

243
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
The match is just a match.

244
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Cheng's mouth is already drooping.

245
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
He's not that good.

246
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Cheng, you have to praise me.

247
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
I love you, Cheng.

248
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
I'm so bored.

249
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
I'll always support you.

250
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Cheng is such a man.

251
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
ZGDX will become the top player.

252
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
He's really smiling.

253
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
Rui.

254
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
What's wrong?

255
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Are you going to the toilet?

256
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Can't you hold it?

257
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
No, I can't.

258
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Rui, look at this.

259
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
What?

260
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
The netizen is with you.

261
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
But he's very strong.

262
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
He's too serious.

263
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
As the captain,

264
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm very happy to have such a player.

265
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
With his participation,

266
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
ZGDX will become the top player this summer.

267
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Give me the phone.

268
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm so tired of you.

269
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
This is not the previous interview.

270
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
It's been so long.

271
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Are you going to fight?

272
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
I'm watching the video with Rui.

273
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
You're praising me.

274
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
What's wrong with you?

275
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
The interview was written by the former staff.

276
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
It's just a misunderstanding.

277
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
I don't believe you, Rui.

278
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Is it?

279
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
It's a lie.

280
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
The note is just a question of interview.

281
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Who dares to ask Lu Si Cheng

282
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
how to answer this question?

283
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
Give me the phone.

284
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I won't.

285
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Give it back to me.

286
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
No, I won't.

287
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Give it back to me.

288
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
No.

289
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Taunting

290
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
What are you doing?

291
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Play some tricks for you.

292
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
What were you talking about?

293
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Shut up.

294
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,560
His Highness...

295
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,560
Forget it.

296
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,120
With such an doll,

297
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,560
you'd still be so strained.

298
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,800
But why don't you pressure Xiao Dong Wu?

299
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,160
A vlogger.

300
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,480
Who are these old-fashioned Xiao Dong Wu people?

301
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,200
Lu Yue,

302
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
who do you give your track records to?

303
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,800
Did he send it online?

304
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
How could it be possible?

305
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,920
I'm not that low-key.

306
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,640
You're even lower-key than you think.

307
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,320
When Wang Ruo was on the interview,

308
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,320
his eyes were still open.

309
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,120
Add someろl 吃点ろ 看饼

310
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,520
and eat 调 louder.

311
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,880
Don't stuff your mouth.

312
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,360
Oh ho!

313
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,760
if it's fried and it's done and there will be a cold-blooded death.

314
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,400
That's right!

315
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,160
Don't do it!

316
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,720
Don't eat anymore!

317
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,040
Eat on therophies.

318
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,520
I'll bring it back!

319
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,240
Okay!

320
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,880
Go ahead.

321
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,600
I cannot hold it any more.

322
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,440
Thank you.

323
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,640
Does it taste good or not?

324
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,720
a temporary father

325
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,240
Resignation

326
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,640
I asked you to take a bath

327
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
Hello I called sister-in-law

328
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Sister-in-law

329
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Correct

330
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,720
This one

331
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,680
You first

332
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,760
It's so funny

333
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,760
Everyone too

334
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,160
Brother

335
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,480
You justD Цing Hang

336
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:46,960
right

337
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,480
Who

338
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm your girlfriend.

339
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,080
Mrs. Lu.

340
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,640
I didn't mean to.

341
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,400
Shut up.

342
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,840
It's not that Mrs. Lu.

343
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,840
Hello?

344
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,480
What are you doing?

345
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
You've called so many times.

346
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,080
You didn't answer.

347
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
What's the matter?

348
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
Be careful.

349
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,680
What's the hurry?

350
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,680
You don't even know the time.

351
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,680
And you're at the meeting.

352
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Why did you come out?

353
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,680
Your company is closing down.

354
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,480
Why are you so cold?

355
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
The weather is clear.

356
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,480
This kind of garden is not a garden.

357
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,880
It's a planted rain.

358
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
It's a girlfriend's mistake.

359
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm leaving.

360
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,280
Why are you praising her?

361
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
She's better than me.

362
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm praising her.

363
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,680
I'm going to the washroom.

364
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
You guys eat first.

365
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:48,880
Go in.

366
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Go in.

367
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,080
Brother Cheng.

368
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,080
What's up?

369
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,920
I don't know who will find you

370
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,280
as Mrs. Lu.

371
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
But I'm a bit very honest now.

372
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,760
Are you jealous?

373
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,000
Don't be crazy.

374
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,760
You don't deserve it.

375
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,040
Okay.

376
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,280
It must be good.

377
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,680
What?

378
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,520
You're here for Shenzhen?

379
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,560
Why are you here?

380
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm starting the contest.

381
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,360
I don't have time to play with you.

382
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,280
Play?

383
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,840
Didn't Luo Yue tell you?

384
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,720
When did Luo Yue tell me?

385
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,600
If you want to see him,

386
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,240
if you want him to go back,

387
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,560
you can contact him yourself.

388
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,080
Don't leave the house

389
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,320
and come to the fire, okay?

390
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,520
Are you okay?

391
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,600
I'm fine.

392
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,680
Okay.

393
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,200
I see.

394
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,800
I'll do the test.

395
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,680
What do you want to eat?

396
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,200
Will you do it?

397
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,120
Of course.

398
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,880
Okay, let's go.

399
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,600
Let him eat.

400
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,480
I'll leave it to you.

401
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,440
Okay.

402
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,080
You're so happy after cutting it.

403
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,040
Go, go, go.

404
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,640
Shake hands.

405
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,560
Good.

406
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:29,720
Okay.

407
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,400
Have some.

408
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Thank you.

409
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Why don't you eat?

410
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,200
I'm fat after eating.

411
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,520
It's delicious.

412
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,600
Okay.

413
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,400
Luo Yue,

414
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,800
if you want to make trouble,

415
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
if you can't understand

416
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,280
because of this,

417
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,760
you'll never understand

418
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,680
a girl

419
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
who doesn't even have a son.

420
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,440
A girl in her mid-year.

421
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
But one day,

422
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,480
she finally had a hope.

423
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,600
And this hope is very soon to be broken.

424
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,280
That's really late.

425
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,400
Hello.

426
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,360
Brother, I'm looking for you.

427
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,920
A blind date?

428
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
What blind date?

429
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,240
Don't you think it's a bit crazy?

430
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,280
I have a training session

431
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,640
every day in the afternoon.

432
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
How can I have a blind date?

433
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,960
You look pretty.

434
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,040
You're a regular.

435
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,640
What's the point of being a regular?

436
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,560
You don't want me to play the training session,

437
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,600
you don't want me to play the game,

438
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,040
you don't want me to play the blind date online.

439
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,480
You don't want to see each girl

440
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,560
on every big and small festival.

441
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,040
It's as quiet as she is.

442
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,880
Is that so?

443
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,240
If that's the case, I'll accept it.

444
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
Brother Cheng.

445
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,760
I like

446
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,160
the rules of the game.

447
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,480
I haven't understood the game yet.

448
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,680
I think about dating every day.

449
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,000
What's wrong with that?

450
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,600
This is not good.

451
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,640
If the electronic bug is hungry,

452
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,720
it will still be a bit serious.

453
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,360
I'm a straight man.

454
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
It's not good.

455
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,160
Don't worry about my new hometown.

456
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,600
I like women who are straight and scary.

457
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,360
Why do you...

458
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,240
Why don't you just

459
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
get along with that girl?

460
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
I don't know.

461
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,240
It's okay.

462
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,640
I'll handle the matter of Wang.

463
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,080
Hello, mom.

464
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,560
It's me.

465
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,200
Mom, don't be blind.

466
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,640
A high-ranking like my brother

467
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,960
can easily get a pair of girls

468
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,800
in a single date.

469
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,720
You don't need to be close to her.

470
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,680
Today's game is very important to our team.

471
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,920
We're very busy today.

472
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,520
And we'll see

473
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
if we can win the championship.

474
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,840
You're right.

475
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,680
My brother is in the blind date.

476
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,760
I'll help you talk to him.

477
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,700
When Iiku came from Jiang Happy

478
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,520
he never asked me whether you're feeling sick.

479
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
What did he tell mom?

480
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,860
When Iiku responsible for it,

481
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,680
he told me a few of his parents

482
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,200
refused to be mercigiful.

483
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm so worried.

484
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,960
I even feel no obligation

485
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,920
to tell my mom

486
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,360
to die at our wedding

487
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,960
and punish the victims of our own family.

488
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,400
You're hard on us,

489
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm super worried.

490
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
I'm not going to buy you a new one.

491
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Brother, don't look at me like that.

492
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm not going to buy you a new one anyway.

493
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Brother, don't be angry.

494
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Hello, mom.

495
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Come on, you eat this. He won't be angry.

496
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,400
So your brother really wants to go to the blind date?

497
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
The blind date is just a process.

498
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
The queen is determined.

499
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
She can't say anything.

500
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,400
But if the other party is really a sensible and beautiful

501
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
If the relationship is always better than her

502
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
It's like a robot.

503
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Maybe people can be more harmonious.

504
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,400
When you went to the blind date, the phone hung faster than anyone.

505
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
I'm different.

506
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I have a friend who is very quiet.

507
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
This is my girlfriend.

508
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Girlfriend?

509
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
I can't even put up with the face of the goddess.

510
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
It's hard.

511
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
It's better to do more professional notes when you have time to fight.

512
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
The next game is not easy.

513
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
The blue team is the traditional good door of the old brand.

514
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Although the new year is not good,

515
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
There is no way to score a treasure game.

516
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,400
The top-ranking ranking in the game has always been more difficult.

517
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,400
In theory, he is the only team in this team that can teach us.

518
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
The strength is not small.

519
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
You should know it very well.

520
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I remember last training game

521
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
The old cat was caught by the other person.

522
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Finally, the middle and the back are stable.

523
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,400
The second team is strong and have a good advantage.

524
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
The final game is successful.

525
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Only then can you win.

526
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
So you still have to do your homework first.

527
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Do you hear me?

528
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Do your homework well.

529
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Dad,

530
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Can you not be in my mind in the future?

531
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Just introduce me to anyone.

532
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I really don't have time now.

533
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
I don't need to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

534
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
We have fought with them several times.

535
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,400
I believe in their strength and spirit.

536
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

537
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

538
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

539
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

540
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

541
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

542
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

543
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

544
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I think it's a good idea to introduce the situation of the Fnatic team.

545
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,400
a small big boy

546
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Nice

547
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
If they were divided into red rooms,

548
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,040
Kun will basically take the target with him.

549
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,360
If the target of the target

550
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,960
sees the target's movement,

551
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,720
he will start to counterattack

552
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,000
or enter the jungle.

553
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,040
The attack rate is very high.

554
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,920
Look, here, here, here.

555
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,440
They are all counterattacked.

556
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,200
Xiang Xiang Fan,

557
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,840
if he doesn't let him take the target

558
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,440
and take the target's river path,

559
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,160
his rhythm is not that good.

560
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,840
Look.

561
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,200
The match between the CK team

562
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,600
and the previous loss of the rhythm,

563
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,360
the jungle will be destroyed.

564
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,000
What's going on?

565
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,920
God Ming,

566
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,840
the combination of the two is really effective.

567
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,200
It's a big deal.

568
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,320
Come on, have another bite.

569
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,680
How come I feel that

570
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,640
the team is so strange

571
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,480
and have a data analysis room?

572
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,720
I think it's good.

573
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,320
Don't you need to pay more?

574
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
If you all want to be like Tong Yao,

575
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I'll burn the incense.

576
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,160
The lazy will grow slowly in the future.

577
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,000
Not only that, go.

578
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,160
It's delicious and satisfying.

579
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,000
Go.

580
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,520
Look,

581
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,800
when Lu Yue came,

582
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,960
it was also very satisfying.

583
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,760
But now,

584
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,880
he's just a person

585
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,640
who knows how to

586
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,360
give others the bottle of the bottle.

587
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,960
Shut up, fat man.

588
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
I'm late.

589
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
See you there later.

590
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,400
Lu Yue, where's my car key?

591
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,960
I don't know.

592
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,400
Here's where it is.

593
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,880
Here.

594
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,640
Thanks, Sir.

595
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:14,360
Tong Yao,

596
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,000
pay attention to this.

597
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,440
Can I have one of these bags?

598
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,440
I'll keep your money

599
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,520
as a gift to get you a new concerten's concerto.

600
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Okay.

601
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,080
It's so pretty.

602
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Yes.

603
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,320
Your hug is going to break your heart.

604
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,280
He really invited me

605
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,160
during this trip.

606
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,000
It's too late now.

607
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,880
I saved it for the beginning.

608
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,080
So sexy.

609
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,800
This is Secondly,

610
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,040
Wait for ten minutes.

611
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,100
Okay.

612
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,480
I'll put it in AXin's mind.

613
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,140
It can't be named.

614
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,120
Everyone,

615
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,700
be Tempered and beyond.

616
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,460
Then...

617
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,580
It's okay.

618
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,920
Will this pile of salt

619
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,760
actually help to drink too much water?

620
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,420
Is it okay?

621
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,620
Is not it okay?

622
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,360
Then

623
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,480
Don't make notes.

624
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,400
We apologize.

625
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,040
Your intégration of photos

626
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,520
is very good.

627
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,280
Don't drive.

628
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,000
As

629
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Miss Su.

630
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:56,760
Heading to the hotel conclusion

631
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,820
Hello, I'm Su Luo

632
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,760
Lu Si Chen

633
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,600
Someone sent me to send you home

634
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,080
Taking you here to LINC?

635
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,760
No more meeting

636
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,000
OK

637
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,160
Wait for me here

638
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,480
I'm in the bathroom

639
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,520
Please

640
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,080
I'll go to the bathroom.

641
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Please.

642
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,000
Hello,

643
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
Baby.

644
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,000
How is it going today?

645
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,160
Is the bride going well?

646
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh my god.

647
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,800
You said you found these beauties.

648
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,640
You're too irresponsible.

649
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,320
Are you not satisfied?

650
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,160
We've seen each other before.

651
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
No.

652
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm more handsome.

653
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,120
I didn't have any hopes.

654
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,480
I didn't have any plans.

655
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,640
My daughter is born with a strong will.

656
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,480
What else do I need?

657
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,240
Anyway, I'm very satisfied with this person.

658
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,760
Okay, they're waiting for me outside.

659
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,560
I won't tell you first.

660
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,320
Let's talk at home.

661
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Bye.

662
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Okay.

663
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,240
Gr Kamanda

664
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,600
Kiss again.

665
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,960
I just kissed you.

666
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,920
But you look good.

667
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,040
I didn't look clean.

668
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,560
Where are you?

669
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,800
Jianой Team will ΕYEE Team.

670
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,400
Toเ��尾 Team will Montana Team.

671
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,120
We have generous people in all teams.

672
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,880
To投 you, we have to sell you the wind picking.

673
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,440
To be honest, I didn't think once you asked the company to cancelledле

674
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,160
Okay.

675
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,680
Wait here.

676
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,160
15 minutes.

677
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,200
The stomach is not good.

678
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,520
You men really don't understand anything.

679
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm going to make up for it.

680
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,240
It's not convenient.

681
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,600
Fu Yun.

682
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,320
Hello.

683
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,880
Buy it.

684
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,320
Here.

685
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,880
Please.

686
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,440
Here.

687
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,000
Let's go.

688
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
I heard you are a professional computer player.

689
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,840
Yes.

690
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,080
I thought it was different.

691
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,880
I thought the computer player was a young man.

692
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,080
I didn't expect you to be like this.

693
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,880
What's wrong with me?

694
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
I think it's not bad now.

695
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,040
What do you think?

696
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,760
What do you think?

697
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,240
The computer is really good.

698
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
You are the first time to want to pay?

699
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,440
You are not?

700
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,960
Where are we going now?

701
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,520
Do you want to eat that?

702
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,920
I can't eat these.

703
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,280
It looks greasy.

704
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,680
And it's not too...

705
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,120
raw.

706
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:26,960
Hello.

707
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,680
I want a big piece of it.

708
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,640
Add more fish slices.

709
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,440
Add more sea urchin.

710
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,240
Big bag.

711
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,880
Okay.

712
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,840
So handsome.

713
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,880
You are so handsome.

714
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,600
Thank you.

715
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,320
You like this kind of food?

716
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,560
I'll give you a pet food.

717
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,880
A pet food?

718
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,080
Is it a dog?

719
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,480
But it's not bad.

720
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,600
It's rabbit.

721
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,920
Rabbit?

722
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,760
Can a rabbit eat such greasy food?

723
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,880
It's a trash can.

724
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,680
Eat anything.

725
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,680
Thank you.

726
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,360
How can you say that?

727
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,840
You are so mean.

728
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,680
You don't even give me a backpack.

729
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,320
Wait for me here.

730
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,360
I'll go to the show.

731
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I want to do this next time.

732
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,240
I don't want it.

733
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
I want to be a man in this car.

734
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,040
What a coincidence.

735
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,800
We have such a big family.

736
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,400
We can't sit down

737
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,760
and talk to you.

738
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,160
Do you have time this weekend?

739
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,720
We can...

740
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,160
I want to play a game this weekend.

741
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,520
I'll go to see you play a game.

742
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,160
I haven't seen the game before.

743
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
If I'm your friend,

744
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,960
can I...

745
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,920
Sit down.

746
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,600
You are good.

747
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,160
You are good too.

748
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,040
I'm not good.

749
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,160
I'm not good.

750
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,200
But I think we are not suitable.

751
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,600
It's so cold and hard to play.

752
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,720
How about this?

753
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,080
Tell me where your home is.

754
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,120
I'll send you back.

755

Okay.

756
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,280
Tong Yao.

757
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,520
You have watched this video three times, right?

758
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,720
I'll watch the drama again.

759
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,480
It's raining so hard.

760
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
I don't know if Chen Guo is dead.

761
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,680
My brother hasn't come back yet.

762
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,120
It means he's in a blind date.

763
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
Let's go.

770
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,840
What are you doing?

771
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,360
Do you want to play a game?

772
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,080
I'm tired.

773
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,960
Go and play.

774
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,000
What's wrong with him?

775
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,920
Guess.

776
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,880

I'm going to go.

792
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,720
I'm going to go.

793
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,680
I'm going to go.

794
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,720
I'm going to go.

795
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,760
