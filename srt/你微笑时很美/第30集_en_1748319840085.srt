1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
The champion

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,200
I didn't expect that

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
our team

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,360
can enter the market with a lot of luck

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,560
I think

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,080
it must be Miss Smiling

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,320
who prays for me

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Miss Smiling

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,200
Let's meet at the finals together

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,880
S.T.S.

11
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,680
Episode 16

12
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,760
So beautiful

13
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,680
Come, look so迷

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,080
Come, Fatty

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,780
come on

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,300
Mo

17
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,520
Okay

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,900
Come

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,040
Lu Yue

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,600
Come on, Houcheng

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,240
Hot book

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you looking at?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Before, YQC won the fan take

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and won the national championship.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The next team's boss was standing at the door

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and got a big red envelope.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes, they got the red envelope one by one.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The red envelope was thick.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And we...

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And we...

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We didn't win.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why?

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We also entered the championship.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why did the next team get the red envelope?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We only have the candy and the card.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We don't even have a delicious one.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't think it's fair.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think I've said it wrong.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The second exam in the exam is

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the rare candy in the exam.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And we've been in the competition.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And the rare candy in the exam.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We've entered the national championship

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and got the standard.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So what's the reward?

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
A candy.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Brother Cheng, what's that?

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have something to tell you.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong?

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Lu Si Cheng, you don't have a heart.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
LMei, what's that?

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
An jeweller toows.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's preservation of the candy inside the giant box.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't only liar afraid of fat people,

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
you often wearκεLings.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Take a look.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Xiao Ben has some negotiations with you.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Then we should go scout the shop.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The shop is under the ат.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The store isibite event.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
You have to dry your skin until it's dry.

62
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
This little face mask

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,840
has a good water effect.

64
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,200
I won't get water either.

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
So many.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,760
Good.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,000
Little face mask.

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,240
Do you want to try it?

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,280
Is it good?

70
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,320
You were shouting at me at that time.

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,640
Old cat's reverse fox

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,000
can make the earth three-circle.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,920
Shut up.

74
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,440
Everyone.

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,480
After today's game,

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,240
we will welcome the final.

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,040
But I still want to remind everyone

78
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
that YQCB is no longer a former team.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
He defeated Fnatic

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,280
and joined the final with us.

81
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,400
The rules are right.

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,160
Don't talk nonsense.

83
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,520
Before the final starts,

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
we have to do the whole base

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
to train the seal.

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
How to train the seal?

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Isn't it going to

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,040
completely bully us?

89
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,200
The exact degree of the seal

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,920
is to prevent the opponent from being like a guard.

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,720
For example,

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
we can't be with the boss of the white rich girl next door.

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,560
We can't have a chat with the boss.

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,960
We can't have a chat with the former team

95
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,240
and the current team.

96
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
We can discuss the strategy

97
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,200
after we finish the game.

98
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Of course,

99
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,120
we have to be close to the big soldiers.

100
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,400
We can't be with the cats in the middle.

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Wait.

102
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,040
Can we draw a map on the cat?

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
Why don't you just

104
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,760
build a water-stained wall

105
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,640
and guard the room?

106
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,720
Guard the wall?

107
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,080
Why don't you guard the door

108
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
in the middle of the room?

109
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,600
Why?

110
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,280
How can we get out

111
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,640
from the door of the house?

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,080
Xiaoyu,

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,720
I'll put my head on the list.

114
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,960
How about we

115
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,080
find a way to make it a little more complicated?

116
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,280
No, no.

117
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,240
I can do it.

118
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,280
Anyway, my brother won't let me

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,040
get the middle list.

120
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,040
Fu Yi.

121
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,680
Shut up.

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,040
Shut up.

123
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,840
Let's go.

124
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,360
Before we officially enter the seal training room,

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
I'll treat you to a big meal.

126
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,880
Okay.

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,600
Yes.

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,880
I'll come in with this.

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,120
Let's go, Xiao Ming.

130
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,000
I know.

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,280
Don't shout at me like that.

132
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,840
Let's go.

133
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Let's go.

134
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,800
Come on.

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,840
Come on.

136
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,560
Come on.

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,480
Isn't that a DQ-5?

138
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,600
What's wrong with them?

139
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
Did they need to be banned?

140
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,680
They are about to be banned.

141
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,640
When you were in the Eight Walls competition,

142
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,000
they were still playing the game.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,960
No one paid attention to them,

144
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,000
so there was no question.

145
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
They have lost the game.

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
They are about to be banned.

147
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
They are playing the game of the game.

148
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,840
The next game is in the OPL 12 team.

149
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,960
There is no DQ-5.

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,680
He is Lin Meng.

151
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,640
I know.

152
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,160
He is the assistant of the DQ-5 team.

153
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,800
He is an old player.

154
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,000
You have to be careful.

155
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Don't make trouble for me.

156
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,720
This year,

157
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,680
don't make trouble this year.

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,720
Fight well in the national finals.

159
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,000
After you get the World Cup,

160
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,080
you should be proud of the world

161
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,560
and compete for the OPL.

162
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,560
Brothers,

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,560
I can't be like last year

164
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
to you.

165
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,320
I really like to play the game.

166
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,920
I like to feel like

167
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,360
fighting with my teammates.

168
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,480
I have a lot of regrets.

169
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,120
But I am still happy.

170
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,080
Now my path is the end.

171
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,600
But I know

172
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,600
someone will continue to go.

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
And go even further.

174
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I hope you are lucky.

175
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,080
Let's go.

176
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,400
I will give them a ride.

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
Drink slowly.

178
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,640
Bye.

179
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,880
Bye.

180
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,840
You should go home soon.

181
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,640
재,

182
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
my document is in it.

183
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
Porridge is obtained.

184
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,160
Hey,

185
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,440
ben.

186
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,120
Because it's born in the terminal of a peròmen vulnerably sick food,

187
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,920
My fans have really Zapung.

188
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,520
It's like I asked the waterー

189
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,480
teaxa heartperryzuoshou handicraft.

190
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,560
It's so hard.

191
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,800
Distribute the food.

192
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
You want to demolish all of it?

193
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,400
We are a team,

194
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,020
but yet we use jinnong for nogle to destroy eggs.

195
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,140
It's impossible.

196
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,860
in the regional games.

197
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,300
That's a reality.

198
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,900
They'll do no harm

199
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,160
to the new team

200
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,220
after the game ends,

201
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,940
and keep returning to

202
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,820
OPL

203
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,780
for other teams.

204
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,720
They can only find

205
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,140
your own strategies

206
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,940
and fall into Xiwei.

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,700
That's a seriously

208
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,740
spicier game.

209
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,020
Yeah.

210
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,260
And it looks like

211
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,140
they have changed

212
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,260
their mind

213
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,140
to 들어�il that bad.

214
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,620
They don't even

215
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,440
say a word of welcome to me.

216
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,580
So

217
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,420
to bottom dreamers like Em� and F with DK5,

218
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,600
they're

219
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,360
The moment we failed in the season,

220
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,960
we announced the end of the season.

221
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
Can we still be like the past?

222
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
We can play the game together.

223
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
We can't be far away

224
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,280
from eating and drinking.

225
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,400
So,

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,120
it's a good time to cherish the time.

227
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,440
I'm so happy.

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,280
Our team was almost finished with the meal.

229
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,720
I don't want to eat the meal.

230
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
But the potato, beef, and curry you made

231
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
can be a bowl of rice.

232
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
I want to eat it, too.

233
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,280
I want to eat it, too.

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,280
I want to eat it, too.

235
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,040
I want to eat it, too.

236
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
I want to eat it, too.

237
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
And it's the kind of meat that's hidden under the bowl.

238
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,120
Okay.

239
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
After we finish the game,

240
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
I will satisfy your requirements.

241
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
Let's toast first.

242
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,720
Come on.

243
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,760
Cheers.

244
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,520
The spirit of the body is the best.

245
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,920
Cheers.

246
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Cheers.

247
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,600
I have a telling.

248
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,720
A ten out of ten deciditions are becoming over.

249
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,600
I'll give the young man the money.

250
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,480
It's for you.

251
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,520
The young man's younger brother,

252
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,360
him.

253
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,400
You're just letting him give up one day

254
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,880
and not making money.

255
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,720
Still,

256
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,760
Well.

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,520
Don't be like this.

258
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
or your lovely fans?

259
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Goodbye.

260
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
DQ Firefighter,

261
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
you have the glory of glory.

262
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Where are you going?

263
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
The training is not scary.

264
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
We'll be with you.

265
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Cat Chen,

266
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,720
can we see the Spring Festival again?

267
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
We'll be happy to see you.

268
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I don't know what to do after the loss.

269
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
I've never liked a team like this.

270
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I'll never watch the OPL again.

271
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
I'm so tired.

272
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Why do I like the scene?

273
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Sometimes, I always advise myself

274
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
to like the Korean TAT team,

275
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
or the ZGDX team.

276
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
That's great.

277
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
They can win the game.

278
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm so happy to see their fans.

279
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
I've said it many times,

280
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
but I still came here to see your game.

281
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Fans are so disappointed.

282
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
But I'm optimistic.

283
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
I think you'll be even more disappointed next time.

284
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
What should I do?

285
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
I'm disappointed, too.

286
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
I can't get away from it.

287
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm not here to watch the wind.

288
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm not here to be angry.

289
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I'm not here to be angry.

290
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I'm not here to be angry.

291
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm not here to be angry.

292
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
I'm not here to be angry.

293
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm not here to be angry.

294
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
I'm not here to be angry.

295
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
I'm not here to be angry.

296
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Brother Cheng,

297
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
guess what I'm thinking.

298
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
What?

299
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
When I first saw you,

300
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
I was also so happy.

301
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
I could only watch you from afar.

302
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
But now,

303
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
I'm able to stand with you.

304
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
You're right.

305
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
But it's cute.

306
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I like it.

307
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Are these all made by fans?

308
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
It's so delicious.

309
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
You should try it.

310
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Relax.

311
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Since we're here,

312
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
it means we have this power.

313
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Don't be so nervous.

314
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I'll put it on for you

315
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
in Shanghai.

316
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Have a good time.

317
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
What?

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
You're here to play in Hong Li You City.

319
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
You're here to play in the park.

320
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
You're here.

321
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Go and play.

322
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Yes.

323
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
If you come home,

324
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
they'll ask you

325
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
what delicious food you eat in Shanghai.

326
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
You're so generous.

327
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
You're playing in the hotel.

328
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
I'm so embarrassed.

329
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Yes.

330
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Where do you want to go?

331
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
I can go anywhere.

332
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Where do you want to go?

333
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Guang Jie.

334
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
But I don't have anything to buy.

335
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
You're the only one who can

336
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
take care of the money.

337
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
You told me about it.

338
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Do you think I'm looking at your money?

339
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Do you think I'm looking at my money?

340
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Okay, brother.

341
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
What's your problem?

342
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
You want to spend money on me?

343
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I like someone

344
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
who wants to spend money on him.

345
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
I have ten yuan, nine yuan,

346
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
and I have a lot of money left.

347
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
I'm afraid he'll be hungry.

348
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Forget it.

349
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Forget it.

350
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,720
I've been a couple for two or three years.

351
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
I've made countless people

352
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
to pay for it.

353
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
I'm not a big deal.

354
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Just take my new

355
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
DW watch

356
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
and take it off for me.

357
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Look at this.

358
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
It's a big, elegant,

359
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
and it suits my temperament.

360
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
It doesn't suit you.

361
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Is this all you want?

362
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
You don't want to eat it?

363
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
I'll eat it all if you don't want to eat it.

364
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Eat it.

365
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Don't talk bad.

366
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Fatty, you're so cheerful.

367
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Hello, Jingyang.

368
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Are we going to

369
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
go on a trip to Shanghai?

370
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
What's wrong?

371
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Aren't you going to celebrate your birthday today?

372
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
What are you going to do?

373
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
This is the first time

374
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
we haven't been together

375
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
for a while.

376
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I think it's worth celebrating.

377
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
What's the present for you?

378
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
It's a letter.

379
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
A necklace.

380
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
A bracelet.

381
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
A wedding dress.

382
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Forget it.

383
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I'll let you send it to your man

384
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
if you want to wear a wedding dress.

385
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Forget it.

386
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
He has more money than me.

387
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
He can spend

388
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
his birthday

389
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
on your birthday.

390
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
He can buy the Dongfang Pearl.

391
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
He can call

392
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
my wife to celebrate his birthday.

393
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
You must not tell him

394
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
that it's my birthday today.

395
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
If he really buys it,

396
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
I'll be able to pay back

397
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
the money

398
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
I spent on the wedding dress.

399
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
You're so happy.

400
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
It's not like before.

401
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
I also want to send a boyfriend

402
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
a gift

403
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
that I can't even pay back

404
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
to my brother.

405
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
What's wrong with you today?

406
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Why do you always

407
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
do this for my birthday?

408
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Isn't this your beloved mother?

409
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
She called me just now.

410
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
She told me that

411
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
it's your first time

412
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
to celebrate your birthday

413
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
and ask me to spend it with you.

414
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Is she my mother or yours?

415
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Don't you

416
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
tell me about this directly?

417
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
She's embarrassed to tell you.

418
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
What?

419
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Yang Yang,

420
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm telling you,

421
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
I know that

422
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
your young people

423
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
are full of romance.

424
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Especially Dongyang.

425
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,720
He has a boyfriend now.

426
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
His boyfriend is quite good.

427
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
He's handsome and cultured.

428
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
So he can't do it.

429
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I just want to ask you

430
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
to remind Dongyang more.

431
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Be careful, girls.

432
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
You must take care

433
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
of your safety.

434
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Let me translate it for you.

435
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Your mom and I are still young.

436
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
We don't want to be apart for a while.

437
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Okay, okay.

438
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I'll hang up now.

439
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
What's wrong?

440
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Your face is so red.

441
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
My mom praised you for being pretty.

442
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Oh, no.

443
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
No way.

444
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I ate all of them

445
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
by myself.

446
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I didn't even

447
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
get a crab stick.

448
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
That's all.

449
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
It's not enough for you to eat three bowls of rice.

450
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Yes.

451
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
But this crab stick

452
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
is really delicious.

453
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Are you okay?

454
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
No, no.

455
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
You're not eating anymore?

456
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
I'm not eating anymore.

457
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Let's go back and see him.

458
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Are you okay?

459
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Brother Cheng, I have something to do.

460
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Zheng Qing.

461
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Doctor, is he okay?

462
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
No big deal.

463
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
He's in a good mood.

464
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
He's not in a good mood.

465
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
He's still a little feverish.

466
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
You can rest assured.

467
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
He's young.

468
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
He's in a good mood.

469
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Uncle,

470
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
you can go out tomorrow.

471
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Thank you.

472
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Then, Xiao Pang.

473
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Xiao Pang, how are you?

474
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm much better.

475
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
You guys.

476
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
You guys just make fun of me.

477
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Every time we go to an important game,

478
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
you guys make some tricks.

479
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
You guys don't move.

480
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Do you think I'm normal?

481
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I'll play the game tomorrow.

482
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
You're a little cool.

483
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
I'm hungry.

484
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
I want to eat biscuits.

485
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Say it again.

486
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
I've finished the ones I drew.

487
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I just developed it.

488
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
I'm not sick.

489
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
I'm hungry.

490
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
You guys can only take the same medicine

491
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
with you guys

492
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
to eat biscuits.

493
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I'm just afraid of you.

494
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
I'll eat biscuits, okay?

495
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
I can't eat biscuits.

496
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
I'll buy biscuits for you.

497
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Miss,

498
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Miss,

499
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
please buy some biscuits for me.

500
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Hurry up.

501
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I don't want to go to the hospital.

502
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
You have to help me.

503
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Think about

504
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
how miserable you were

505
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
when you were helping me.

506
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
What do you want to say?

507
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
How about buying biscuits for Xiao Pang?

508
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
She's sick like this.

509
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
I feel bad.

510
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
What are you doing?

511
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I didn't bring my wallet.

512
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
I don't have a phone.

513
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
I bought biscuits

514
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
and I can't even brush my teeth.

515
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Wait.

516
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I'll be back soon.

517
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Don't be mad at me.

518
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
I'm sick again.

519
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Hello.

520
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
How much is it?

521
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Hello.

522
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Chinese TV Series Exclusive YouTube

523
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
What are you going to do for your birthday?

524
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Do you want to hang out with me?

525
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
But

526
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I'm still in the hospital now.

527
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
I'll be on the line of birth.

528
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Happy birthday.

529
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,120
So happy!

530
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,580
Dead-pink, mom.

531
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,400
Let's have a meal.

532
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Happy birthday to you.

533
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Happy birthday to you.

534
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Happy birthday to you.

535
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Happy birthday to you.

536
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Happy birthday to you.

537
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Happy birthday to you.

538
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Happy birthday to you.

539
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Happy birthday to you.

540
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Happy birthday to you.

541
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Happy birthday to you.

542
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Happy birthday to you.

543
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
How did you know?

544
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
When I took your wallet,

545
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
I wanted to see your ID card.

546
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
You...

547
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Luckily, I was running fast.

548
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Otherwise, I would have closed the door.

549
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Happy birthday, you two.

550
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Can't you two be happy?

551
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Are you two not happy enough?

552
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
We are really hungry.

553
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Can you eat cake?

554
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Actually, I don't plan to celebrate my birthday.

555
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
It's about time to have a competition.

556
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Even if you want to have a competition,

557
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
you have to celebrate your birthday.

558
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Yes.

559
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Hurry up.

560
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Make a wish.

561
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Yes.

562
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Make a wish.

563
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Why you come arrived?

564
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Oh, not bad.

565
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Have a good night.

566
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Mr. Wei.

567
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
My friend bought tarot paper

568
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,720
to get you married yesterday.

569
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Is it good?

570
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Yes.

571
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
YourDesign is as good as everything,

572
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
when you are in the wedding area.

573
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Wait.

574
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Don't you have too much concern for me?

575
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
No way.

576
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,720
The host can surely help a couple tonight.

577
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,560
In the competition,

578
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,440
as a big manager,

579
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,080
I care about you all.

580
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,400
I can't help you

581
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,440
to get promoted in the competition,

582
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,200
but I can do a good job.

583
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,280
So,

584
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,240
to ensure your success,

585
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,520
all the bad lucks and bad lucks

586
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,880
are far from you.

587
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,840
I specially

588
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,720
ask for your help.

589
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,720
This!

590
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,680
A person who can do the laundry,

591
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
wash the dishes,

592
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,000
and live in a room

593
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,440
that is 360 degrees.

594
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,640
Come on, one by one.

595
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm sure you will

596
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,800
be a great talent in the finals.

597
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,520
Come on.

598
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,040
Well.

599
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,240
OK.

600
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,840
I'll let it go.

601
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,400
What do you have?

602
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,440
Think about it.

603
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,760
You were injured

604
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,880
and were ill

605
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,600
when you were on your way.

606
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
You have the power

607
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,720
to obtain it,

608
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,420
withoutness,

609
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,280
but you should be a不了 nurse,

610
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,200
and purchase lots of possibilities!

611
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,520
Your body is under easy andssaire,

612
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,240
right?

613
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,840
By the way,

614
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,880
this isn't Albion Department's

615
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,600
せのち気を丢し,

616
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,720
but my charm.

617
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,480
To regret

618
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,400
yourということ,

619
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,600
you have to go to the competition.

620
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,360
Or else, I would supervise.

621
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,720
Almighty bitch.

622
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,920
Even if it's a bus, you have to follow us, right?

623
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,320
Yes.

624
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,920
But to tell you the truth,

625
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,620
no matter what the result is, I will always support you.

626
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,820
No matter what happens, I will be the one to sell it.

627
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,420
Okay, give me one. I want to get one too.

628
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,820
I saw those netizens saying that this is pretty cool.

629
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,320
Really?

630
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,620
I will help you achieve whatever you want.

631
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,820
Brother Cheng, I also have a wish.

632
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,520
I have a wish.

633
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,920
Is it useful?

634
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,720
I said C. You two are not that good.

635
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,920
Although I let everyone relax, you are not like that either.

636
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,420
Our main goal now is to win the national championship.

637
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,420
The two of you are still on the road. Please make a little bit of money.

638
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,120
Really. I really don't want to be a bus driver.

639
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,620
My wish is to defeat YQCB and win the national championship and go to the world.

640
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,220
Yes.

641
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,720
It's gone.

642
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
To celebrate, let's go eat some meat.

643
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Good idea.

644
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,920
You are still eating?

645
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,120
The next one is not only the national championship,

646
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,920
but also the final match of the national championship.

647
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,520
You will train well after you are discharged from the hospital.

648
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,320
After training, please eat some crab noodles.

649
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,320
If you can't train, you can't even drink tea.

650
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,520
That's okay.

651
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,120
You two are sweet and early.

652
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
You two are quite close.

653
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,120
This is called a heart-to-heart relationship.

654
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,720
God Ming, what wish did you make?

655
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,920
What else can it be? It must be that we are the best at winning YQCB.

656
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,320
And there is a saying that CJDX will not disappear on the match.

657
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,520
Brother, why are you so impulsive again?

658
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,420
God Ming, you also believe in this.

659
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,120
Sometimes, people really need some luck.

660
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,720
You have already proved that you are the world's top professional player.

661
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,920
The rest is just like Xiaorui said. We still need a little bit of luck.

662
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,120
As long as we are together, all our wishes will come true.

663
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,320
Yes.

664
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Come.

665
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,120
Go, CJDX!

666
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,320
This person likes to hide here.

667
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,920
So when we fight, we must be careful.

668
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,520
And I watched all these videos of the same demon.

669
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Jiao Huang is back.

670
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
Jiao Huang, why did you wear so many clothes today?

671
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Is it because of his inner tension?

672
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,720
So many clothes?

673
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,120
Is this a gift for fans of the final?

674
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,520
Jiao Huang, we just studied the competition of all the ZDDX national games.

675
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,320
We have summarized their double C habits. Do you want to take a look?

676
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,720
Jiao Huang.

677
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,920
What's wrong with him?

678
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,320
He is not in the right state after he came back.

679
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,120
Yes, he is not happy.

680
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,320
Did he meet Xiao Si?

681
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,120
How would I know?

682
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,720
I don't know.

683
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,320
Liang Sheng.

684
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,620
I'm sweating.

685
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,520
My heart is beating fast.

686
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,720
What's wrong with me?

687
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,720
I'm nervous.

688
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,320
Nervous?

689
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,520
It's normal. You drink a coke.

690
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,320
Press the bell.

691
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,520
Before the competition, I will never be nervous.

692
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,620
Think about it.

693
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,120
This is the final of the national finals.

694
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,820
And you and Lu Si Cheng are still in the final.

695
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,620
I think you should be nervous.

696
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,820
I'm 26 years old this year.

697
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,820
So?

698
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,020
So, before I came to China,

699
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,220
I didn't treat it as a real battlefield.

700
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,020
I just want to make my career

701
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,820
the last one to be more comfortable.

702
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,620
And then?

703
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,220
I don't know.

704
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,020
Maybe it's because I didn't expect it to be so difficult.

705
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,620
You didn't let me...

706
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,820
How should I say it?

707
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,420
You let me open my eyes.

708
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,820
Open my eyes?

709
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,620
It's just a compliment.

710
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,020
It's just a compliment.

711
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,220
It's just a compliment.

712
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,020
But you still treat me...

713
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,720
You still treat me...

714
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
You're a newbie.

715
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,120
Yes, that's right.

716
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
That's for sure.

717
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
You were good at playing.

718
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,920
That's right, brother.

719
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,520
So, you let me think

720
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,720
that I don't have a chance to go to a higher level.

721
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,320
Although we're just a team,

722
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
we can't go to the national finals all the way.

723
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,720
Yes, for our dream.

724
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,920
Brother, I want to go to the world finals with you.

725
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,920
How about this? Let's get the first place in the national finals.

726
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,120
Come on.

727
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,720
YQCB, the first group.

728
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,120
What are you doing? Come on.

729
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,920
One more time.

730
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,120
Three, two, one.

731
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,120
YQCB, let's get it together.

732
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,320
Come on.

733
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,720
Come on.

734
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Come on.

735
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Come on.

736
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,720
Have you thought about the future?

737
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,320
The world is fair.

738
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,920
Do you want to be so rude?

739
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,120
I hope we can win the championship.

740
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
No.

741
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
Not only the national championship,

742
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,120
but also the world championship.

743
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
That's all?

744
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,120
Are you really not going to tell me?

745
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
I won't tell you if you want to.

746
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
I don't believe it.

747
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,720
Who can control my fate

748
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,120
except myself?

749
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Our future is only between you and me.

750
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
This is it.

751
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,120
What about you?

752
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,520
If you really want to ask me

753
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,120
what I want to do,

754
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,920
I hope

755
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,120
I can be by your side forever.

756
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:30,320
The place you've been filming

757
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,120
is not far away from here.

758
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,520
Do you think we can try?

759
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,120
I can think of it this way.

760
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
I am so nervous.

761
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Are you nervous?

762
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,320
You've been in the front of the game

763
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,400
for more than a thousand times.

764
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,200
Are you nervous?

765
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,040
Don't bully me.

766
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,800
I've never seen a big city.

767
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,760
Just get used to it.

768
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,800
You're going to compete with me

769
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
to win the world stage.

770
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,720
Please welcome the two teams.

are two teams with a strong bond.

780
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,920
Which team will win?

Let's wait and see.

782
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,680
VGTX is a team with a shining star.

00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,200
It's a team with a strong bond

784
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,560
and a strong bond.

785
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,720

787
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,200

00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,400
with a strong bond.

789
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,760
With the help of the coach,

790
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
the front-line is sent to YQCB

791
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,000
with a high-level skill.

792
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,360
Finally, they are on the final stage of the national finals.

Okay.
