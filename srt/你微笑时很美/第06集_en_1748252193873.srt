1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He's always on the top.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Even if he's a bit more experienced,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,600
he can still make it in his lifetime.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,400
That's the top-notch.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,800
He's the top-notch master in the industry.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,800
You mean... Wu Gui?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
You said that A-Tai came to our training camp

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
and would really do this for Tong Yao?

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,800
She would defeat Tong Yao with her early morning.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,400
This is her good play.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
But Tong Yao is the first to defeat her early morning.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,400
She might not be able to win.

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,600
Although she's very stubborn,

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
it's still useful.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm going to be the beauty who can do everything for Tian.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
Even if she's still early morning,

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I can still win.

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
She's quite optimistic.

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,000
First Class

20
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,100
Jing whistle

21
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
How did you sleep?

22
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
I will.

23
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,240
We have building the tomorrow after training from daybreak.

24
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,380
I will call an ambulance,

25
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,740
drive back for Mexican or American...

26
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,220
The calls came from the police...

27
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,060
either at the mountainited哪裡

28
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,540
or from the small hehe position.

29
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,560
And then I need to answer the call and the documents.

30
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,700
Why not call a local?

31
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
Then you just follow it,

32
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,480
It's the first time I've seen you being lied to.

33
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,420
I did have a problem.

34
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
But I forgot to do it.

35
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,380
Ichnporcous gas momentoal.

36
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,380
I was a born-hard person.

37
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,460
It can overcome the kindness of fate.

38
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,100
Trick me please

39
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,760
Japon

40
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,320
Just keep it a secret,

41
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,440
the best looking einem Fortunately,

42
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,040
we can't tell anyone about the publishing genius from Jeだけ.

43
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,480
There is no error in the text,

44
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,360
we turn on the lens again.

45
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,760
More than 2030.

46
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,040
An ink tape that you're з.

47
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,760
Instead, the colors are the same as they deserve.

48
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,720
What is it?

49
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,820
People are using the same lodge time

50
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,980
into the ground to torture them.

51
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,960
Bullshit.

52
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,900
Sword Li meal has been combed.

53
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,740
You really have an idea?

54
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,740
The Point training trip can show some off.

55
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,760
What a coincidence.

56
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,960
You've been winning

57
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,840
throughout the whole year.

58
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
You could only ruined the misson.

59
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,680
Why did you take so many poets

60
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,620
who had never won

61
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,060
their national unfamiliarity.

62
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,260
Don't get emotional in spielen.

63
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,100
There are so many champions.

64
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,460
There are not many people like this team.

65
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,140
It's time to think.

66
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,620
Jiao Huang and Brother Cheng

67
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,820
left TNT.

68
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,060
It's a true choice.

69
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,260
I think their fans are also angry.

70
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,500
I like a team member,

71
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,980
but I hate the team he belongs to.

72
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,500
I'm definitely a bad guy.

73
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,940
The one who blew the air was you.

74
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,300
I called a team of national team

75
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,820
to be louder than anyone.

76
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,940
I'm so happy.

77
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,420
Now I'm getting a little upset.

78
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,660
ZGDX got this weak point.

79
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,860
It's a 8-point draw.

80
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,020
He asked the team to make the middle-aged team back.

81
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,700
My god.

82
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,100
This TNT is too grand.

83
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,180
Why did you put the video on the Internet?

84
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,500
I deliberately wrote it on purpose.

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,460
I forced the club to step forward.

86
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,580
I had to avoid the response.

87
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,900
Then I deliberately fought against Tong Yao.

88
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,980
Now I put the video on the Internet.

89
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,980
I called a netizen.

90
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,940
I reported my mid-aged team.

91
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,300
It's shameless.

92
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,420
It's shameless.

93
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,780
Bing,

94
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,140
your mother's emotions are not very good lately.

95
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,980
You have to be weird.

96
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,860
It's my fault.

97
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,780
I didn't fight with the club.

98
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
I let others bully her.

99
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,500
How long did Xiaoxie come?

100
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,940
She was so cruel.

101
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,340
She wouldn't have been so stubborn.

102
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,620
She wouldn't dare to go to the court.

103
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,140
This girl wouldn't have been self-sufficient.

104
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,580
This is the first time in her life.

105
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,580
If she really doesn't watch the game,

106
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,500
it's not suitable for her to be a professional.

107
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,860
She is a newbie after all.

108
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,980
This kind of thing

109
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,660
should be the first time in her life.

110
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
This is the first time.

111
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,980
As her teammates,

112
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,940
from now on,

113
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,220
we should understand her.

114
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,900
Yes.

115
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,540
She is just a 20-year-old sister.

116
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,620
We have to protect her and love her.

117
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,620
Old Kei,

118
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
do you hear me?

119
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,980
Protect?

120
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,900
Love.

121
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,380
Is she a national level 3 protection animal?

122
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,500
She needs to be protected.

123
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,140
The electronic system is irrelevant.

124
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,060
at the bottom of the image,

125
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,320
you think I will be hurt from watching her?

126
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,420
But what do I care?

127
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,620
You are totally the best.

128
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,580
That's right.

129
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,100
But,

130
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,940
the most important thing is

131
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,900
to protect her.

132
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Story of selecting the best team

133
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,660
is not too short at this point.

134
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,700
Xiao bamboo

135
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,300
is too strong.

136
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,460
to let me marry you.

137
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,740
difficulties.

138
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,460
Your high-징 tight,

139
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,420
is breaking with others.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,140
TLT patents never pass ZGDX.

141
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,620
TAT protects the world.

142
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,580
No one should bother with what's going on.

143
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,500
The person who stir-fired

144
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,860
was the one

145
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,420
to start out again later.

146
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,860
Those rentedァn

147
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,940
were making you happy.

148
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,380
Your happy days

149
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,300
are already ahead of your hearts.

150
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,600
Some ch napalm would let him sleep.

151
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,540
Well, then,

152
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,060
I guess it depends on

153
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,580
god to be honest.

154
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,760
You should get some baby food

155
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:51,920
first.

156
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,720
I'll give you customer travel fee.

157
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,060
Plus,

158
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,800
I feel fifteen yuan all over me.

159
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,780
At the end of the day,

160
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,440
I'll leave everything to you.

161
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,040
Mom and dad wouldn't have managed

162
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,800
to finish your baby.

163
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,840
You're wonderful that you're capable.

164
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,880
Don't become a lady your daughter.

165
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,000
Mom,

166
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,920
stop calling me wife.

167
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,280
systematic Japanese

168
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,960
English

169
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:17,480
of an uneasy case,

170
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,320
it says that

171
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,160
someone has equal property kontroll Application inexpensive

172
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,640
By inside the resort,

173
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,760
the casa and puddle can

174
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
with capacity,

175
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,520
pass even circumstance without actions,

176
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,960
as long as me.

177
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,940
I'll go out and look for me.

178
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,040
Then you should come back.

179
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Don't be late.

180
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,080
You are a girl, you should be careful.

181
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,040
It's good that she went out at this time.

182
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,540
She didn't see those things online.

183
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Did you see it?

184
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Someone actually put out such things like training matches.

185
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,040
Who would dare to go to training matches with them?

186
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
So they can't meet the training match.

187
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
You are not going to meet them?

188
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
So they can't meet the training match.

189
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Usually, they are one team and two teams.

190
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
You are a dog.

191
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
But Tong Yao is probably fine.

192
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
She looks fine on the surface.

193
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
She must be in pain.

194
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
She has been here for so long.

195
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
She never had any communication with Tong Xiao.

196
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
That's right.

197
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,120
I don't know how late she slept last night.

198
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
It's 5.30 in the morning.

199
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
You are out of the game.

200
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Just play it.

201
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Don't come back too late.

202
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Welcome.

203
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
We have a good seat.

204
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Okay.

205
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Come here.

206
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Don't be so happy.

207
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Be happy.

208
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Let's go.

209
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Have a look.

210
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Do you need something to drink?

211
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Thank you.

212
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Look. What do you want to drink?

213
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't drink wine.

214
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
I won't.

215
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
I didn't ask you to drink wine.

216
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
I brought you out to relax.

217
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Have a drink.

218
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Here you are.

219
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Okay.

220
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Pour some ice tea.

221
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Do this.

222
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Two glasses of ice tea.

223
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Okay.

224
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Pour some ice tea.

225
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
It's your strength.

226
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Strength?

227
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Isn't it just a training game?

228
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
When Ai Jia started playing professional games,

229
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
because he was too young and experienced,

230
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
he was hit by someone's heart.

231
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
It's a common thing.

232
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
I was afraid that I would run to the balcony

233
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
and cry.

234
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
It was a small bag.

235
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
But I cried.

236
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
I didn't have to go to the next game

237
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
the next day.

238
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
I didn't have to.

239
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
I cried a lot.

240
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,120
You said you weren't weak last time.

241
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Okay.

242
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Little girl is not ashamed.

243
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
She cried like a ghost.

244
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
She was seen by someone.

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
What did you do?

246
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Drink slowly.

247
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Why are you so busy?

248
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
You're a good girl.

249
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Come on.

250
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Drink with me.

251
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Drink with me.

252
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Who are you?

253
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Just one glass.

254
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Come on.

255
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
What are you doing?

256
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Who are you?

257
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Get out.

258
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
You're a fool.

259
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
How did he know we were here?

260
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Who knows?

261
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
The dog must be sniffing.

262
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I changed your makeup last time.

263
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I was taken care of.

264
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Aijia.

265
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Can you control your eyes?

266
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Old woman.

267
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Old woman.

268
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Old woman.

269
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Yangyang.

270
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Old woman.

271
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
You.

272
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Do that side.

273
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Wait for me to finish my sister.

274
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Yangyang.

275
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Since it's a competition,

276
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
there must be a winner.

277
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Think about it.

278
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
How could you keep winning?

279
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
It's just a training competition.

280
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
You still have the whole national team.

281
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Why do you care about what others say?

282
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
How about this?

283
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I'll buy you a water bottle.

284
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
And you can go home.

285
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Right.

286
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Who hasn't lost?

287
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Although I don't know that girl,

288
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
don't worry.

289
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
As long as I meet her,

290
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I'll help you get out.

291
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Shut up.

292
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm not going to go home.

293
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm going to go home.

294
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm going to go home.

295
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm going to go home.

296
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm going to go home.

297
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Shut up.

298
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
You're the one who's talking.

299
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
She's blind or blind?

300
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
You're helping her.

301
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
I didn't mean that.

302
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
I just asked you to sit over there.

303
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Go.

304
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Jinwei.

305
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Tell me.

306
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
How could you be so strong?

307
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,280
How about I give you a

308
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,360
Las Vegas copper-plated men's show?

309
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Come on.

310
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
The chance is here.

311
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
But to tell you the truth,

312
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I still don't know how to use your

313
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,760
good-for-nothing

314
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,360
to defeat you.

315
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Why do you have to use

316
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
such professional players?

317
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
The old-fashioned way of retreating

318
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
is that

319
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
I didn't expect that today

320
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
the same is the case.

321
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
In a sense,

322
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
is it not that I'm using my best

323
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
to defeat people

324
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
on the scene

325
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
to make people angry?

326
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Of course not.

327
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Because the so-called

328
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
good-for-nothing to a god,

329
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
not only to solve the problem

330
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
of this god,

331
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
but also to make people angry

332
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
and to make people angry.

333
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
It's not only to use

334
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
the skill-solving and skill-training

335
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
of this god,

336
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
but also to include

337
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
the understanding of the whole game.

338
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
So once you're defeated,

339
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
you'll feel very defeated.

340
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
You still don't understand?

341
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Then let me put it this way.

342
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
You've been good at English since you were a kid.

343
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
You can even talk to

344
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
foreigners

345
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
around you.

346
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
There's nothing to talk about

347
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
in school.

348
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
You're the only one

349
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
who can't talk about you.

350
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
You're the legend of this city.

351
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Until one day,

352
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
you won the first prize

353
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
of the whole game

354
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
and participated in a national

355
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
English game,

356
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
you'll find that

357
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
anyone in it

358
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
can be as mischievous as you.

359
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Some people even say that

360
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
they're not even thinking about

361
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
what they're talking about

362
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
with their lives.

363
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
When you're in a daze

364
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
and you don't know what's wrong,

365
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
they'll come back to laugh at you

366
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
and say that you're the one

367
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
who can participate in the game.

368
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
What will you think?

369
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
I'll say something else.

370
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
If you're a foreigner

371
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
who can participate in the game,

372
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
there's a person who speaks Japanese very well.

373
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
You can't even

374
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
understand what he's saying.

375
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
What will you think?

376
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
You just think

377
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
that this person's Japanese is good.

378
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
But I'm not good at it.

379
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
I don't usually speak Japanese.

380
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
If you say that...

381
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
So, the same thing

382
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
as before,

383
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
it's a kind of...

384
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
What is a kind of?

385
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Forget it.

386
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
As a professional player,

387
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
he has to deal with these things sooner or later.

388
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
As a professional player,

389
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,480
he has to deal with these things sooner or later.

390
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Stop reading these things.

391
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
I asked you to come here and enjoy yourself.

392
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Stop reading these terrible things.

393
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
I asked you to come here and enjoy yourself.

394
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,760
You're drunk.

395
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,120
Waitress,

396
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,640
bring me another cup of ice tea.

397
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,640
Sit down.

398
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,440
It's more like a ghost than a normal one.

399
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,320
Jiao Yao.

400
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,760
Why is she here?

401
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,280
You're a genius.

402
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
You don't want it anymore?

403
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,720
Come here.

404
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:54,920
This...

405
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,560
I'll do it.

406
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,280
What are you doing?

407
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm here.

408
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,560
She and I are a couple.

409
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,960
That's great.

410
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,160
Lian Lian, don't drink it.

411
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,480
Sit down.

412
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:17,880
Let's go.

413
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,760
I'll take you to the wedding.

414
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,680
Take a breath.

415
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,840
I'm not on the live broadcast.

416
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm not on the stage or the game.

417
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Why should I wash my face?

418
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,160
Who are you?

419
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,320
It's 11 o'clock.

420
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
Why hasn't Tong Xiao come back yet?

421
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,560
She won't go to the beach, right?

422
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,240
Let's drink.

423
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,800
Come on.

424
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,080
Why are you looking for Lu Si Cheng?

425
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm looking for Jian Yang.

426
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm looking for him.

427
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
I'm looking for him.

428
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,480
Is Jian Yang back?

429
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,360
Maybe they're together tonight.

430
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,080
What?

431
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,960
Do I agree?

432
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,040
A man who's lying and cheating

433
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,400
doesn't deserve to be with me.

434
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,040
It's a misunderstanding.

435
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,840
Jian Yang always likes Dong Yang.

436
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,280
Don't take it as a excuse.

437
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,240
Besides,

438
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,640
Tong Xiao doesn't like Jian Yang.

439
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,560
Why does he like to work?

440
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,920
It's not his job and his man.

441
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,160
Besides,

442
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,320
if he likes him,

443
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
why would he break up?

444
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,880
We don't want to break up

445
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,160
because we like him.

446
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,000
We're in a relationship.

447
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,680
It's normal.

448
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,120
Anyway, I'm against Jian Yang.

449
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,880
Jian Yang is my brother.

450
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,640
Tong Xiao is my best friend.

451
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,000
He's a good friend.

452
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
After all, we're sisters.

453
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
There's one who's blind.

454
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,320
Blind?

455
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,120
Who's blind?

456
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,880
Me.

457
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,280
Really?

458
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,960
I see.

459
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,920
I see.

460
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,840
Why are you blind?

461
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,800
Get lost.

462
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,880
Yao Yao.

463
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,600
I know you lost the game.

464
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
You're not happy.

465
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,880
But you can't

466
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
use alcohol to offend yourself.

467
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,480
You can't refuse

468
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,880
everyone's concern for you.

469
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
I've thought a lot

470
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,320
during this time.

471
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,240
I was wrong in the past.

472
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
I shouldn't lie.

473
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,200
I shouldn't have

474
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,000
explained it to you.

475
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,200
Now I understand.

476
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,200
Yao Yao.

477
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,440
I really can't lose you.

478
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,000
Without you,

479
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,280
I can't even play the game.

480
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,320
I'll read every news of you.

481
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,760
When I see you're doing well

482
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,680
and not doing well,

483
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,040
I feel sad.

484
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,120
I feel sad when you're doing well.

485
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,800
Because I'm not the one

486
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,640
who makes you happy.

487
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,640
When I see you're not doing well,

488
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,040
I want to be with you.

489
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,520
Although I should tell you

490
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,040
these words when you're happy,

491
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,040
I still can't help it.

492
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,360
Give me another chance.

493
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,520
Let's make a deal.

494
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,520
Okay?

495
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,480
Where's my phone?

496
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,320
Where's my phone?

497
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,240
It's here.

498
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
Come here.

499
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Give them some space.

500
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,880
Tong Xiao is feeling sad.

501
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,160
In the end,

502
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,240
you're not like those

503
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,040
old people.

504
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,120
Teng Tian Yang.

505
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,120
I'm not scolding you,

506
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,520
but don't call me old people.

507
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll sue you for being rude.

508
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,440
How about it?

509
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,320
You dare to keep your mouth shut?

510
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,280
You're always on the computer.

511
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,440
You're not old people.

512
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,560
Cheng Xu Yuan is always on the computer.

513
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,120
We're professional players.

514
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,320
Athletes.

515
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,120
You're kidding me.

516
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,480
Professional players.

517
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,680
Do you have a clue?

518
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,480
I don't like to hear that.

519
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,560
Why don't you have a clue?

520
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,920
The light of the United States is still coming.

521
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,080
Don't be angry.

522
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,400
Don't be angry.

523
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,940
isan lover.

524
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,440
All right.

525
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,120
We'll sell it out

526
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,360
if we get some more,

527
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,320
you can do it.

528
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,240
Just accept it.

529
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
What do they say?

530
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
We can just be ourselves.

531
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Let's go. Don't drink. I'll take you back.

532
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Jian Yang, you don't understand me at all.

533
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,240
You don't know what I care about at all.

534
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,240
What I care about is not what those people on the Internet said.

535
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Those plushies can't beat me at all.

536
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,240
What I care about is that Yu Xiaoxian is a kind of person who loves me.

537
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Are you okay?

538
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Jian Yang, what's wrong with you?

539
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
You just made me vomit.

540
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
He said he doesn't know what he cares about.

541
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
I know that.

542
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,240
What you care about is that you're defeated by someone who you know.

543
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
I know that feeling.

544
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
You know a ghost?

545
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
No, I don't.

546
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Do you want to go up or down?

547
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Go up or down?

548
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,240
No.

549
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
No.

550
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,240
You're finally here.

551
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Wake up. I'm coming to pick you up.

552
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,240
I don't know why I feel like seeing our captain.

553
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
He's so fierce and silly.

554
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
He wants to throw me into the sea.

555
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I'll send you a boat tomorrow.

556
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
How did he become like this?

557
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
He's in a bad mood.

558
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,240
I took a photo of him and went up to the Internet to watch those crazy words.

559
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
But I didn't expect him to drink it.

560
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Where? I drank the red tea.

561
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
Yu Zui.

562
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Why are you so fierce in your dream?

563
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I'll take him back now.

564
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
I'll take him back.

565
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
I'm the captain of the team.

566
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
I have the intention to send him back to the base.

567
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
I'm his ex-boyfriend.

568
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
That's the past.

569
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
Let's go.

570
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
What do you want?

571
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
I'll take him back.

572
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
What are you doing?

573
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Let them alone in the Gu Nang管ry.

574
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm not worried.

575
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Jian Yang.

576
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
You and Tong Yao have broken up.

577
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I'm taking off my shoes.

578
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
I'm taking off my shoes.

579
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Where's my slippers?

580
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
They're in my hand.

581
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,240
I want to wear them.

582
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Why don't you walk?

583
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I'll walk.

584
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Why don't you walk?

585
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I'll throw you down.

586
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
What?

587
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Why are you so fierce?

588
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Can you be kind?

589
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
You're my kindest pupil.

590
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Child.

591
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Do you know that

592
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
the sound of the electric piano is normal?

593
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Yes.

594
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Did you tell me before?

595
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Do you know that

596
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
no matter how others judge you,

597
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,240
you can't be a good electric piano player?

598
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
I know.

599
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,240
So I don't care about those stupid words.

600
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Brother Cheng.

601
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
I'm not because of Shu Ying

602
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
or those words.

603
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Or my own self-esteem is hard.

604
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,240
I don't like to drag my teammates.

605
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,240
I'm anxious, anxious, sad, and selfish.

606
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Can I really do well?

607
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Can I really play this game?

608
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,240
I can only play the game of Yu Zaoqian.

609
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
They don't understand

610
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,240
that Yu Zaoqian is...

611
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Who's a trustee?

612
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Yes.

613
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Brother Cheng.

614
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
I'm out of my mind.

615
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
What should I do?

616
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
How about

617
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
building a new trust

618
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
with the determination to win?

619
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
How can it be so easy?

620
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
How do you know if you don't try?

621
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I just know if I try.

622
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
If you want to know,

623
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,240
you were chosen by hundreds of people.

624
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Do you have a vision?

625
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
I can teach you, too.

626
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Brother Cheng, you're lying.

627
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
You're so strong.

628
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
How can you be so weak?

629
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
You can't teach me this kind of thing.

630
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
You're so strong.

631
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Why don't you speak?

632
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,240
I suddenly feel like you're right.

633
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,240
How could it be so easy?

634
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Wake up.

635
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
If you go back earlier,

636
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
倍 will surely scold you.

637
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
I'll buy you a new gun.

638
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Wait for me right here.

639
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,040
What are you waiting for?

640
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,520
You've been so good at it,

641
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,720
and you almost got me.

642
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,920
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

643
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,640
Are you going to fall?

644
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,600
Are you going to fall?

645
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,800
Are you going to fall?

646
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,480
Fall?

647
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,040
No.

648
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,680
Give me five minutes.

649
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,800
I can't take it anymore.

650
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,080
I have to walk from here

651
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,720
to the gate of the community.

652
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,160
What if there's a wolf?

653
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,840
The wolf can't see you.

654
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,240
Me too.

655
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,080
Go ahead.

656
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm not going anywhere.

657
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,600
From now on,

658
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,880
I'm the only one who's not coming.

659
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,600
If you don't come,

660
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,520
I'm not going anywhere.

661
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,720
You've been drinking for a long time.

662
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,640
You're quite cultured.

663
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,080
You know how to keep your distance.

664
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,920
Fine.

665
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,960
I'll give you a hand.

666
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,960
Idiot.

667
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,480
I'm not drunk.

668
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,080
I'm not a sober person.

669
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,800
I was just talking to you about life.

670
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm sober.

671
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,320
We're going to sleep.

672
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,760
The tiger is still here.

673
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,120
I'm back.

674
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:28,320
Produced by

675
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,000
Screw you!!!

676
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,060
The bed improvements are ancient,

677
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,700
but I'm kept strategies and tactics.

678
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,540
It's all the things that woke me up.

679
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,960
Hey,

680
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,180
we're a bunch ofUsownQi and are not our business.

681
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,300
Why do you keep fighting?

682
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,500
So clear!

683
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,060
to admit what I did today.

684
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,700
How about it?

685
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,420
I can be quiet for a month.

686
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,100
You're a stupid and wrong person.

687
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,140
Why did you mention me?

688
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,420
You're like a pig.

689
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,540
I'm going to kill you.

690
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,060
No.

691
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,340
One, two.

692
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,060
You dare.

693
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,740
Why are you here?

694
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,940
Why are you...

695
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,540
You're not a ghost.

696
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,620
Have you seen a ghost as handsome as me?

697
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,420
You two look alike.

698
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,780
You're born in the same place.

699
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,020
Of course you look alike.

700
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,500
Lu Yue.

701
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,940
God of Light.

702
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,860
From the follow stitch,

703
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,780
Sometimes you really have beenvolvaged with bad luck.

704
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,460
When you broke up with men at the Sutor Department,

705
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,580
you show off pretty much everything you got.

706
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,580
Tell me.

707
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,740
What have you come back for?

708
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,020
I was going to go to Kenya

709
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,260
to watch the weird cat's play,

710
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,980
but I saw a new heart rate

711
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,620
and I was attacked by that smilin' girl.

712
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,180
It's time to go back to work.

713
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,380
So,

714
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,060
you're the one who was bullied by A-Tai

715
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,460
and bullied by a poor girl.

716
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,340
Did you ask her?

717
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,500
I asked.

718
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,140
I saw your information

719
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,460
and thought it was your girlfriend.

720
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,860
I almost sent a message to my mom.

721
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,940
She likes women when she's her son.

722
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,780
She can say a good name

723
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,820
when she's her son.

724
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,860
Shut up.

725
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,220
Lu Yuanyuan, you're still the same.

726
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,940
You don't have any evidence.

727
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,860
But let me tell you,

728
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,780
we have a new order.

729
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,660
Come back later.

730
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,220
What?

731
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,940
What's the matter?

732
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,780
I was bullied.

733
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,020
It's useless to be back so early.

734
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
What?

735
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,420
You were bullied?

736
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,140
I'm so happy to see you.

737
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,580
Is there anyone who can control me?

738
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,500
Well,

739
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,380
ZGDX

740
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,020
hasn't made a decision

741
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,580
to sign the contract for the national championship.

742
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,580
Ming Shen,

743
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,860
I'll play the game first.

744
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,620
No.

745
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,140
Oh.

746
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,380
I'll send you a message.

747
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,460
The weather has been getting better recently.

748
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,620
My brother's team

749
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,780
wants to give him a warm clothes.

750
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,980
But they see

751
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,060
the rumors about him

752
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,500
are coming from China.

753
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,060
He's with my brother

754
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,220
on the bed.

755
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,260
Yongwen?

756
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,820
Take a look.

757
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,380
And I'll ask your brother

758
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,620
to go there to play against me.

759
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,340
I have no idea.

760
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,220
Your brother really likes being dragged

761
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,060
I...

762
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,180
I...

763
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,820
My dream is very important.

764
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,420
You've been through a lot of heat and suffering.

765
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,860
But what about people?

766
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,140
Sometimes you still have to face reality.

767
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,580
You're not shouting to make a statement.

768
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,380
The champion's prize will be in the bowl, right?

769
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,700
Am I going to be a substitute for T-Boo?

770
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,260
Am I going to be the only one

771
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,100
who can't be on the T-Boo

772
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,020
in the national championship?

773
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,220
Can't I never be on the national championship?

774
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
I don't want to.

775
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,820
I want to be on the national championship.

776
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,460
You can't put me on the T-Boo.

777
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,140
I just lost one game.

778
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,220
I shouldn't have won the championship.

779
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,420
Tian Yang, how much did you drink?

780
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,380
No, I didn't drink.

781
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,860
I drank the ice cream.

782
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
I didn't drink the most.

783
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,020
Brother Cheng, I want to be a professional.

784
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,100
I want to take revenge.

785
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,980
I'm strong.

786
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,580
You can't let me watch the championship.

787
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,140
Brother Cheng, how much did he drink?

788
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,900
I don't understand.

789
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,980
Him catching up withvaluita

790
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,940
and sell a drink for the youth guy

791
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,700
can help Weg الخn...

792
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,140
Brother Cheng, it's for you.

793
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,540
This is what I'm giving you

794
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,100
with the aspiration as an tänation man.

795
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,980
Did you see that?

796
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,100
One departments have oneoteelepons.

797
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
One of them has only one fan.

798
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
We are full of fame.

799
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,100
You can ask if other teams need it.

800
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
What?

801
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
I'll go now.

802
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
You can throw it to you.

803
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
This one to you.

804
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
This one to you.

805
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Goodbye.

806
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
Farewell.

807
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Bye.

808
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,100
I started to believe in the existence of tacit understanding.

809
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Fate can be changed because of persistence.

810
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
I won't confess.

811
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,100
I only know how much I've confessed.

812
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Tomorrow is the last time I'll be in love.

813
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:07,100
Your eyes make me fall in love.

814
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:14,100
We are together.

815
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:21,100
We are together.

816
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
Do you still remember?

817
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
I spent my time with you.

818
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
How many times have I heard?

819
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
I'll take care of the rest of the things.

820
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
We are all set.

821
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Youth is not like a river.

822
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:45,100
If I have a dream,

823
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,100
I'll chase after the light.

824
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:55,100
I'll chase after the light.

825
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,100
If I have a dream,

826
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,100
I'll chase after the light.

827
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:08,100
So we are looking forward.

828
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
We will burn the darkness.

829
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,100
How many times have I heard?

830
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,100
How many times have I heard?

831
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:23,100
I'll take care of the rest of the things.

832
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,100
We are all set.

833
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,100
I'll take care of the rest of the things.

834
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,100
I'll chase after the light.

835
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,100
I'll chase after the light.

836
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:50,100
I'll chase after the light.

837
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:55,100
I'll chase after the light.
