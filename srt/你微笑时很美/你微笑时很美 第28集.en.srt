1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,710
Whether it's esports or her,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,730
I just want to love what I love.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,150
You higher-ups can make Team ZGDX's members feel disappointed,

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,810
but I can't.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,480
Because I'm the captain.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,390
Hello. Go ahead.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,400
What did I do wrong?

8
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,110
[Falling into your smile]

9
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,910
[Episode 28]

10
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,979
Throughout the match,

11
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,780
Team YQCB's impeccable defense and zero mistakes

12
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,650
were the key to their victory.

13
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,710
In contrast,

14
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,290
we made frequent positioning errors,

15
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,490
miscommunications,

16
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,190
and were slow to react with support.

17
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,590
But the biggest issue was overconfidence.

18
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,490
In the previous round, Youko wasn't in an advantageous position,

19
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,290
and that's on me.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,390
I shouldn't have indulged you.

21
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,250
The next round is very important.

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,390
Cooperate well.

23
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,829
None of the three lanes can be lost.

24
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,030
Focus on the defense.

25
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,990
They want to do it steadily.

26
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,650
We should do it more steadily.

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,950
Cheng, pay attention to farming and push the lane in the early stage.

28
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,620
We can't give Pope any chance.

29
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,390
Cheng.

30
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,910
I know Li Junhe very well.

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,550
If we don't control him early

32
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,150
and keep him under pressure,

33
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,510
we'll be

34
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,270
in a world of trouble in the late game.

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,380
That's why you picked Youko?

36
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,280
Before level six, Youko can completely

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,310
outplay Chin in laning in the early stage.

38
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,630
As long as there's no high burst damage in the late game,

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,090
we should be able to dominate in team fights.

40
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,770
So we have to make it quick.

41
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,430
Why is everyone so quiet?

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,840
Welcome back.

43
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,430
You're watching the live broadcast

44
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,910
of the second round between

45
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,350
Team ZGDX and Team YQCB.

46
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,550
I'm your commentator Xiaofan.

47
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,510
I'm your commentator Chen Yao.

48
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:54,950
Alright.

49
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,550
As we can see, both teams

50
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,329
are ready.

51
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,120
Team YQCB has banned

52
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,390
Kosodenote, Yamakaze, and Tamamonomae.

53
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,270
And Team ZGDX has banned

54
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,590
Aoandon, Yamausagi, and Shuten Doji.

55
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,740
Now let's see

56
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,710
what Smiling

57
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,540
is going to pick for the mid lane.

58
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,850
I guess she'll pick Ootengu again.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,050
Yuki Onna?

60
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,110
Oh my God! She picked Yuki Onna!

61
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,550
They want to use the "Protect the Carry" strategy now?

62
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,600
Yuki Onna?

63
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,470
To be honest, I don't understand

64
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,820
why she picked Yuki Onna.

65
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,460
Their opponent is Team YQCB.

66
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,330
Will the "Protect the Carry" strategy work?

67
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,860
I don't understand either.

68
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,560
Cheng.

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,550
Hannya.

70
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,260
Okay.

71
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,390
What?

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,680
After Smiling picked Yuki Onna,

73
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,330
Team ZGDX's another member picked Hannya!

74
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,950
What kind of combination is this?

75
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,430
According to the current lineup,

76
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,870
I think it might be like this:

77
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,970
Hannya and Ibaraki Doji go to the bottom lane.

78
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,860
Yuki Onna is the mid laner.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,490
The top laner is Onikiri.

80
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,940
Onikiri is the mid laner?

81
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,790
What world are we in right now?

82
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,750
I'm a bit overwhelmed.

83
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,670
These players are so unpredictable.

84
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,460
They just kept giving me a slap in the face.

85
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,590
I'm a little upset. I'll stop talking.

86
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,550
Alright, the game

87
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,830
is now at the 13-minute mark.

88
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,930
Team ZGDX...

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,560
Team YQCB has been incredibly patient.

90
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,990
It's been over ten minutes.

91
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,310
They've just been killing minions and pushing the lane.

92
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,840
I have no one to ambush. I'm not used to this.

93
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,470
The economies and items are pretty much the same.

94
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,810
They are waiting for a chance.

95
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,020
Now it's all about who makes the first mistake.

96
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,500
Also, their lineup in this round is quite confusing.

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,220
Pang, give some vision.

98
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,120
I'm coming.

99
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,909
Okay.

100
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,650
K is coming.

101
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,250
Me too.

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,400
Me too.

103
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,340
Engage.

104
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,700
What?

105
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,370
So much for farming peacefully.

106
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,620
Four of them came here.

107
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,870
Cheng is already at low HP

108
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,750
shortly after my shield held up.

109
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,710
I'll be right there. I'll flank from behind.

110
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,380
Wait for me. Don't rush in.

111
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,470
Alright, we can see

112
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,690
Yuki Onna has activated her ultimate move to buy time.

113
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,270
And Onikiri and Ibaraki Doji have activated Shift.

114
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,909
Retreat.

115
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,990
Chessman is at low HP.

116
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,160
You want to be killed by Smiling at the bottom turret?

117
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,960
I don't want to sacrifice my ADC.

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,270
Miss,

119
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,560
are they afraid of you?

120
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,760
Why did they retreat as soon as you came?

121
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,630
They left right after I came.

122
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,270
Come on.

123
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,980
I rushed all the way here, and now the economy's been wasted.

124
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,330
Team YQCB is so controlled.

125
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,090
If they waited for just half a second for my shield to finish,

126
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,280
a few more basic attacks would have killed the captain.

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,520
Team YQCB's playstyle has changed.

128
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,590
They want to play a long game now.

129
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,090
So in the late-game team fights,

130
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,260
we must be careful.

131
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,240
In contrast,

132
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,880
Team ZGDX's players

133
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,250
are quick to react, great with positioning,

134
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,909
and their support awareness is stronger.

135
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:35,950
Still the same old story.

136
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,000
The current situation

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,340
doesn't look very optimistic.

138
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,390
The rest depends on

139
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,990
who has stronger endurance.

140
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,290
But look at their performance today.

141
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,909
It feels like the situation is the opposite.

142
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,670
Ai Jia,

143
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,270
come to the mid lane to buy some time with me.

144
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,630
Cover Pope and the others taking Orochi.

145
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,150
Okay.

146
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,830
They will try to steal.

147
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,860
I'm faster than Yasha.

148
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,120
My ultimate move is waiting for Smiling.

149
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,470
Once she shows up, I'll kill her.

150
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,490
Team YQCB's ADC and jungler are targeting Orochi.

151
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,520
We can't let them succeed.

152
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,170
Dodomeki and Yoto Hime are very fast.

153
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,350
We might not be able to take it even with my suppression.

154
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,680
Yeah, let's split push.

155
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,600
No, we can't let them take Orochi. Cat, team fight!

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,750
I'll flank from the side.

157
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,950
Kill Menreiki first.

158
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,170
Did you have to do that?

159
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,040
You killed me as soon as you engaged.

160
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,430
They're stealing Orochi hastily.

161
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,320
Watch your positioning.

162
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,360
Rong Rong, stall Hannya.

163
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,430
Make sure Pope and the others take Orochi.

164
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,940
K will definitely come for it.

165
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,270
Xbang, use suppression first.

166
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,330
K, come and take it.

167
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,310
Okay.

168
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,570
K is trying to steal Orochi!

169
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,380
Yoto Hime has taken Orochi! Retreat!

170
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,710
They have Kirin! We're at a disadvantage!

171
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,520
He failed. Team YQCB has got Orochi!

172
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,159
We're feeding them kills. You guys retreat!

173
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
Yoto Hime is at low HP. Onikiri, finish him off.

174
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,310
Retreat. We can't fight anymore.

175
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,190
We can't get to their backline.

176
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,950
And Dodomeki's damage is too high.

177
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,750
Retreat. Tong Yao is also at low HP.

178
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,990
Retreat.

179
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,320
Retreat, Cheng. The situation is not good.

180
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,020
Retreat. I can't protect you anymore.

181
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,830
I can do it.

182
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,050
I can do it.

183
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,630
I can do it.

184
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,030
I can do it.

185
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,590
Yes.

186
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,850
If they still don't retreat and get wiped,

187
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,820
the result of this round

188
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,160
will be quite clear.

189
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,690
I can do it.

190
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,790
Wonderful!

191
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,480
Chessman and Smiling collaborated

192
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,920
to kill Rong Rong!

193
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,870
Smiling was killed by Pope.

194
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,000
Chessman is still struggling.

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:12,120
Pope! Pope! Pope!

196
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,960
Team wipe!

197
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,320
Push to the high ground!

198
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,020
Team ZGDX's base has been destroyed!

199
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,060
Let's congratulate Team YQCB

200
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,900
on winning this match!

201
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,020
Congratulations to Team YQCB!

202
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,070
Nice!

203
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,720
We played so well just now.

204
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,230
We won!

205
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,670
Ai Jia, do you think my performance was good or not?

206
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,860
Good. Nice. Nice.

207
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,460
Nice, nice.

208
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,380
Of course.

209
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,630
Let's go.

210
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,330
Let's go.

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,440
Thank you.

212
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,120
Thank you.

213
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,720
Thank you.

214
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,690
Thank you.

215
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,340
Thank you.

216
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,060
Thank you.

217
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,410
-Thank you. Keep going.
-Thank you.

218
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,350
Congratulations.

219
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,950
Thank you.

220
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,100
Keep going.

221
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,570
Cheng.

222
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,370
Well done.

223
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,190
I'm surprised that a girl could do that.

224
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,220
Thank you.

225
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,830
Chessman's hand injury... relapsed?

226
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,670
Smiling.

227
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,640
Take good care of him.

228
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,080
Alright.

229
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,150
Everyone, stop looking like it's the end of the world.

230
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,230
We just lost a regular game.

231
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,030
It's nothing.

232
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,150
We win some, we lose some, right?

233
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,100
Although we lost this game,

234
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,980
as long as we win the next one,

235
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,110
everything will still be fine, right?

236
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,180
Really.

237
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,180
Just talk to me.

238
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,090
Look at me.

239
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,180
One match doesn't mean anything.

240
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,720
What impact can it have on us?

241
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,340
We'll just cut back on browsing Weibo

242
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,180
and presenting livestreaming shows.

243
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,740
Right?

244
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,030
God Ming.

245
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,310
Everyone, calm down first.

246
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,710
Tomorrow, we can analyze why we lost the game.

247
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,950
Why we lost the game?

248
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,030
Before we put the blame on ourselves,

249
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,360
shouldn't we settle a few other matters first?

250
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,920
Cat.

251
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,780
What?

252
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,330
Can't I talk?

253
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,849
Everyone, rest early today.

254
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,910
Tomorrow, we'll prepare for the game.

255
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,109
Prepare for the game?

256
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,650
Captain.

257
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,140
Is that all you have to say?

258
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,470
Don't you have

259
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,930
anything to explain to us?

260
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,579
What do you want me to say?

261
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,950
Cat, calm down.

262
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,170
I'll be frank then.

263
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,790
During training, you went out early and came back late.

264
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,720
Where did you go?

265
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,610
You were distracted and absent-minded.

266
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,970
When God Ming was talking about tactics,

267
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,460
were you even listening?

268
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,700
How much of it did you actually get?

269
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,740
Also,

270
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,500
what on earth happened today?

271
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,870
Why didn't you pick Komatsu like you did

272
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,750
during training?

273
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,150
Why did you pick Youko?

274
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,910
Who are you to change God Ming's strategy?

275
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,750
We have a ton of questions.

276
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,940
Aren't you going to say something?

277
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,320
Don't tell me

278
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,750
you picked Youko just to show off in front of Pope.

279
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,750
Before the match,

280
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,550
I heard you

281
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,410
tell God Ming that in the hallway.

282
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:55,900
Cat.

283
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,750
Cheng,

284
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,850
I only need an explanation.

285
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Before the match,

286
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,810
Cheng came to me alone.

287
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,930
God Ming,

288
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,870
I can't pick Komatsu this time.

289
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,870
Let me pick Youko.

290
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,960
We don't have time to practice

291
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,070
new tactics.

292
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,250
At least tell me why.

293
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,280
No reason.

294
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,460
I just don't want to pick a durable shikigami.

295
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,390
Youko can suppress Pope in the early stage.

296
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,720
If we don't let him farm,

297
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,780
maybe we can end the game as soon as possible.

298
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,500
Why do you want to end the game as soon as possible?

299
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,270
I remember I already analyzed it for you.

300
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,210
This is a tough battle.

301
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,270
It's a battle of endurance.

302
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,670
All that matters is our stamina and strength.

303
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,310
God Ming,

304
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,630
I can't play a long game.

305
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,630
Give me an explanation.

306
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,560
No explanation.

307
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Pope is mine.

308
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,830
Cheng told me before the match

309
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,030
that he'd pick Youko.

310
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,910
But Cheng,

311
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,150
I need an explanation.

312
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,040
You all misunderstood.

313
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,750
Cheng's hand injury relapsed.

314
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,590
Your hand is injured?

315
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,520
That's why Cheng wanted to end it as soon as possible?

316
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,470
Cheng.

317
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,110
Say something.

318
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Where did you go?

319
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,190
Why did you hurt your hand before the match?

320
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,140
Yesterday's practice match didn't go well,

321
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,440
so Cheng stayed up all night playing ranked matches.

322
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,210
You stayed up all night because the practice match didn't go well?

323
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:25,900
Captain,

324
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,030
the whole world knows

325
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,620
you can't practice like that with your hand.

326
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,520
Have you forgotten how God Ming retired?

327
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,240
What? Did you feel guilty?

328
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,910
What did you do earlier?

329
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,140
You think you weren't in a good state due to inadequate training.

330
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,390
Then here we are again.

331
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,310
What have you been doing all this time?

332
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,120
Cheng went to handle Tong Yao's problem.

333
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,800
Handle Tong Yao's problem?

334
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,650
H-How?

335
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,460
Cheng used his connections with the police

336
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,550
to investigate the background of Momo is the Devil.

337
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,870
The police found this person is in Shenzhen.

338
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,590
And?

339
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,670
And it's

340
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,710
just like what Cheng guessed.

341
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,190
She caused the trouble deliberately.

342
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,310
She didn't commit suicide.

343
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,820
She's not a ninth grader either.

344
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,390
She's in the police station now.

345
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,870
Tong Yao, get ready.

346
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,850
In a few days, we'll go to the police station

347
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,040
and face this person head-on.

348
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,600
I...

349
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,250
I was ready to apologize.

350
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,220
Captain!

351
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,080
If Rui didn't receive the call, you'd

352
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,810
avoid this forever. Is that so?

353
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,380
What's wrong with you?

354
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
You didn't tell us your hand is injured.

355
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,920
You even went to handle Tong Yao's problem

356
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,050
without telling us.

357
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,440
Were you worried that we wouldn't let you go

358
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,470
or were you worried that we'd insist you pick

359
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,860
that damn Komatsu despite your hand injury?

360
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,740
Why didn't you

361
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,370
tell us or discuss with us

362
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,340
beforehand?

363
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,180
Were you unwilling to tell us

364
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,550
or you don't believe us,

365
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,250
your teammates, at all?

366
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,440
Yes.

367
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,170
Tong Yao is your girlfriend.

368
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,030
But have you ever thought about this?

369
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,710
She is not just your girlfriend.

370
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,510
She's also our teammate.

371
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,490
She was wronged outside.

372
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,130
She was treated unfairly.

373
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,580
Would we just ignore it?

374
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,980
Would we not let you go?

375
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,900
That's right.

376
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,620
We just

377
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,910
lost one game today.

378
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,670
But I feel so frustrated, you know?

379
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,670
It's not because we lost today.

380
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,870
It's because I found that you, Lu Sicheng,

381
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,070
don't trust your teammates at all!

382
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,190
If you don't need your teammates,

383
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,390
I want to tell you

384
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,430
we don't want a captain like you.

385
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,830
Cat.

386
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,750
-Cat!
-Cat!

387
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,210
Hurry!

388
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:53,810
Cat!

389
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,690
Where are you going?

390
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,900
What are you doing?

391
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,540
Cat.

392
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,640
What else can I do?

393
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm going home.

394
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,860
Stop saying things out of anger, okay?

395
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,260
I'm not!

396
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,910
You should know

397
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,120
that after this year, I'll be pretty much retiring.

398
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,250
If I can't get a spot in the World Championship this year,

399
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,110
there would be

400
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,040
no hope left for my esports career.

401
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,350
You know what?

402
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,900
My parents don't agree with me playing esports.

403
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,270
If I can't achieve anything this year,

404
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,120
how can I face my family?

405
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,410
If this continues,

406
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,480
will we end up being forced to quit

407
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,210
like God Ming did last year due to his hand injury?

408
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,420
Are you worried?

409
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,670
Are you worried?

410
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Even if you're not worried, I am!

411
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,510
Don't go, Cat.

412
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,170
Cat.

413
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:35,950
Cat.

414
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,780
Cat.

415
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,910
Look. You did say those things out of anger.

416
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,310
Quit? No one said anything about quitting.

417
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,570
Cheng's hand injury relapsed.

418
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,440
But his hand is not broken.

419
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,430
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?

420
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,170
I sat right next to him during today's match.

421
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,630
I saw everything clearly.

422
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,120
His performance only started

423
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,360
showing slight issues towards the end.

424
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,720
Before he told you, you didn't notice it at all.

425
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,240
Right?

426
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,860
So,

427
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,990
relax.

428
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,540
Peace and love.

429
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,470
The most important thing now is to face it together

430
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,730
and solve the problem.

431
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,810
Given the current situation, how can we face it together?

432
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,070
Does he even plan to bring us along?

433
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,960
Cat.

434
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,510
You're playing esports for yourself,

435
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,640
not for anyone else.

436
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,030
You said that yourself.

437
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,790
Have you forgotten?

438
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,750
My dream

439
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,530
is to win every game with my teammates

440
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,650
on the battlefield.

441
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,970
Not like this!

442
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,160
That's also what I think.

443
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,840
Yes.

444
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,870
I was quite angry today.

445
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,510
Cheng acted on his own

446
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,660
without telling us.

447
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,110
But think about it from another perspective.

448
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,620
Everything he has done

449
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,090
is for the team, right?

450
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,440
The pressure has always been on him alone.

451
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,750
He's gotten used to bearing it by himself.

452
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,510
That's why he thinks

453
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,860
he must carry the game.

454
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,740
He doesn't trust us at all.

455
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,830
How are we

456
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,210
supposed to move forward together?

457
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,340
Sometimes,

458
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,610
I'd think

459
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,310
if we chose the wrong person from the beginning.

460
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,390
You mean Tong Yao?

461
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,630
I don't think so.

462
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,770
She has proven to be outstanding.

463
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,310
I'm not talking about her skills.

464
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,110
I'm talking about

465
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,350
her impact on the others.

466
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,290
The club always wanted big news.

467
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,610
Now, there's news all the time.

468
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,640
Tong Yao does have an impact on us,

469
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,120
but I think

470
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,420
she has made the whole team

471
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,890
and Cheng

472
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,170
better.

473
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,600
It's just...

474
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,200
they haven't realized it yet.

475
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,180
Cheng.

476
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,740
Cheng.

477
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,330
Cheng, does your hand still hurt?

478
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,680
Open the door.

479
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,560
I'll apply medicine for you.

480
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,420
Cheng.

481
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,090
Tong Yao,

482
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
I want to be alone.

483
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,070
Okay.

484
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,640
Open the door when you figure it out.

485
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,860
I'll be here with you.

486
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,470
Come on. Keep up.

487
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,030
Hurry! Destroy the turret!

488
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,800
Keep up!

489
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,960
Destroy the turret!

490
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,910
Let's end it! Hurry!

491
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,060
Let's end it!

492
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,630
Nice!

493
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,790
Guys.

494
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,190
-That was awesome.
-Yes.

495
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,690
Cheng.

496
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,560
When I first joined the team

497
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,580
and officially met you,

498
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,470
you locked me outside the door.

499
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,820
At that time, I was thinking,

500
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:25,860
"Oh, no.

501
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,480
The captain is so domineering.

502
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,320
What if we don't get along well in the future?

503
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,050
If I perform poorly in the future,

504
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,060
you'd scold me every day."

505
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,150
Later,

506
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,430
indeed,

507
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,550
you scolded me every day.

508
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,300
But somehow, I got used to it.

509
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,130
Because what you said is right.

510
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,310
Whether it was about

511
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,510
my poor skills or the fight.

512
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,300
It turns out

513
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,900
you were always right.

514
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,550
So,

515
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,030
I got used to it.

516
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,030
I got used to listening to you

517
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,180
and relying on you.

518
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,350
I thought you could do anything.

519
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,470
You've always been the captain of Team ZGDX

520
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,720
and one of the top three ADs in the world.

521
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,270
You're very strong.

522
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,430
It's like you can solve

523
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,290
everything on your own.

524
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,190
But

525
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,330
I still want to tell you this.

526
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,660
Although you are the captain,

527
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,800
you shouldn't protect everyone

528
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,870
like a hen protecting its chicks.

529
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,110
You are a human,

530
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,570
not a god.

531
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,470
There will always be things that are too heavy

532
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,400
for you to bear or solve on your own.

533
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,070
You said

534
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,580
you were worried you're no longer

535
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,410
the perfect man I admire.

536
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,110
That's not true.

537
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,800
I've seen you in cheap T-shirts

538
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,530
unshaven, and with uncut toenails,

539
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,580
but

540
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,870
in my heart,

541
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,150
you're still irreplaceable.

542
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,550
There's another thing

543
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,060
I didn't tell you.

544
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,950
It's about you announcing our relationship.

545
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,500
As your girlfriend,

546
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,590
I'm really touched.

547
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,230
Because you have proved you care about me

548
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,110
and love me regardless of

549
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,890
what others think.

550
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,030
I'm really happy.

551
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,130
You know what?

552
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,230
I'm very grateful that you

553
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,680
helped me find that girl

554
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,360
and uncover the truth.

555
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,550
Actually, Rui

556
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,410
secretly told me about the club's decision.

557
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,750
I told him it was okay.

558
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,870
We should think about the bigger picture.

559
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,570
I was mentally prepared to be scolded

560
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,700
and to apologize to everyone online.

561
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,190
Because lots of people told me

562
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,360
I'm a public figure.

563
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,640
When I enjoy the glory that comes with the spotlight,

564
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,440
I have to learn to endure the shadows behind it,

565
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,250
no matter how much unfairness

566
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,140
or criticism I face.

567
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
But you

568
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,290
gave me a different answer.

569
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,670
You told me

570
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,520
I don't have to put up with everything.

571
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,830
Because I have you.

572
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,400
God Ming.

573
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,860
You know what?

574
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,430
I'm upset.

575
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,090
I feel bad.

576
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,870
There is nothing I can do

577
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,870
to help with the current situation.

578
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,830
I know.

579
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,880
I know I'm just a butler.

580
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,430
A nanny.

581
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,730
But I still firmly believe...

582
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,440
I still firmly believe we can win the championship.

583
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,390
You know what?

584
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,770
I don't care about the pressure from the company.

585
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,690
I don't care about what others say about me either.

586
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,250
Do you know what I care about?

587
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,150
I care about you the most.

588
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,110
I care about you the most.

589
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,750
I don't want to lose any of you.

590
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,300
Do you understand?

591
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,790
Lu Sicheng,

592
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,510
if you still don't pull yourself together,

593
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,310
I would blame myself

594
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,960
and feel very guilty.

595
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,660
If Cat is disappointed and leaves

596
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,310
because of this,

597
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,290
I would think it's all my fault.

598
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,560
I have

599
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,110
very low emotional resilience.

600
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,310
I'm very sensitive.

601
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,250
If something really happens to the team

602
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,530
because of this,

603
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,570
I...

604
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Will you blame me?

605
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,230
Yes.

606
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,120
I might even fall apart.

607
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,460
And I'm very petty.

608
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,290
Maybe

609
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,870
I'll hate you forever.

610
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,239
I can imagine your expression even with the door between us.

611
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,750
In the past, I always thought

612
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,030
I could handle everything well

613
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,159
and I didn't care what others think.

614
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,170
What Cat said is right.

615
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,670
I was wrong.

616
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,590
I thought I could handle everything well.

617
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,450
I was wrong.

618
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,550
I'm not fearless.

619
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,530
I also have fears

620
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,800
and moments of hesitation.

621
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,790
I guess...

622
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,020
this day will come.

623
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,220
I need you guys.

624
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,080
I need you guys.

625
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,120
Let's meet at the training base at 2 p.m.

626
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,500
[Team ZGDX's Group]

627
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,160
About the ban and pick during the previous match,

628
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,080
I thoughtlessly picked Youko.

629
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,110
I changed God Ming's tactics

630
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,350
without discussing with you.

631
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,080
I was wrong.

632
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm sorry.

633
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,480
In future matches,

634
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,380
you don't need to indulge me again.

635
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,240
If I make any mistake,

636
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,310
just tell me.

637
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,540
I will fix it.

638
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,610
As the captain,

639
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,670
leaving the team without permission was indeed my fault.

640
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,270
I just hope you can give me some time so that I can

641
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,290
slowly learn to correct my issues

642
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,990
like being dictatorial,

643
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,010
overbearing,

644
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,140
egotistical,

645
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,030
and wilful.

646
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,310
The team is a collective.

647
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,430
I can't go solo,

648
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,920
and I certainly can't handle everything

649
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,030
on my own.

650
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,790
I admit

651
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,930
I need you guys.

652
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,670
I hope you can accept my apology.

653
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,540
From now on,

654
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,350
I hope we can face everything

655
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,810
together.

656
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,980
I'll do my best in the upcoming matches.

657
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,150
I'll train hard.

658
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,730
Team ZGDX

659
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,430
is not just my team.

660
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,110
It belongs to all of us.

661
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
I hope we can fight to the end,

662
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,790
with no regrets

663
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,270
and no complaints.

664
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,860
I'm sorry.

665
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,750
I apologize to you again for my egotism

666
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,730
and wilfulness.

667
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,490
Cheng,

668
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,150
I don't know why

669
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,240
I'm very scared right now.

670
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,790
Forget it.

671
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,180
Cheng,

672
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,590
I never expected to see you apologize in my lifetime.

673
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,770
My life is worth it. I have no regrets.

674
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,560
Cheng,

675
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,030
do you want to apologize to me

676
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,710
for getting me killed because you wanted to save your skills

677
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,580
and wouldn't heal me?

678
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,140
Pang, don't push your luck.

679
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,550
Let go of Cheng. Do you want to strangle him?

680
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,580
He should... apologize.

681
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Cat, stop pretending to be a statue.

682
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,780
Who said in the morning that Cheng

683
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,510
didn't send a message with his phone in his hands?

684
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,910
Cheng, you scared me.

685
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,360
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you.

686
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,560
I won't yell at you anymore, Cheng.

687
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,790
Stop crying.

688
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,390
I'm not crying.

689
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,840
You're not crying? Then I'm getting the short end of the stick.

690
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,570
Cheng would never cry.

691
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,190
Okay?

692
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,310
This is great.

693
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,060
Yeah.

694
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,940
A family should stay united.

695
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,890
Not a single one should be missing.

696
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,780
[Mrs. Lu]

697
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,840
Hello.

698
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,110
[Binhai Police Station]

699
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,340
-Hello. Let's go in.
-You're here.

700
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,340
Let's go.

701
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,630
Are you nervous?

702
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,130
Don't worry. I'm here. Let's go.

703
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,890
You all know the details.

704
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,870
I arranged the meeting today

705
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,410
to solve the problem.

706
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:27,820
Lin Mo

707
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,650
is the owner of the "Momo is the Devil" Weibo ID.

708
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,230
These two are her parents.

709
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,960
According to our investigation,

710
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,590
the package containing a razor blade

711
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,000
was indeed sent by Lin Mo.

712
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,740
Young people nowadays

713
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,920
are really reckless.

714
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,900
We handle similar cases,

715
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,270
involving prank deliveries,

716
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,070
about once or twice every month.

717
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,740
Have you had the injury examined?

718
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,800
Please take a look.

719
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,000
Typically, this kind of situation ends in a settlement.

720
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,020
She's young and immature after all.

721
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,540
She has been scolded.

722
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,770
I think she's quite scared.

723
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,150
She's learned her lesson.

724
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,640
I guess she won't dare to do it again.

725
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,400
Yes, yes.

726
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,330
She's young and immature.

727
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,230
My daughter is only 18 years old.

728
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,760
She is retaking the 12th grade this year,

729
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,830
preparing for Gaokao.

730
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:17,630
That's right.

731
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,520
We will discipline her well after we go back.

732
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,320
We will pay for all the medical expenses.

733
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,110
It's not good

734
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,970
to bring online problems into the real world.

735
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:28,480
Right?

736
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,210
And today, our daughter

737
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,030
cried all the way here.

738
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,250
We just called her out of school.

739
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,430
After she returns,

740
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,960
who knows what her classmates will say about her?

741
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,320
And her dad and I still have to work.

742
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,010
We don't accept a settlement.

743
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,140
Your daughter is 18 years old.

744
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,160
My girl is only in her early 20s.

745
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,120
If we let it go just because your daughter

746
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,270
is young and immature,

747
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,190
what about the physical

748
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,640
and emotional harm my girl has suffered?

749
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,520
She spread rumors online,

750
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,810
sent a razor blade,

751
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,320
and pretended to be pitiful online,

752
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,590
lying about committing suicide and having depression.

753
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,050
This incident has brought even more

754
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,780
insults and trouble to my girl.

755
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,330
How should we settle this?

756
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,360
So, we don't accept a settlement.

757
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:07,860
Apologize now.

758
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,200
I... I didn't mean it.

759
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,350
I was wrong.

760
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,630
I won't do it again.

761
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,730
Please forgive me.

762
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,140
Don't be nervous.

763
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,450
It wasn't a controlled blade.

764
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,150
Besides, spreading lies and rumors online will only

765
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,290
lead to a few days of detention.

766
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,640
You'll just get a record, be educated, and offer compensation

767
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,390
for mental damage.

768
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,950
It's no big deal.

769
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,010
It's just playing games online.

770
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,170
Is it that serious?

771
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,830
No.

772
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,840
How about this?

773
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,580
I'll break your daughter's arm

774
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,490
before her Gaokao.

775
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,630
It's not serious either, right?

776
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,790
After all, she can take the exam again next year.

777
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,050
How could you say that?

778
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,730
We didn't mean it.

779
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,400
Watch your manners.

780
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,440
This is the police station.

781
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,390
What nonsense are you talking about?

782
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,860
Yeah. What nonsense are you talking about?

783
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,190
I was talking about you.

784
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,450
We don't accept a settlement.

785
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:58,770
Let's go.

786
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,440
Why are you so unreasonable?

787
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,810
Why are they leaving?

788
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,090
Why are they leaving?

789
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:06,990
Officer,

790
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,780
if they don't accept a settlement,

791
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,240
will my daughter get a record?

792
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,940
Yeah.

793
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,810
If she has too many such records,

794
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,690
will it affect her chances of getting into college?

795
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,310
What does she mean by "too many such records"?

796
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,710
You pity that young girl?

797
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,990
I'm also a young girl.

798
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,740
You're the only girl in our team.

799
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,670
Detain?

800
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,430
How can you detain her?

801
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,680
She can't be detained even just for one day,

802
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,080
not to mention five days.

803
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,900
My daughter still needs to go to school.

804
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,340
It was fine last time.

805
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,000
How come she'll be detained this time?

806
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,600
It's clearly the same thing.

807
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,540
Madam,

808
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,160
watch your mouth.

809
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,870
As her mother,

810
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,690
you have failed to discipline her well.

811
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,720
When she's in trouble,

812
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,850
you think about how to avoid punishment and shirk responsibility first.

813
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,760
She has done

814
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,400
something like this before.

815
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,210
She wrote a threatening letter to someone three months ago,

816
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,580
just because that person complained about her idol.

817
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,510
Is that reasonable?

818
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,060
Well, what kind of threat

819
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,790
could a letter possibly pose?

820
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,350
What kind of threat could it pose?

821
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,280
You have no legal awareness at all.

822
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,740
You're worried your daughter will be detained.

823
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,370
Doesn't that person have parents?

824
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,360
Last time, they didn't hold you accountable after you paid the compensation,

825
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,820
but that doesn't mean she did nothing wrong.

826
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,470
Considering your attitude,

827
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,300
I don't think I can mediate any further.

828
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,960
Just go through the formal procedure from here.

829
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,470
Thank you.

830
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,400
Stay in touch.

831
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,960
This is not okay! This... This...

832
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,230
This is not okay! I don't believe it!

833
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,440
She'll... be detained?

834
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,470
How did it go?

835
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,630
I didn't expect

836
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,850
that this young girl

837
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,740
was sued before because she sent someone

838
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,730
a threatening letter.

839
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,330
This time,

840
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,150
I'm afraid she'll be detained.

841
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,300
According to Article 20 of the Public Security Administration Punishment Law,

842
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,390
if any of the following situations occur,

843
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,580
the punishment will be severe:

844
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,270
the person has been punished

845
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,950
under public security management within the last six months.

846
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:48,880
Article 42:

847
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,430
if any of the following situations occur,

848
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,790
the punishment will be detention

849
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,390
for up to five days or a fine of up to 500 yuan.

850
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,610
For more serious cases,

851
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,910
detention could range from five to ten days,

852
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,670
with a fine of up to 500 yuan as well.

853
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,470
1. Sending threatening letters

854
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,930
or using other methods

855
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,230
to endanger someone's personal safety.

856
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,480
She's already 18 years old.

857
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,040
She got a record within the last six months.

858
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,170
So, she should bear the consequences.

859
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,140
You Googled it and memorized it last night?

860
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,940
How did you know she's got a record?

861
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,870
How would I know?

862
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,090
Then how come you memorized it so well?

863
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,130
I graduated from China University of Political Science and Law.

864
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,170
Lu Yue told me before.

865
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,110
But I didn't believe him.

866
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,710
Am I good?

867
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,190
Our daughter is still young.

868
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:29,470
What... What should we do?

869
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,710
Enough. Stop it.

870
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,800
It's all your fault.

871
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,030
You always indulged her.

872
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,220
Why are you yelling at me?

873
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,430
Do something!

874
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,250
You've spoiled her.

875
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,710
Let's go. The show is over.

876
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,710
What should we do?

877
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:39,950
How would I know?

878
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,750
You are such a disappointment.

879
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,580
The ZGDX Esports Club solemnly states

880
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,870
that the owner of the Momo is the Devil Weibo ID

881
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,640
posted an article on the forum titled

882
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,430
How Schemer Tong Came Into Being

883
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,890
and sent a malicious package to Ms. Tong Yao,

884
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,030
resulting in her finger being cut.

885
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,620
The ZGDX Esports Club has been actively cooperating

886
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,530
with the police in their investigation and evidence collection.

887
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:04,950
The case has now been closed by the police.

888
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,840
We are now releasing the findings of the investigation as follows:

889
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,680
Momo is the Devil is an adult

890
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,520
and does not suffer from depression.

891
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,590
The claim of suicide is entirely unfounded.

892
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,980
To protect Ms. Tong Yao's legal rights,

893
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,130
the club hereby makes the following formal statement:

894
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,100
1. We request Momo is the Devil

895
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,540

896
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,100
and publicly apologize to Ms. Tong Yao.

897
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,130
2. We call on the relevant internet users and platforms

898
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,750

00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,140
and commenting on the false information.

900
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,870
Honey, what are you looking at?

901
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,240
Look.

902
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,690
Problem solved?

903
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,260
You know what? This is called karma.

904
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,960
No one can stay on a pedestal forever,

905
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,720
and no one will stay in the mire forever.

906
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,130
Love what you love boldly.

907
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,260
There's nothing wrong with that.

908
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:02,310
