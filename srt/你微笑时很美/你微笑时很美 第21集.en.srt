1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,530
A scumbag couple deserves each other.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,360
Mistress.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,310
He's a love rat. He's not worth it.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,310
Let it go, Guoguo.

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,060
Xu Tailun has been banned.

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,550
We'll never see him again,

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,810
thanks to you.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,880
You really are a vicious woman.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,930
Are you alright?

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,870
Did I ruin him with my own hands?

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,780
If you had known it would end up like this,

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,240
why would you have done it in the first place?

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Cheng, why are you here?

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
Why are you soaking wet?

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,220
Didn't they give you an umbrella?

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,560
I really disliked her at first.

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,670
But now I feel that

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,050
while she's hateful,

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,460
she also has the sadness of being a fan.

20
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,880
Whether it's Xu Tailun

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,080
or us,

22
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,250
if we disregard the feelings of those who like us

23
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,650
and do whatever we want,

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,680
we'll be exposed and destroyed.

25
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,140
When I think about this,

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,950
I feel that our circle

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,550
might not be worth liking.

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,840
It's not as bad as you think.

29
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,560
I don't know since when,

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,350
there's been a saying in your circle that goes,

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,950
"Esports doesn't believe in love."

32
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,450
Do you want to give it a try?

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,860
Give what a try?

34
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,560
Me.

35
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,890
But you're an exception.

36

[Episode 21]

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,520
Cheng.

39
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,890
Can you please not be so unpredictable?

40
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,820
I can't handle it if you joke about it again and again.

41
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,120
How many times do you have to play the same joke before it gets old?

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,050
Let me tell you,

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm not afraid this time.

44
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,020
Where are you going?

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,640
Sit back down.

46
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,160
Why?

47
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,750
What did I say to make you react like this?

48
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,170
Did I ask you to consummate our marriage right here?

49
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,570
You...

50
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,810
Don't talk nonsense.

51
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,600
Lu Sicheng, I'm telling you,

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,060
confessing your love to someone shouldn't be done with

53
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,840
this kind of tone and expression.

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,890
Even peacocks know to spread their feathers when courting.

55
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,090
How can you be like this?

56
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,690
Like what?

57
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,290
Fierce.

58
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,810
So if I'm gentler, you'll agree?

59
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:55,950
Look.

60
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,450
You're silent.

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,140
I really want to drag Jian Yang and Xu Tailun out

62
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,470
and give them a beating.

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,240
What does this have to do with them?

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,520
Go look in a mirror

65
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,470
and see how terrifying your expression was just now.

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,280
I wanted to wait a bit longer,

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,530
at least until we won a championship or something before telling you how I feel.

68
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,290
But now,

69
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,120
seeing your expression, I know I can't wait anymore.

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
If another guy like Xu Tailun comes along,

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,240
we won't even make it to the finals

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,370
before you've converted to Buddhism.

73
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,880
After all, there are quite a few scumbags in this circle.

74
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,560
Unlike me.

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,440
I'm a good guy.

76
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,210
How about we wait until

77
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,360
we win the national championship before we talk about this?

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,760
The time will be right, and the conditions will be favorable.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,930
I think this is a great idea.

80
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,990
It's time for you to take your medicine.

81
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,850
Do you have any principles at all?

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,720
Last time, when you asked me if I was characterized as

83
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,400
a fearless and perfect person,

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,930
I already told you I wasn't.

85
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,170
If the consequence of sticking to my principles

86
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,440
is watching the woman I love

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,390
run off to a nunnery to strike a wooden fish,

88
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,790
why should I do that?

89
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,330
To entrap myself?

90
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,090
So

91
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,440
I guess I was just flattering myself.

92
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,720
You never liked me.

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,040
Then why did you hide behind the chair

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,970
and speak like an abandoned puppy,

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,930
asking me not to meet my blind date?

96
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,050
So, am I being rejected?

97
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,500
I wouldn't dare.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,860
So, you agree to be my girlfriend?

99
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,070
Not exactly.

100
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,560
I see.

101
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
You simply want to be punched, don't you?

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,000
Look.

103
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,630
It's exactly this kind of tone.

104
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,630
The tone of a team captain,

105
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,310
a team bully, or a father.

106
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,370
Whatever tone it is,

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,659
it's just not the tone of a boyfriend.

108
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,190
I wasn't referring to you when I said boyfriend.

109
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,240
Why are you smirking?

110
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,250
Stop it.

111
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,060
Take it back...

112
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,270
Whether my tone sounds like a boyfriend's or not,

113
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,870
how would you know if you don't give me a chance?

114
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,800
Don't shake my hand like that.

115
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,160
An old man acting coy,

116
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
that's cheating.

117
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,120
Think about it.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,240
I'll give you two hours.

119
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,630
Give me an answer before 9 p.m.

120
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,490
Why 9 o'clock?

121
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,620
Because this determines

122
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,220
whether I can have a sound sleep tonight or not.

123
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,400
Dry your hair. Don't catch a cold.

124
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,060
We have an interview later.

125
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,390
Tong Yao, stay calm.

126
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,640
The two of them have no communication at all today.

127
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,650
Do you think they're having an internal conflict?

128
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,970
If that's really the case,

129
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,810
we won't even need to cover this interview.

130
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,760
This topic alone

131
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,170
is enough for us to write three whole pages.

132
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,930
Hello, everyone.

133
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,120
For the upcoming interview,

134
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
the guests we have here are

135
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,630
Chessman and Smiling from Team ZGDX.

136
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,850
Welcome, both of you.

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
The first question for you two is

138
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,340
about the recent issue of Korean players

139
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,410
playing in OPL.

140
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,140
What are your thoughts on this?

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,870
I think it can't be generalized.

142
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,680
There are also good Korean players,

143
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,510
such as the jungler of Team FNC,

144
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,650
the ADC of Team YQCB,

145
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,930
and some other Korean players in other teams.

146
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,170
It's treating the symptoms, not the cause.

147
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,440
It's a hasty approach.

148
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,940
Korean players indeed bring us

149
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,890
many new tactics and gameplay ideas

150
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,290
that are worth learning.

151
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,100
But to strengthen our league,

152
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,720
we can't rely too heavily on Korean players.

153
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,890
So what's the solution?

154
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,080
We've heard recently

155
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,580
that there's a small trend of boycotting Korean players in the circle.

156
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,720
We'd also like to ask you two

157
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,120
about your attitude towards this boycott.

158
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,530
A boycott might be going too far.

159
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,080
I think we should strengthen management.

160
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,630
It mainly depends on the clubs, I guess.

161
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,900
It all depends on self-discipline.

162
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,970
If there's no self-discipline, even the clubs can't manage it.

163
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,530
Also,

164
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,640
I want to emphasize one point here.

165
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,730
This has nothing to do with whether there are foreign players or not.

166
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,460
Domestic players also have this kind of problem.

167
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,950
The next question will be about

168
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,260
your views on the relationship between players and fans.

169
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,020
As we know,

170
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,060
player Xu Tailun has recently

171
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,390
been exposed by a female fan

172
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,740
who had an inappropriate relationship with him.

173
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,030
It's a delicate coexistence.

174
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,840
A moderate distance should be kept.

175
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,020
Someone who interferes in others' relationships,

176
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,850
whether it's the man or the woman,

177
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,290
is unforgivable.

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
And fans

179
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,310
should be clearly aware

180
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,840
whether you're viewing the players through rose-colored glasses

181
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,010
when thinking about the players you like.

182
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,880
From simple and pure admiration

183
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,950
to terrifying possessiveness,

184
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,200
it's a very scary

185
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,990
and discouraged behavior.

186
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,150
It seems that Smiling, as a girl,

187
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,160
has a different perspective

188
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,790
on this matter.

189
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,170
However, judging from your answers just now,

190
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,380
it seems to imply that the players in this industry

191
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,900
more or less have some

192
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,990
issues with their lifestyle, right?

193
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,700
Everyone in this industry is quite young.

194
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,290
Since they're exposed to society too early,

195
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,620
it's easy for the players to be misguided.

196
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,210
It's like when students first start school,

197
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,340
they often make their teachers angry.

198
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,580
I hope us players can have more self-restraint.

199
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,570
I don't know.

200
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,080
Anyway, there's nothing wrong with my lifestyle.

201
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,680
Moreover,

202
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,090
I am a man worthy of lifelong commitment.

203
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,090
So, facing the current situation of

204
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,890
light and darkness coexisting in the professional circle,

205
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,920
I'd like to ask both of you,

206
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,000
have you ever considered

207
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,060
dating someone within the industry?

208
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,470
Why not?

209
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Don't you want to?

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,760
I don't know.

211
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,050
Alright.

212
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,130
Today's interview is coming to an end.

213
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,120
We also want to thank all the media friends for your support.

214
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,720
Thank you.

215
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,420
Don't you think

216
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,810
there's something going on between Chessman and Smiling?

217
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,140
What do you mean by that?

218
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,450
Do you remember Chessman once said

219
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,110
he likes girls who are better at gaming than him?

220
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,360
Now that you mention it,

221
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,720
there does seem to be some clues.

222
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Right? Right?

223
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,320
After we go back,

224
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,010
let's quickly prepare all the materials.

225
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,250
As soon as they make an official announcement,

226
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,680
we can grab the headlines.

227
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,480
That's right.

228
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,810
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

229
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,480
I'll give you two hours.

230
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,420
Give me an answer before 9 p.m.

231
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,930
Which floor are you going to?

232
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,820
46.

233
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,690
This is you?

234
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,570
Why?

235
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,840
Taking the bullet

236
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,910
is something a man should do.

237
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,200
Actually, for me, Tamamonomae...

238
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,250
Is a kind of faith.

239
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,360
How about establishing a new faith

240
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,090
with the determination to win?

241
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,610
Let's go.

242
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,960
The whole world can tell that

243
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,440
you lost on purpose.

244
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,710
I don't want you to go.

245
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,050
Come on, Smiling.

246
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,530
I knew Chessman definitely likes you.

247
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,060
He must have let you win on purpose.

248
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,950
Do you remember that Chessman once said

249
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,750
he likes girls who are better at gaming than him?

250
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,750
Put on your slippers before eating.

251
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,360
Cheng.

252
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,800
One last question.

253
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,050
You've been ignoring me these past few days.

254
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,910
Was it only because you're angry?

255
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,580
Because I'm afraid.

256
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,900
Afraid that I'll be too softhearted.

257
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,700
It's now one minute and 30 seconds to 9 o'clock

258
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,160
Beijing time.

259
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,410
You're even announcing the time?

260
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,490
Your answer is?

261
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,330
I...

262
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,530
Think it through before you speak.

263
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,760
Is this...

264
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,080
Yes.

265
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,850
Although DQ.Five is a bit far,

266
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,840
I still managed to

267
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,370
bring the cat hostage back.

268
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,010
It's now 30 seconds to 9 o'clock Beijing time.

269
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,370
If I'm still single in 30 seconds,

270
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,210
I'll have to take this cat away.

271
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,440
Why aren't you hugging me back?

272
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,020
What are you looking at?

273
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,010
My cat and my girl.

274
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,310
Why can't I look?

275
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,960
Who's your girl?

276
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,440
What kind of hero threatens people with a cat?

277
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,610
All's fair in love and war.

278
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,760
If it weren't for this cat,

279
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,020
how could I have hugged you?

280
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,880
You scoundrel.

281
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,420
[Tong Yao]

282
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,320
Hey, sis.

283
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,320
Our Pancake has a little brother now.

284
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,450
Are you crazy?

285
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,080
Do you know how early it is?

286
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,880
Big news, sis.

287
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,410
I must tell you within 20 minutes.

288
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,040
Come quickly.

289
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,100
If you're a second late, I won't talk.

290
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,280
Okay, okay, got it.

291
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,640
Big news?

292
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,730
I smell gossip.

293
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,470
Let me put on some carrot-colored lipstick.

294
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,700
Is this the big news you wanted to tell me?

295
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,800
This cat looks a bit familiar.

296
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,470
I know what you want to ask.

297
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,690
I also know I have the right to remain silent.

298
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,990
But everything I say

299
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,080
will be used as evidence in court.

300
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,990
This is the cat

301
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,650
raised by that scumbag Xu Tailun

302
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,570
and his mistress fan.

303
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,720
Is that all?

304
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,690
Xu Tailun has been banned,

305
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,130
and he's not in the mood to keep the cat anymore.

306
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,330
So our captain

307
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,030
brought it over from DQ.Five.

308
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,360
I don't know if he paid for it or not.

309
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,960
It happened just last night.

310
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,570
I gave it a name,

311
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,420
Scallion.

312
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,830
Because it's also my cat now.

313
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,650
So here's the question.

314
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,710
Why would a cat have two owners?

315
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,580
The answer is...

316
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,470
Between the captain and me,

317
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,000
there's now an indescribable relationship.

318
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,920
What?

319
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,890
That's how it is.

320
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,160
What?

321
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,800
That's it.

322
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,010
Excuse me?

323
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,720
How? What?

324
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,010
You and who, Chessman?

325
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,580
Keep it down. No one else knows about this yet.

326
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,040
Well done, Mulan.

327
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,730
The enemy on the hill hasn't retreated yet,

328
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,800
and the esports empire is not yet unified,

329
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,880
but you've already slept with General Lu.

330
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,050
I haven't, I haven't.

331
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,650
I haven't had the chance yet.

332
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,210
You scheming girl.

333
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,830
You even look regretful.

334
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,230
Keep it down.

335
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,980
So

336
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,690
when do you plan to apply for your

337
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,550
Tsinghua postdoctoral program?

338
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,250
Do you hear that slapping sound in the air?

339
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,280
That's the sound of you being slapped in the face.

340
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,970
Actually, I didn't expect it either.

341
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,590
I really didn't expect it.

342
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,210
It just came up yesterday,

343
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,920
and our captain tricked me with the cat.

344
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,700
I couldn't resist at the moment, so I agreed.

345
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
But we're still in the trial period.

346
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
Our captain said,

347
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,920
"Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth."

348
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,880
What truth?

349
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,640
That he's a good man,

350
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,920
different from Xu Tailun and the others.

351
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,450
Something like that.

352
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,850
Can't you two just

353
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,570
date like normal people?

354
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,460
Being all mysterious is one thing,

355
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,050
and now you're doing some kind of experiment?

356
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,180
Can you return him if you're not satisfied?

357
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,200
Three-month trial,

358
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
five-year nationwide warranty.

359
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,830
Not bad. Not bad.

360
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,650
Well, make good use of your trial period.

361
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,230
So we can't meet for drinks. Next time then.

362
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,890
We can make an appointment for practice matches when we have time.

363
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,350
We don't have a curfew. Let's talk tomorrow morning.

364
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,230
Who are you talking to?

365
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,240
A normal social contact.

366
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:15,870
Who?

367
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,980
The AD of the neighboring team.

368
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,850
Pope?

369
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,130
You call him "normal social contact"?

370
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,250
You have no idea.

371
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,450
On the day Pope came to China,

372
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,500
some fans made the grand gesture of taking your light board, Chessman,

373
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,180
to welcome him at the airport.

374
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,480
What were you two talking about? You look so happy.

375
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,800
You don't read books, and you don't read the news.

376
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,920
After Xu Tailun's incident was exposed,

377
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,190
our interview yesterday stirred up another wave.

378
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,680
The current public opinion is that

379
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,430
in the national professional circle,

380
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,030
both foreign players and domestic players can't control themselves.

381
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,340
They're demanding the clubs to strengthen management.

382
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,370
I just asked Pope

383
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,260
if he wanted to have an old man's duel,

384
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,180
like drinking.

385
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,220
He said they had a curfew.

386
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,070
Their club's curfew is at 10 p.m.

387
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,880
After that, no going out is allowed,

388
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,590
unless there's a group activity organized by the higher-ups.

389
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,910
Otherwise, even if they starve, they can only order takeout.

390
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,030
Is that true?

391
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,320
Would it be overkill?

392
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,410
No wonder Ai Jia has been behaving himself lately

393
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,070
and not seeing Jinyang often.

394
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,220
Rui.

395
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,080
The neighboring team has already taken action.

396
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,330
We can't fall behind.

397
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,790
Why don't we have a curfew?

398
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,290
Our players are self-disciplined.

399
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,240
We don't need that.

400
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,440
Self-disciplined?

401
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,440
Just now, your AD

402
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,700
wanted to lure the AD from neighboring team out for drinks.

403
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,060
Let go.

404
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,170
Let go.

405
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,240
I won't.

406
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,290
Lu Sicheng, let go...

407
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,820
Tong Yao.

408
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Come and check if your cat is hungry.

409
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,310
Let me take a look.

410
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,990
Let...

411
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,280
Let go.

412
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,680
Lu Sicheng!

413
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,530
I won't.

414
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:50,990
Look.

415
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,680
Did you catch a cold?

416
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,360
Are you hungry?

417
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,760
Are you hungry?

418
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,860
Let me check your little tummy.

419
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,060
[Your hand]

420
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,370
Scallion.

421
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,480
Is it hungry?

422
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,810
Your hand is so soft.

423
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,890
You pervert.

424
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,860
Even a cat lives better than me.

425
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,100
Why?

426
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Even a cat can sleep with its wife.

427
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,350
Pancake is a eunuch.

428
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,650
Even a eunuch cat can sleep with its wife.

429
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,950
Scallion is also a male cat.

430
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,650
Even a eunuch cat

431
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,310
can sleep with its little eunuch cat wife.

432
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,940
While you only have the company of Onmyoji Arena.

433
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,510
Thanks to Xu Tailun,

434
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,600
OPL clubs

435
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,000
are all undergoing a comprehensive management shakeup.

436
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,240
Team YQCB took the lead in making the regulation

437
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,480
that players are prohibited from going out alone after 10 p.m.

438
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,940
It's almost like they're in jail.

439
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,080
Once the training base gate is closed at night,

440
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,360
the players may as well take mock college entrance exams.

441
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,000
Not to mention winning the championship,

442
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,680
in a few years, it'll be a piece of cake for them

443
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,560
to get into Tsinghua or Peking University.

444
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,440
It's not just about the Korean players.

445
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,320
It's mainly a matter of moral quality.

446
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,840
Not every player

447
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,610
sleeps with fans.

448
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,240
Isn't that mid laner of Team YQCB, Ai Jia,

449
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,670
a great example?

450
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,830
His girlfriend appears at the training base a lot.

451
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,660
She doesn't seem to be a staff member.

452
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,190
She's quite good-looking.

453
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,250
Looks like she was also once a fan, who later became his girlfriend.

454
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,830
I guess Ai Jia is providing for her.

455
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,490
It's all written out clearly.

456
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,720
[Have you seen the proof of the gossip about Ai Jia, Team YQCB's mid laner? Isn't this concrete proof that he slept with a fan?]

457
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,280
Oh my god.

458
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,860
Why did Jinyang get affected too?

459
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,740
He definitely slept with a fan.

460
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,130
At least the girl is pretty.

461
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,320
She has such long legs. No wonder.

462
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,450
She's wearing Chanel from head to toe.

463
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
Even her bags are limited editions.

464
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,890
One bag of hers could cover my food expenses for a year.

465
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,240
Ai Jia pinches pennies

466
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,070
just to provide for his unemployed girlfriend.

467
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,300
What a miserable man.

468
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,420
Jinyang, are you alright?

469
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,490
I got caught up in this drama.

470
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,400
You might get high blood pressure from it.

471
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,300
But I suggest you

472
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,030
not to stoop to the level of those in Esports Farm.

473
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,750
Women are really scary.

474
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,290
Luckily, Cheng is single.

475
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,710
I don't want some girl

476
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,330
to affect his professional performance.

477
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,980
Brothers and sisters, please be kind

478
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,240
and stay away from him.

479
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,260
What should I do?

480
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,450
This is the first time I feel that

481
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,760
announcing my normal and pure relationship to the public

482
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,560
is even harder than winning a world championship.

483
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,570
Sis, for professional esports players,

484
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,800
is it better to grow old alone?

485
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,440
Otherwise, if you date someone,

486
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,050
it's easy to push him or her into an abyss.

487
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,440
Let me tell you something.

488
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,840
You can eat whatever food you want.

489
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,370
At worst, it's just your life at stake.

490
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,280
But you can't say whatever you want.

491
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,800
This is ruining

492
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,610
an innocent boy's relationship and trying to make him single.

493
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,540
You're committing a sin, you know?

494
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,790
Alright, alright, stop nagging.

495
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,390
What's wrong with me having a girlfriend?

496
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,920
Even the keyboard I use for gaming was a gift from my girlfriend.

497
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,560
I've been dating my girlfriend for a long time,

498
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,850
since the city tournament.

499
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,710
Yes, right. I pursued her.

500
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,840
I pursued her.

501
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,240
Let me emphasize this.

502
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll say it three times because it's very important.

503
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,600
I was the one who pursued her.

504
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,310
You've found quite a few photos already.

505
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,600
Let me know when you see her look at me

506
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,380
with a glimmer of admiration in her eyes.

507
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,840
Tell me, and I'll go burn incense right away.

508
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,010
What's wrong with me having a girlfriend?

509
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,200
With or without her, we're still just avoiding relegation.

510
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,660
Stop stirring up trouble.

511
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,900
Avoiding relegation is so glorious, huh?

512
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,380
Why are you saying it out loud?

513
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,710
The neighboring team can hear you. Aren't you embarrassed?

514
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,080
Not even trying to avoid suspicion.

515
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,770
Sis, you're really something. Charging right into the storm.

516
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,240
Go play.

517
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,360
I want to sing "Wild Child" for you.

518
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,830
Her legs are long indeed.

519
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,800
I know you're very interested in me,

520
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,610
and you have a lot of problems with me.

521
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,670
I've also seen the sincere wishes under the Weibo post.

522
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,790
I want to make a response here.

523
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,520
The RV shoes are not knockoffs.

524
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,220
I, your so called "Sis", carried them back myself

525
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,950
pair by pair from various boutiques with these hardworking hands.

526
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,760
And

527
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,170
don't just focus on these trivial things.

528
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:35,930
Look at this.

529
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,110
This was the anniversary gift Ai Jia gave me

530
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,100
on Singles' Day last year.

531
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Are you happy now?

532
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,490
Are you satisfied?

533
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,670
From now on,

534
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,960
whether it's a mountain of knives, a sea of fire, or a bottomless abyss,

535
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,120
I will never look back.

536
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,600
You guys take your time.

537
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,590
Don't listen to her nonsense.

538
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,720
Do you know how much that car costs?

539
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,690
How could I possibly have that money?

540
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,130
I...

541
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,890
I can't afford it. How could I possibly have given it to her as a gift?

542
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,530
Really, it's true. I'm not lying to you.

543
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,290
Don't you know how much that car costs?

544
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,150
Go search it yourselves on Baidu.

545
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,310
I-I don't have that much money to give her, okay?

546
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,070
Others try to avoid trouble,

547
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,570
but not you. When you saw trouble coming,

548
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,350
you charged right in without hesitation.

549
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,930
You even took on the heavy responsibility of being the flag bearer,

550
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,050
putting yourself at the forefront of the trend

551
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,340
and leading the way yourself.

552
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,680
You're truly impressive, Sis.

553
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,890
Please call me Queen.

554
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,570
Are you asleep?

555
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,200
-No.
-Free kill.

556
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,430
We can fight them now.

557
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,560
Miss me?

558
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,730
Bro, only five minutes ago,

559
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,830
we were sitting side by side playing games, okay?

560
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,910
I miss you.

561
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,990
May I ask which role you're trying to play, He Shuhuan

562
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,560
or Hong Shixian?

563
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,960
I'm playing the role of the Fifth Prince.

564
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,240
Little Swallow, are you thirsty?

565
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,400
Fifth Prince, I'm alright. Not thirsty.

566
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,860
I just feel a bit nauseous.

567
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,490
I'll deliver a bottle of water to Tong Yao.

568
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,800
Hit him.

569
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,540
Wait a moment. Wait for me to come over.

570
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,490
What's this about?

571
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,180
I told them you asked me to get you a bottle of water.

572
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,040
You're quite clever, aren't you?

573
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,000
Did you miss me?

574
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,130
What's wrong?

575
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,840
Now everyone knows that

576
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,760
the OPL clubs

577
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,470
are going through a major reshuffle.

578
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,700
I heard that DQ.Five

579
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,880
has even replaced several people in their management team.

580
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,210
Isn't that a good thing?

581
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,730
What's good about it?

582
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,540
The situation is getting out of hand.

583
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,230
They're even interfering with players' normal dating lives,

584
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,370
saying things like my Jinyang is completely dependent on Ai Jia,

585
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,620
and she's always hanging around the training base,

586
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,800
affecting Ai Jia's training.

587
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,510
They're even calling her a vixen.

588
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,560
Doesn't your friend drive a Porsche?

589
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,840
How long would it take Ai Jia to save up enough money

590
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,650
to buy her one?

591
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,160
But they don't know that.

592
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,960
Why are you mad at me for something they don't know?

593
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,770
Come on.

594
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,320
Look at this.

595
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,140
Women are so scary.

596
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,900
Fortunately, Cheng is single.

597
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,810
I don't want some girl

598
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,490
to affect his professional performance.

599
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,460
Brothers and sisters, please be kind

600
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,720
and stay away from him.

601
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,540
You know that fans' comments don't represent the player himself, right?

602
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,960
It's not fair to me if you take this seriously.

603
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
I know.

604
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,060
But

605
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,670
maybe you should keep your image

606
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,430
as a single boy who only knows how to play games.

607
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,100
Once you start dating,

608
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,330
you'll no longer be the dream of thousands of girls.

609
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,680
I refuse.

610
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,200
What do you mean you refuse?

611
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,860
Why do I feel that dating you

612
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,810
is even harder than reaching the sky?

613
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,280
We don't have to make it public if that's the issue.

614
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,940
Isn't it good the way it is now?

615
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,120
I won't force you.

616
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,290
Really?

617
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,070
Sure.

618
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,480
After all, I was the one who broke the rules first.

619
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,640
Come to think of it, given your position,

620
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,840
you probably need to avoid this kind of attention more than I do.

621
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,900
But this doesn't mean I'll regret it.

622
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,850
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

623
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,960
I took the initiative to approach you.

624
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,200
I'll be responsible for you till the end.

625
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,040
At most, you're just an accomplice.

626
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,600
How am I an accomplice?

627
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,990
You play games well,

628
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,640
and your professional attitude is excessively serious and adorable.

629
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,700
Your behavior seriously tempted me.

630
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,200
What?

631
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,170
I want to commit a crime.

632
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,040
Want a duel?

633
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,020
The kind that lasts all night.

634
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,030
What are you talking about?

635
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,750
Get out.

636
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,960
Tong Yao.

637
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,800
Get out.

638
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,840
Go to bed early.

639
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,500
It took you so long to deliver water?

640
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,730
She fell asleep right after sending the WeChat message.

641
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,730
I knocked on the door for quite a while before she opened it.

642
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,610
How dare she.

643
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,909
Making our captain deliver water to her.

644
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,739
Yeah, I wonder who spoiled her like this.

645
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,199
She really has some nerve.

646
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,170
[2020 OPL National League
Group B Round-Robin, Match 2]

647
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,190
Action.

648
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,010
Isn't this Smiling?

649
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,120
You're Smiling, right?

650
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,570
The venue is so remote.

651
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,290
It must have been tiring for you to come all the way here.

652
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:08,760
Not at all, not at all.

653
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,490
Aren't you playing today, Sis?

654
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,170
We're playing in the second match.

655
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,600
I came specifically to watch Team YQCB play.

656
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,660
After all, they're our strongest opponents right now.

657
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,690
I just saw

658
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,170
someone put Cheng and Pope's light boards

659
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,250
together.

660
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,350
It's a bit out of line, you guys.

661
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,480
It's obvious what you're trying to do.

662
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,930
Can you sign for me?

663
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:28,770
Sure.

664
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:29,880
Okay, thank you.

665
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,640
Can I take a photo with you?

666
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,850
Of course.

667
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,280
But when you post it,

668
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,450
don't just photoshop yourself.

669
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,010
Okay.

670
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,700
Thank you.

671
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,800
Thank you.

672
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,610
Smiling, can I take a picture with you?

673
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,110
Look.

674
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,210
-So pretty.
-Here.

675
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,690
Thank you.

676
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,310
Why are you here?

677
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,540
To watch the match.

678
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,610
So enthusiastic?

679
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,740
I've made up my mind.

680
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,540
As long as Ai Jia is playing,

681
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,250
I'll definitely come if I have time.

682
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,230
Not only will I come,

683
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,830
but I'll sit in the front row.

684
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,970
I want to show those skeptics

685
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,830
just how long my legs really are.

686
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,460
You're never going to let this joke go, are you?

687
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,080
Patience leads to great things.

688
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,210
The more I back down, the angrier I get.

689
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,560
Isn't that Chen Jinyang, Ai Jia's girlfriend?

690
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,800
At this critical moment,

691
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,110
she still dares to come.

692
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,110
Isn't she afraid it will affect Ai Jia's performance?

693
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,730
Don't worry. I got your back.

694
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,710
Shut up. What can you possibly protect me from?

695
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,440
Oh, it's you.

696
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Yes, it's me.

697
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,790
Look.

698
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,900
What a surprise.

699
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,890
I never expected

700
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,950
that the famous Smiling

701
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,230
would be right here with us.

702
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,010
And you even helped us confront those

703
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,380
misogynistic guys.

704
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,660
I was thinking at the time

705
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,160
who that cool girl was.

706
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,390
I almost became her fan.

707
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,010
Yes. Yes.

708
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,060
It occurred to us that

709
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,160
back then, we didn't cherish

710
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,690
the time you were sitting next to us.

711
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,620
We didn't expect the chance to make up for it would come so soon.

712
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,680
Exactly, exactly.

713
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,350
Smiling, here.

714
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,100
It's also free this time.

715
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,040
I'll always support you.

716
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,560
My physical senses were right! I do have fans.

717
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,390
I'm getting carried away.

718
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,300
It's great that you both decided to stay.

719
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,100
We've found a player worth following and liking,

720
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,300
so we decided to stay.

721
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
You two talk.

722
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,960
We'll go distribute these in the back.

723
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,610
Bye-bye.

724
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,020
Let's go. Bye-bye.

725
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,930
You've seen it all, Sis.

726
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,490
Let me tell you a joke,

727
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,990
"You got my back."

728
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,140
Having fans makes me cocky.

729
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,320
Grinning like an idiot.

730
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,710
I met some fans in the front row.

731
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,270
So many of them.

732
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,640
There were even my fans.

733
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,140
A girl who was going to quit the fanbase

734
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,570
ended up coming back because of me.

735
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,530
She was wearing my wristband.

736
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,930
I couldn't believe it at first,

737
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,490
but she really came back because of me.

738
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,820
I took photos with them.

739
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,240
I saw.

740
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,440
You're just brushing me off.

741
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,040
What did you see? As if you really saw anything.

742
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,300
Look up.

743
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,510
Your husband is here.

744
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,020
He's so worried about you

745
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,900
that he came over specially to keep an eye on you.

746
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,980
How thoughtful.

747
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,170
Unlike that stupid boyfriend of mine.

748
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,510
All he knows is sitting there and chatting with his teammates.

749
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,720
Look.

750
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,080
It's Cheng.

751
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,950
It really is a two-for-one deal.

752
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,500
Lu Sicheng!

753
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,730
He's so handsome.

754
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,450
We really lucked out today.

755
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,520
I saw you.

756
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,430
I've waved at you. If you still couldn't see me, there must be something wrong with you.

757
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,430
Are you blind?

758
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,850
Watch your language.

759
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
I'm going inside.

760
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,940
Don't start jumping about the moment I take my eyes off you,

761
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,070
and no flirting.

762
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,430
Not even with women.
