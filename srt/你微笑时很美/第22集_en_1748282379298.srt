1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The time in Beijing is 8.58 minutes and 30 minutes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Your answer is?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
X-Ti, Simei.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Don't let him know.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Don't let him know.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can you two

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
have a normal relationship?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't want to.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Can you have a normal relationship?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My god.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why did the fire go to Jingyang?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
From now on,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
no matter it's the mountains or the sea,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
or the abyss,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I will never go back.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to give Cibi a break.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Or I can sleep with her.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want to give Cibi a break.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Or I can sleep with her.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Or I can sleep with her.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Or I can sleep with her.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to give Cibi a break.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Or I can sleep with her.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Or I can sleep with her.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Or I can sleep with her.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or I can sleep with her.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Or I can sleep with her.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Or I can sleep with her.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Or I can sleep with her.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Or I can sleep with her.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Or I can sleep with her.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Or I can sleep with her.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Or I can sleep with her.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Or I can sleep with her.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Or I can sleep with her.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Or I can sleep with her.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Or I can sleep with her.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Or I can sleep with her.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Or I can sleep with her.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Or I can sleep with her.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Or I can sleep with her.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Or I can sleep with her.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Or I can sleep with her.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Or I can sleep with her.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Or I can sleep with her.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can sleep with her.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Or I can sleep with her.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We saw that YQCB's top duo, Rong Rong,

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
chose to be the Gold房 owner.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And they used the Golden Thread.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Mid Team was in love with the Swing.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And the AD team also chose to hold their hands to help Liang Sheng.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They used Gouyi's skin color.

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Liang Sheng is here.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Liang Sheng is here.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The game has begun.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
YQCB has pushed the second half of the second half of the second half.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Liang Sheng is here.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Liang Sheng is here.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,560
They're about to open the game so soon?

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,640
You're right.

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,200
Look, they're fighting.

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,320
Wow, they're really fighting.

64
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,800
Look.

65
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,240
They're fighting.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,320
Liang Sheng, help me.

67
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,280
I'll help you.

68
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
But the second-hand club's assistant

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
has to come and support them.

70
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,920
Look.

71
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,560
Liang Sheng is opening the game

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
in front of the Emperor.

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,640
I'm coming.

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,120
That's right.

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,520
Look.

76
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
I'm here to support them.

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,360
Before the Emperor is born,

78
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,520
I'll be the first to give them a chance

79
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,800
to show off their skills.

80
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,280
The Emperor is successful.

81
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,920
Good job.

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,400
The Emperor is really

83
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
a tough one to win.

84
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,440
The operation of the Ai family

85
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,720
is really good.

86
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,360
Why is the camera

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,600
so big in the Ai family?

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,080
He's been

89
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
in a bad mood these days.

90
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
He's got a big headache.

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,160
Okay.

92
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,120
Six, six, six.

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,160
My sister.

94
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,080
I've been doing the operation of the Ai family.

95
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,480
I've made a wish for her.

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,800
Can you be more nervous?

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,080
The game is over.

98
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,160
You're going to be in trouble.

99
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
I don't understand.

100
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,200
You don't understand?

101
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,440
Why are you sitting here?

102
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,520
He He,

103
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,160
look at the whole team

104
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,480
of YQCB.

105
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,920
It's so easy.

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,880
It seems like they have a full strategy.

107
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,120
That's right.

108
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,920
It's more obvious

109
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,200
to see the advantages of YQCB.

110
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,040
The cotton flower is here.

111
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,400
Hurry up.

112
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,160
It's time to play.

113
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,920
The cotton flower of Ai family

114
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,640
is the most popular

115
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,600
in the mountain.

116
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,480
Then the horse will be

117
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,440
more handsome than the beast.

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,040
That's great.

119
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
I didn't expect this move.

120
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,800
The second-hand shooter

121
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
didn't react at all.

122
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,720
The YQCB

123
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,440
is very strong.

124
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,360
That's right.

125
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,680
It's the chance

126
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,880
of YQCB

127
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,520
to win the game.

128
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,640
Nice.

129
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
Go, go, go.

130
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
Go, go, go.

131
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
Go, go, go.

132
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
Go, go, go.

133
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,440
I don't know if you've noticed.

134
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,000
Go, go, go.

135
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,960
Look, after the call,

136
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,760
after YQCB came,

137
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
they changed their strategy.

138
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,080
What do you want?

139
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,640
Here it comes.

140
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,120
Go, go, go.

141
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,080
YQCB

142
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,880
is very likely

143
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
to win the championship this year.

144
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,640
Don't fight.

145
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,440
Go, go, go.

146
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Go, go, go.

147
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,840
Go, go, go.

148
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,880
The god of defense is sealed.

149
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,440
Nice.

150
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Go, go, go.

151
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
The friend is calling again.

152
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,280
The tower seems to be pushing.

153
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,000
The Bianhua Open Team

154
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
is doing really well.

155
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,040
Look, the ball is falling to the ground.

156
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,560
It's falling to the ground.

157
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,280
It's falling to the ground.

158
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,000
Go, go, go.

159
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,920
It's really falling to the ground.

160
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,400
It's too late.

161
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,840
Nice.

162
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,360
Nice.

163
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
Wow, it's falling.

164
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,960
The first-hand shooter

165
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,080
won the championship.

166
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,520
Nice.

167
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
Nice.

168
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
Nice.

169
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,640
It's really amazing.

170
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
Congratulations.

171
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
It's really amazing.

172
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,880
This is really beautiful.

173
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,520
YQCB really

174
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,360
is very busy

175
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,240
in this season.

176
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,880
That's right.

177
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
It seems that in a few months,

178
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,240
their chemistry

179
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,720
has been very tacit.

180
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,680
Not only did the coach find

181
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,920
the support of his team,

182
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,720
but also the way

183
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:31,800
the team loved each other

184
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
has changed.

185
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,920
Yes.

186
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
The team loved each other

187
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,320
is really in the open.

188
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
The rhythm of this game

189
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
is very good.

190
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
Can you be serious?

191
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,720
This is the moment

192
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,800
when your boyfriend is high.

193
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
Look at your fans.

194
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,480
They are so excited.

195
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,920
What are you talking about?

196
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
You don't know that.

197
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,520
When I met this little ghost,

198
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,440
he is still a little boy.

199
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm not with him.

200
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,400
I'm sorry.

201
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,840
It's not intentional.

202
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,680
What are you doing?

203
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,440
What's wrong with me?

204
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,520
Some people

205
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,280
are just so-called monsters.

206
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
They don't understand the game.

207
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
They won't play it.

208
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,800
It's because of the celebrity smile

209
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,000
of the player.

210
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,760
They are so kind.

211
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,520
Shh.

212
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,360
Be quiet.

213
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,840
Isn't his girlfriend...

214
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm not talking about her.

215
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,240
The girl's reputation

216
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
is not because of this kind of person.

217
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,360
She is being reduced.

218
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
Look at Xu Tai Lun.

219
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
And Guo Guo.

220
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,640
It's good that the player likes to

221
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,400
watch them play the game.

222
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Why do they have to

223
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,760
seduce them?

224
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,160
You are right.

225
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Let's talk about the report.

226
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Let's talk about the game.

227
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,680
Look at that fool.

228
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,560
I played the game

229
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,360
with my fans on the stage.

230
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,320
What's going on?

231
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,560
But they can't tell us that.

232
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,520
It's okay. Don't think too much.

233
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,000
The second game officially begins.

234
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,280
The score is 1 to 0.

235
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,840
VQCB is leading the game.

236
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,320
Okay.

237
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,640
The B.B. game is over.

238
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,440
Both teams have confirmed it.

239
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
We can see that

240
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,160
the second game is

241
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
with two hands.

242
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,960
Xiao Xiu's hand.

243
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,200
Di An Hua's waist.

244
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,480
Gui Li's hand.

245
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
They didn't use

246
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,360
the game book with the game book.

247
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,960
VQCB chose

248
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,000
the game book with the game book.

249
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
The player used the game book.

250
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,040
It's obvious.

251
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,440
The game book is for

252
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,800
the white wolf.

253
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,240
They might want to try the game book.

254
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,920
But I think

255
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,400
they don't know

256
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,040
how to play the game.

257
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,840
Plus,

258
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
the game book with the game book

259
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,000
with the game book.

260
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
It's not a game book.

261
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,960
Once you see

262
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,280
the other team's strategy,

263
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
the game will be ruined.

264
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,840
The game book with the game book.

265
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,080
The game book can do little.

266
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,440
But the game book

267
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,040
can be considered as a world-class game.

268
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,080
The game is fast.

269
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,800
Look.

270
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,960
We can see it.

271
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
The game book with the game book

272
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,520
is ready to go.

273
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,760
It's a sudden attack.

274
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,120
That's right.

275
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,360
But the game book

276
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
seems to be not here.

277
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,120
It's not here.

278
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
We can fight.

279
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,880
Come on.

280
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,920
Go.

281
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Look at the current team.

282
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
The white wolf

283
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,280
seems to be worried about the game.

284
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,520
It's not long.

285
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,880
Now we can see

286
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,840
the game book with the game book

287
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
is for the game book.

288
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,360
The game book is ready.

289
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
It's a world-class game.

290
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240
The player used the game book

291
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,960
to go back to the game book.

292
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,400
It's a 10-minute walk.

293
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,760
Do you want to come to the bottom?

294
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,440
Be careful.

295
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,960
I'm not afraid.

296
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sure I've said it.

297
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,320
Look.

298
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,200
The game book

299
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
is not here.

300
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,120
It's a fake game book.

301
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not here.

302
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,640
The game book has been changed.

303
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,720
It's not here.

304
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,400
The game book is a mess.

305
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
The game book

306
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,640
is back to the game book.

307
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,160
The game book

308
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,480
is the same as the previous game.

309
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
It's a game book.

310
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,760
It's a game book.

311
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,200
It's a game book.

312
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,000
The next step is to pick the top

313
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
and catch the top.

314
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,680
Or you can draw a new one with 10 points.

315
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,520
The data shows

316
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,440
that they have a higher chance

317
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,240
of catching the top.

318
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,880
Rong Rong and Li Meng

319
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,960
have not come to the bottom

320
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,200
on the way to the home.

321
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
They were beaten by the second half.

322
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Lan Jie.

323
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,240
They just chased them.

324
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,200
Five minutes.

325
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,680
Five minutes.

326
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,960
Five people just sent me.

327
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,280
Two people in the lower lane

328
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
are not even six.

329
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
YQCB is the best.

330
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,240
It seems that the game book

331
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
is not good enough

332
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,400
for the four-game strategy.

333
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
But Brother Cheng and the Emperor

334
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,520
are really good at it.

335
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,640
No matter what the strategy is,

336
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
we should go up first.

337
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,400
But

338
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,360
the Emperor is more aggressive

339
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,080
than Brother Cheng.

340
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,520
The Emperor is a little bit

341
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
out of his mind.

342
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,400
Zhou Luo is not

343
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,840
able to get a girl.

344
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,640
To be honest,

345
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,400
I don't understand

346
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
why he wants to get a girl.

347
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,360
He can get a girl

348
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,200
who is more aggressive than this.

349
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,080
Yes.

350
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,640
Sometimes,

351
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:49,840
you can't

352
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,560
take the basic thing.

353
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,040
If you are a man,

354
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,760
you will be the opponent.

355
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,440
We can't quá

356
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,640
that the Emperor can handle it.

357
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
Go up.

358
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,280
Come on.

359
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,480
I'm really satisfied

360
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
by this kill.

361
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,520
Never be beaten in an average-izersi.

362
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,840
The Sky King has no space to travel.

363
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,160
But you are too ahead of us today.

364
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
Then come over here to save us.

365
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
Back home. Back home.

366
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,400
After those у others stand up,

367
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,720
the kicking on their nonprofits

368
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,400
felt bad that they couldn't catch up with us their mug��

369
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:43,060
May you have winning

370
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,480
We are profit

371
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
Our bet louder

372
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,040
Let's see

373
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,520
Our nous

374
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
Congratulations to Director Zhang!

375
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,820
Congratulations!

376
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,820
Congratulations!

377
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Congratulations!

378
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,620
Congratulations!

379
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,720
Congratulations!

380
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,720
Congratulations!

381
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,720
Congratulations!

382
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,020
Congratulations!

383
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,720
Congratulations!

384
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,920
You've lost a game of the game.

385
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,640
What?

386
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,240
You've lost a game?

387
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,160
What's the matter?

388
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,400
You've lost a game.

389
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,800
You haven't lost a game.

390
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,400
You haven't won a game.

391
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,920
You can't accept it.

392
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,280
You can't accept it.

393
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,040
Do you have the next game?

394
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
You can't win the game later.

395
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,400
What are you doing?

396
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,560
What does he mean?

397
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,800
What does it mean?

398
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,160
What does it mean?

399
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,640
Yes.

400
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,400
Because you're the one

401
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,920
who will win the game.

402
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,000
We came here

403
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
to see the game.

404
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,080
Please don't say

405
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,840
such annoying words.

406
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,400
Ai Jia.

407
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,360
Ai Jia.

408
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,960
My friend means

409
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,720
not...

410
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Go.

411
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,880
What are you doing?

412
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,560
Go.

413
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,200
Why are you like this?

414
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,640
No.

415
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,400
What kind of person is he?

416
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,280
I'm your fan.

417
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,400
You're right.

418
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,560
I can't bear to say

419
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
what I'm like.

420
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,520
Why are you so quiet?

421
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,400
What's the matter

422
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,640
with him?

423
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,560
What's the matter?

424
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,400
Come with me.

425
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,600
Let's go.

426
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,440
So cool.

427
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
So cool.

428
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
So cool.

429
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
So cool.

430
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
So cool.

431
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
So cool.

432
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
So cool.

433
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
So cool.

434
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
So cool.

435
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Let me down.

436
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Are you crazy?

437
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Why did you jump from the platform?

438
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
I saw it.

439
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
What else?

440
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
I can do anything for you.

441
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Why do you want to do anything?

442
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Let me tell you.

443
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I've been on fire for several days.

444
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I did it for myself.

445
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I did it for my love.

446
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I did it for my own sake.

447
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I just don't care

448
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
if they're dirty like you.

449
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
If they're willing to do it,

450
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
I'll do it with them.

451
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I don't care about them.

452
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Why do I keep being ugly?

453
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I'm afraid of making up girls.

454
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't want them to know

455
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
that we're bullying them.

456
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
And they still

457
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
try to protect

458
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
my personal reputation.

459
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Can I bear it?

460
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Why do you want it?

461
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
We owe them.

462
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Why do they want it?

463
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Are you a fool?

464
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I can't eat meat

465
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
if I'm scolded by his mother.

466
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Fool, are you naive?

467
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm naive.

468
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I told you

469
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
that no matter it's

470
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
the mountains, the sea,

471
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
or the abyss,

472
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I'll be burned by your eyes.

473
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I didn't understand

474
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
your dream at first.

475
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
But since I came back,

476
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I've been watching you

477
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
from the beginning of the competition.

478
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Although I still don't know

479
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
what to do

480
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
and what to do,

481
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
it's Yue.

482
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
No matter what,

483
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
I know

484
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
that at least

485
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
you won't leave

486
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
the stage of the movie theater

487
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
for the rest of your life.

488
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
I know

489
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
that you can't leave me

490
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
for the rest of your life.

491
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
So,

492
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I won't let you

493
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
choose a mother-in-law

494
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
between the movie theater

495
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
and your girlfriend.

496
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Since you've made your decision,

497
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
I won't regret it.

498
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I can't bear

499
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
to take this little thing.

500
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
How can I be in love with you?

501
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Isn't it just

502
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
to accept

503
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
these attention and point of view

504
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
with people like you?

505
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Who called my boyfriend

506
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
so capable

507
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
to be a little star?

508
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
They can be blessed

509
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
or not.

510
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Our future

511
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
has nothing to do

512
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
with them.

513
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
I'm not kidding.

514
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Whether it's the mountains and the sea,

515
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
or the garden of the Wanzhang,

516
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
I'm...

517
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
It's not easy.

518
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
It's quite hard to get a job.

519
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Why are these plums

520
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
so strange?

521
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm not sure.

522
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm not sure.

523
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Why are these plums

524
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
so strange again?

525
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
What the hell is love?

526
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Is it a competition or a...

527
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
I believe

528
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
that girl is a flower.

529
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
She's a high-ranking

530
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
and a good-looking girl.

531
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
She's a high-ranking and a good-looking girl.

532
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
She's a high-ranking and a good-looking girl.

533
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
What are you thinking?

534
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I didn't do anything.

535
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
She just said something loud.

536
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
She won't be banned,

537
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
won't be punished, right?

538
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Qingyang didn't do anything.

539
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
She usually

540
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
can't eat at all.

541
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
To celebrate the love competition,

542
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
she was in a bad mood.

543
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
What else?

544
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
She was just

545
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
just a simple love affair.

546
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
How could there be

547
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
so many reasons?

548
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
How could there be

549
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
so many tricks?

550
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
If you really like someone,

551
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
who will care about

552
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
the person you like?

553
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Is it the player

554
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
or the star who shines?

555
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
It's just the simple likes.

556
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
The player is also a person.

557
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
There will be someone

558
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
who likes him,

559
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
and the person who wants

560
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
to be with him.

561
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
What's wrong with that?

562
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Or is it that

563
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
such an idea

564
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
is wrong?

565
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Because as a public figure,

566
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
your body is not

567
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
able to attract yourself.

568
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
What we have

569
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
is to win the competition,

570
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
to get the fans,

571
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
to be the team's smile.

572
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
So we will do

573
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
more than that.

574
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
These things seem right.

575
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Of course,

576
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
there will be many people

577
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
who think so.

578
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
But if the player

579
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
is also so popular,

580
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
then it's wrong.

581
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
The sound of the competition is very important.

582
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
But compared to the fans,

583
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
for the satisfaction of the fans,

584
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
we should face

585
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
the people who are not.

586
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
So to be selfish,

587
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
this is our thing.

588
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you for your love and support.

589
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
But the sound of the competition

590
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
seems to be really

591
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
unrelated to you.

592
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
This is only the right way.

593
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
You are too rational.

594
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
But I can't.

595
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I can't.

596
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
I will be affected.

597
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
My heart will be too excited.

598
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I will be sad.

599
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I will be sad.

600
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
People will all know that.

601
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
But you don't seem to know that.

602
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Brother Cheng,

603
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
are you really

604
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
strong to the point of no danger?

605
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Yes.

606
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Because I still have to protect you.

607
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Forget it.

608
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I will tell you later.

609
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
What is the situation

610
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
that you are going to come

611
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
on a day like this?

612
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I thought that

613
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
such a good brother and father

614
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
would not belong to me

615
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
in the world.

616
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
It's a pity that

617
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
the next team

618
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
lost this game.

619
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Luckily, they won the game.

620
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
It's such a big game.

621
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
What strategy

622
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
will we have later?

623
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
God of the Gods,

624
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I have an unambitious idea.

625
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Can you use the Four-Touching One again?

626
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Four-Touching One?

627
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Use it.

628
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
No reason.

629
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
The four-touching one

630
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
is very competitive.

631
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Everyone said

632
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
the team

633
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
that is directly

634
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
in this game

635
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
can't win.

636
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
But the one we used

637
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
in the second game of DQ5

638
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
last time

639
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
is the four-touching one.

640
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
It's pretty good.

641
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
So I want to try it again.

642
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
See if I can use it.

643
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I have something to say.

644
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
It's a simple

645
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
and accurate

646
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
strategy.

647
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
You want to take the snowman.

648
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Snowman?

649
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Didn't Ai Jia

650
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
take the snowman just now?

651
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
She lost.

652
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
The game

653
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
is not related

654
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
to the snowman

655
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
or Ai Jia.

656
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
The most important thing

657
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
in the Four-Touching One is ADC.

658
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Feng Yang,

659
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
do you have any suspicion

660
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
about the four-touching one?

661
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
It's a big team.

662
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
It's not for

663
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
your own good sister.

664
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
It's not about

665
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
whether they lose the game

666
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
or if there are any girls

667
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
in the family.

668
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
It's fine.

669
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
No matter what

670
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
the one who doesn't win the game

671
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
will be able

672
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
to win the game.

673
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
The biggest

674
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
problem

675
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
they lost in the game

676
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
is in her.

677
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
It's better to let her

678
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
see what

679
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
the real Four-Touching One is.

680
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
But it may not

681
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
be a good thing

682
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
in the next two or three days.

683
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
So I agree.

684
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Okay, okay.

685
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Okay.

686
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I'll take a picture of the snowman

687
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
and

688
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
let's dream about the spring game.

689
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
You can't use

690
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
the four-touching one

691
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
or the four-touching one.

692
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
You're really arrogant.

693
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Why did I

694
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
have such a mess?

695
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
You're also a mess.

696
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Take a picture of the snowman.

697
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Ask.

698
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
The old cat is right.

699
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Take a picture of the snowman later.

700
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
You go to help the old cat.

701
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I'll take care of it.

702
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Dream about the spring game.

703
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
The spring game.

704
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Dream about the spring game.

705
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Meng Yao.

706
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Are you sure?

707
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
The snowman is falling.

708
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
It's snowing.

709
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Okay, now the ten players

710
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
in the game have chosen

711
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
their own four-touching one.

712
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Let's see

713
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
the final four-touching one.

714
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
The top-ranked cat

715
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
of ZGDX

716
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
is the black-touch one.

717
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
The one who chose K

718
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
is the purple-touch one.

719
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
The middle-ranked one

720
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
is the snowman.

721
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
The one who chose Chaseman

722
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
is the white-touch one.

723
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
The one who chose White Wolf.

724
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
The one who chose White Wolf.

725
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
The one who chose White Wolf

726
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
is the ninth-ranked one in the game.

727
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
The one who chose White Wolf

728
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
is the white-touch one.

729
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
The one who chose White Wolf

730
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
is the white-touch one.

731
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
The one who chose White Wolf

732
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
is the white-touch one.

733
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
What's your opinion

734
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
about the ten players?

735
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I think

736
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
it's a bit of a mess

737
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
for ZGDX.

738
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
No.

739
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
The snowman

740
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
who chose Smiling

741
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
is the one who chose Smiling.

742
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Smiling is the one

743
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
who got the effect

744
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
of the WQCB.

745
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Didn't you

746
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
choose a snowman?

747
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Didn't you play well?

748
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Then I'll take a snowman

749
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
and teach you

750
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
how to play with a snowman.

751
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Smiling is

752
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
better than

753
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,040
It's better to be a god than a family.

754
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
If he thinks like that,

755
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,040
he'll be a little arrogant.

756
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,800
I just...

757
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,440
I just made a joke.

758
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,280
This ZGDX

759
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,040
is still going to play 4 vs 1.

760
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,160
What's wrong with 4 vs 1?

761
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,000
What's wrong with 4 vs 1?

762
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,160
Didn't you see the last YQCB

763
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,360
playing 4 vs 1,

764
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
and then failed?

765
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,640
That's a joke.

766
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
It's not necessary to play it.

767
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
You can do it.

768
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,720
Everyone, come on.

769
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,280
Okay.

770
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,760
Come on.

771
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Don't say that I didn't remind you.

772
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,000
Don't say such a nonsense.

773
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,120
After playing the game,

774
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,200
you'll go back and watch your Weibo.

775
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
You'll know what's going on.

776
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,000
Okay, the game begins.

777
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,920
Now, the double-decker

778
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,440
has arrived at their own lane.

779
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,120
The girl in the middle

780
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,240
will face the face-down machine.

781
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,120
Come on, let's go down.

782
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,920
Let's go down.

783
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,480
The face-down machine and the knife

784
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,960
are starting to move down.

785
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
As long as we have to

786
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,080
fight with Bai Mu Hui and Bi An Hua

787
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,760
and chase down Xiao Fang and Chase Man,

788
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,960
we'll be able to win.

789
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,480
Let's go.

790
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,520
We have to kill ZGDX

791
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,480
and kill them all.

792
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,440
We can't let them go.

793
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,320
Yes.

794
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,360
Look, Xiao Fang and Chase Man

795
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,920
can only be sent down the tower.

796
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,640
The moon tower.

797
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Let's go.

798
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,920
The moon tower.

799
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,800
The Bi An Hua will go directly to the tower.

800
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,720
The three people in the circle

801
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
will go down the tower directly.

802
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
The attack is so strong.

803
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,440
This is not a normal match.

804
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,080
It's amazing.

805
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,120
The Bi An Hua and Chase Man

806
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,240
have both lost their big moves.

807
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,920
The old man's death

808
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,480
has been controlled.

809
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,440
Bai Mu Hui is coming.

810
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,920
Xiao Fang is going to kill them.

811
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,520
I'm going to push.

812
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,240
I'm going to push.

813
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm going to the tower.

814
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,640
Come on.

815
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,480
You can go.

816
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,600
You can't win.

817
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,480
You can't win.

818
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,640
The real deal

819
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
of this match is a big mess.

820
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,320
If I had played like this

821
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,760
I might have given up early.

822
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,280
But obviously,

823
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,720
there is no time for ZGDX.

824
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,240
Now,

825
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,320
you take Xiao Fang and Chase Man.

826
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,880
Let's go.

827
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,920
We'll go too.

828
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,160
This time,

829
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,040
we have a big fight.

830
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
The old man has left.

831
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,320
The face-to-face game is a big deal.

832
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,000
He has been losing.

833
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,360
Old man and old cat are all in trouble.

834
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,280
Do you want to fight?

835
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,640
Let's see.

836
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,000
The nine-point game is over.

837
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Let's go.

838
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,320
We have to take a step back.

839
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,480
Mo Ru Shou Ren and Chase Man

840
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,400
are in a good match.

841
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,760
They have taken Old Man and Old Cat directly.

842
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,360
The seal.

843
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,000
Double-clutch.

844
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,640
Nice.

845
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,160
This is not bad.

846
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,240
Not bad.

847
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,800
Xiao Fang and Tong Yao,

848
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,480
let me take a break.

849
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,400
I have time to make a move.

850
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Okay.

851
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,200
Xiao Fang, follow me.

852
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,920
Coming.

853
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,560
Man Lin.

854
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,320
Man Lin, open the door.

855
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,040
Double-clutch.

856
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,680
Face-to-face game.

857
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,400
Don't forget.

858
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,840
Chase.

859
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,240
Chase.

860
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,560
Xiao Fang,

861
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,760
Chase Man and Chase Man

862
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,560
face-to-face game.

863
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,080
The seal.

864
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,760
Nice.

865
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,360
The air-conditioner

866
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,960
has made a beautiful firework.

867
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
It's not bad.

868
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,840
It's really not bad.

869
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,680
It's so amazing.

870
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
It's really amazing.

871
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,280
Look at Man Lin.

872
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,600
The timing and rhythm

873
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,960
are very good.

874
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,880
Xiao Fang's cooperation is also very good.

875
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,840
You can see

876
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,720
that the female teacher

877
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,520
is still very good.

878
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,200
We can see

879
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,000
that the ten-quick players

880
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,800
are very good.

881
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,200
They are already

882
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,640
playing very well.

883
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,240
Yes, that's right.

884
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,760
Why?

885
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,440
Because Chase Man

886
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,760
is the one who is the best in ZGDX.

887
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,360
He is the core of the team.

888
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,680
When the economy is weak,

889
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,720
he can only let Man Lin

890
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,080
to play against some small teams

891
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
to ensure his own development time.

892
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,040
But the Mo's team

893
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,680
has found this point.

894
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,200
I can go up.

895
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,960
I want to go up.

896
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,120
I'll go up.

897
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,600
The air-conditioner has been placed.

898
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,040
Chase Man's white wolf is in danger again.

899
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,960
No.

900
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
The chance to go up

901
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,000
is to attack the white wolf.

902
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,560
Chase Man's female team is out.

903
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:09,920
Yes.

904
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,960
I'll give it a shot.

905
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,440
Chase Man's one-quick firework.

906
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Who is the white wolf?

907
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,120
I won.

908
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,160
What happened?

909
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,320
Now he is the only one

910
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,040
who is going to attack the white wolf.

911
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,360
That's wonderful.

912
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,720
Cool.

913
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,840
Chen Hexiu.

914
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,240
Now we see

915
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,040
the Mo's team

916
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,440
is in the middle of the game.

917
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,040
It seems that

918
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
they are in a stable situation.

919
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,760
The team is gone.

920
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,640
The top two teams are gone too.

921
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,920
The big car is making money.

922
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,760
Chen,

923
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,640
can you move the car?

924
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:34,960
Okay.

925
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,680
You go to the ambush first.

926
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,200
Okay.

927
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,120
This way.

928
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,920
The Mo's team

929
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,240
is already in the big car.

930
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,880
ZGDX is in the middle of the game.

931
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,600
They are hiding near the big car.

932
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,400
They are going to take this bag.

933
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,480
I've hidden it.

934
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,320
I've hidden it too.

935
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
I'll go to the CDOK.

936
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,600
Why is the car still in the middle of the game?

937
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,800
The Mo's team is not going to fight anymore?

938
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,200
The big car is going to let them go.

939
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,560
Chase Man is still in the middle of the game.

940
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,200
Chen,

941
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,400
the big car is gone.

942
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
If the big car is going to let them go,

943
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,720
it means

944
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,680
the victory of the game

945
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,920
is going to let them go.

946
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,680
Chen,

947
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,240
it's really hard to get here.

948
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,400
Chen, come here.

949
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,240
Can you not be afraid?

950
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,840
Look at this.

951
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
Chen, come here.

952
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,000
Wait a minute.

953
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,560
Come on.

954
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,160
The big snake is already on the enemy.

955
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,680
Chase Man is still in the middle of the game.

956
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,120
What is he waiting for?

957
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,640
There is only economic advantage in this game.

958
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,880
If we take this big snake again,

959
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,720
the victory of the game

960
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,640
will be hard to get.

961
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,120
Where is the car?

962
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,000
Wait for me.

963
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,640
Wait for me.

964
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,880
What am I looking at?

965
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,680
Chase Man's White Wolf is almost full.

966
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,640
It seems that this snake

967
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
is going to have a play.

968
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
White Wolf is in this time.

969
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,360
After the 18th season,

970
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,520
the attack distance is very far.

971
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,080
And it's hard to catch with a high attack.

972
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,480
It feels like it's going to move.

973
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,800
Yes.

974
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Just one soldier.

975
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,480
Just one soldier.

976
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,160
Just one soldier.

977
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,720
Just one soldier.

978
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,000
Is it a little bit more?

979
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm coming.

980
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,760
Two.

981
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,400
One.

982
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,520
You can start the group.

983
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,000
Go.

984
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,720
Look at my position.

985
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,160
Go.

986
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,360
Get ready.

987
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,160
Little man, come with me.

988
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,560
Come.

989
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,080
I want to see it.

990
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,800
I want to see it.

991
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,640
Go.

992
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,840
Input him to 3000 points

993
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,960
like a?)

994
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,760
Go, 디렁!

995
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,200
Go.

996
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,200
Look at your laugh.

997
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,880
Don't say anything.

998
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Would you like to fight watzi red wolf?

999
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,640
Honestly,

1000
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,360
I don't want to see it flat

1001
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:35,440
but差서의

1002
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,480
beat,

1003
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
right?

1004
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,080
Chief.

1005
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,800
Chief.

1006
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,800
Chief.

1007
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,480
Chief.

1008
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,880
Chief.

1009
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,600
Chief.

1010
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,260
Chief.

1011
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,000
Chief.

1012
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,960
Chief.

1013
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,800
Chief.

1014
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,440
Chief.

1015
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,200
Chief.

1016
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,320
Chief.

1017
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,560
Chief.

1018
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,960
Chief.

1019
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,000
Chief.

1020
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,840
Chief Chief.

1021
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,080
Chief Chief.

1022
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,360
Chief Chief.

1023
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,960
Chief.

1024
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,520
Police.

1025
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,160
Chief.

1026
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,060
Merely 1 solo artist only here

1027
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,460
Coming

1028
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,560
Congratulations, VGDX.

1029
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,240
You're the best!

1030
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,680
Congratulations, VGDX.

1031
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,240
You're the best!

1032
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,800
Congratulations, VGDX.

1033
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
You're the best!

1034
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Congratulations, VGDX.

1035
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
You're the best!

1036
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,280
Congratulations, VGDX.

1037
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
You're the best!

1038
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,080
Yes.

1039
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,440
In this match,

1040
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,880
VGDX has successfully

1041
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,280
defeated the White Wolf.

1042
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,520
But the bitter revenge

1043
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,960
of the last game

1044
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,760
was not easy.

1045
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
They won the match with VGDX.

1046
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,360
Of course,

1047
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,240
I knew more about it.

1048
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,040
The players who played

1049
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,240
the match

1050
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:47,160
will be challenged to some match

1051
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Are you okay?

1052
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,640
I thought it would be tough for you.

1053
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,080
Sc Army's performance

1054
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,160
is good.

1055
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,320
And your?

1056
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
She is a great match.

1057
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,640
All become optimization.

1058
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Let me explain.

1059
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
She is superb atENAR.

1060
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,920
Yeah.

1061
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,720
Her organization consists of

1062
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,160
human resources

1063
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,680
and climate agree.

1064
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,320
First, congratulations to the ZGTX team

1065
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,480
for keeping their spirit alive.

1066
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,320
Thank you, Dong.

1067
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,880
At the same time, we were very surprised

1068
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,120
that after the YQCB match,

1069
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,560
we still didn't leave the scene

1070
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,480
and had the chance to interview our special contestant.

1071
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,800
We actually wanted to leave,

1072
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,280
but the coach didn't let us.

1073
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,160
We were in the rest room

1074
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,400
and asked to see how Si Bao Yi played.

1075
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,320
Because it's a new game,

1076
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,080
so we're not familiar with it.

1077
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,720
Hello, I'd like to ask the ZGTX team.

1078
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
The number of Si Bao Yi's tactics

1079
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,840
is not so suitable

1080
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,400
for the weak version of the game.

1081
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,960
Why did you still

1082
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,200
insist on such tactics

1083
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,840
after the YQCB match?

1084
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,520
Our midlaner said

1085
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,960
he also wanted to try Si Bao Yi

1086
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,400
and try to play with the girls.

1087
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,240
I thought it would be fine.

1088
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,600
I just wanted to teach him

1089
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,160
how to play Si Bao Yi in other players.

1090
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,520
So I played two Si Bao Yi.

1091
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,120
Okay, thank you.

1092
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,560
Si Bao Yi, I'll go to the club.

1093
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,080
Where are you going?

1094
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,120
I want to ask XB.

1095
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,660
There have been scenarios

1096
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,000
that happened after the second match,

1097
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,080
Mr. Outfit 3

1098
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
didn't show up hitchhiking.

1099
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,280
Have you ever beenpowered?

1100
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,680
Fans want to know.

1101
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,160
Actually,

1102
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,240
the first match

1103
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,400
entered the academy

1104
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,080
and suggested the competition.

1105
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,360
I know

1106
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,160
so many people are talking online.

1107
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,240
He said that the love family didn't want to go to the big brand.

1108
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,720
Actually, it's not like that.

1109
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,360
It's just that we're not in a good mood.

1110
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,960
Actually, it was because of the love family's bad mood.

1111
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,000
We thought that it might be more suitable for us to let the T-Po contest.

1112
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,080
That's why we changed our mind.

1113
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,200
Let me ask you.

1114
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Why did you get upset?

1115
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Didn't you see it?

1116
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,600
Wait. Let's not talk about it.

1117
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,520
I want to ask you.

1118
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,320
During this period,

1119
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,200
you've been doing your own thing about the players' personal feelings.

1120
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,640
As the professional players,

1121
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,400
what do you think of it?

1122
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,720
Of course.

1123
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,920
There's not much to think about.

1124
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,520
We usually practice for most of the time.

1125
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,000
We rarely have time to hang out with strangers.

1126
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,120
So, most of us are still single.

1127
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,520
That doesn't mean we're in the same team.

1128
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,920
We can't find them.

1129
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,840
But we don't want to find them.

1130
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,800
We can't find them either.

1131
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,640
If we want to figure it out, what's going on?

1132
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,320
But I still hope that the players can focus on the game.

1133
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,960
We'll compete for the World Champion in the World Championship.

1134
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,520
Don't think too much about other things.

1135
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,000
For example, when we're doing a training in the live broadcast,

1136
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,560
we'll just look at the details of the game.

1137
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,760
When we're playing the game,

1138
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,120
we shouldn't play other weird games.

1139
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
In a team like this,

1140
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,400
don't we often discuss these things?

1141
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,240
I hope that you can play seriously

1142
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,320
and win the World Champion.

1143
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,120
You'll get a good result.

1144
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,120
I'll repeat what you just said.

1145
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,720
Do you agree?

1146
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,000
Don't do anything.

1147
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,120
I hope that my parents can learn from their children.

1148
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,960
They'll be able to get a good grade in the future.

1149
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,280
So, we don't need to think about other things.

1150
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,080
It's like they always hope that when you're resting in the living room,

1151
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,880
you can be alone.

1152
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,120
Don't play those weird games.

1153
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,520
Our parents often discuss these topics.

1154
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,520
But they also hope that you can learn from them.

1155
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,520
They'll get a good grade and have a good life.

1156
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
It sounds reasonable.

1157
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,520
But the fans who usually suggest this kind of thing

1158
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
are usually this age.

1159
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Or they're some of the experienced in the job.

1160
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,520
They also ask for the professional players of normal people.

1161
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,320
I don't think about those who are always

1162
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,520
playing professional players and don't train hard

1163
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
and only play love.

1164
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Or those who are playing other games while resting.

1165
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,520
You'll be in class or at work

1166
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
and you'll be able to play the game.

1167
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Or you'll be able to take out your phone and play the game.

1168
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,520
I just hope that everyone can think about it.

1169
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Everyone is very young.

1170
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
No one has ever played the game.

1171
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
No one has ever slept.

1172
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,520
No one has ever peeked the game.

1173
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Although I don't have such experience,

1174
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I want to say that

1175
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
professional players are different.

1176
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
They're like the saints.

1177
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
They're perfect.

1178
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,520
If you take the players to the club all day long,

1179
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
play the game tomorrow,

1180
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
and talk about love in the day after tomorrow,

1181
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
it's not easy.

1182
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Most of our time is in training.

1183
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Even our training time is even more

1184
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
than the time we learn from someone.

1185
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,520
When many people graduate from high school,

1186
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
because of the low-level training,

1187
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
the two places of the university have to be separated.

1188
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
And we're not doing anything.

1189
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
We're just playing.

1190
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Why?

1191
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Do you think that Cheng Ke said that...

1192
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Why?

1193
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
He suggested that you guys go to interview...

1194
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
the CK team's player, Yang Shen.

1195
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
He'll tell you why.

1196
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
He's really a good player.

1197
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Cheng Ke,

1198
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
you seem to be very kind to these players.

1199
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
My age is not that small in this circle.

1200
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
I've been playing for many years.

1201
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
I've seen a lot of things.

1202
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
So,

1203
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
you don't object to the fact that...

1204
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Cheng Ke is in love with the player?

1205
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,520
I don't object to the fact that he's a good player.

1206
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
It's not that the story of the legend of the CK team...

1207
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
has never been heard.

1208
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Cheng Ke, do you want to play too?

1209
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
I already have a crush on him.

1210
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
I like him.

1211
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
You like him too?

1212
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
My god,

1213
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
we're not even close.

1214
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
He didn't say anything.

1215
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
He didn't hear anything.

1216
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Don't be so red.

1217
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Don't be red.

1218
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Don't be too red.

1219
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Be calm.

1220
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Be calm.

1221
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
What do you think about the fans who...

1222
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
requested too much?

1223
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Thank you for your support and love.

1224
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
I'll work hard for the future.

1225
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
If possible,

1226
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
I hope to get more support.

1227
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
And I want to say,

1228
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,520
if you really like a professional player,

1229
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
you should stay away from his competition.

1230
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
Stay away from his life.

1231
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Thank you.

1232
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
Just now...

1233
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Right?

1234
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Get me some air.

1235
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
I'll teach you.

1236
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Let's go.

1237
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
Let's go.

1238
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
Let's go.

1239
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Let's go.

1240
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
If these two are not as beautiful as I thought,

1241
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,520
the way the four treasures are made of a single-dress and a single-dress,

1242
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
I can't finish them all.

1243
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
How can I thank you?

1244
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
I'll cut your head off.

1245
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
No.

1246
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
You're not a good person.

1247
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
I'm not.

1248
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
You are.

1249
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Because I want to protect you two.

1250
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Someone said that

1251
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
the meaning of love is

1252
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,520
the one that suddenly appeared in the world.

1253
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,520
He can give you everything you want.

1254
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
He can do whatever he wants.

1255
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
No matter how much he is afraid,

1256
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,520
he can do whatever he wants.

1257
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
He can do whatever he wants.

1258
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
I'm sorry.

1259
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
I'm sorry.

1260
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
I miss you.

1261
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
I want to get closer.

1262
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
A little closer.

1263
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,520
A face without a face.

1264
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
I'm calm.

1265
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,520
The heart beat is always the best.

1266
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Never want to be blind.

1267
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
Just look for the information.

1268
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Just me and you.

1269
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
A touch.

1270
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
You're like my information.

1271
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,520
I've been thinking about you for a long time.

1272
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Never want to be blind.

1273
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
Just look for the information.

1274
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,520
Just me and you.

1275
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
A touch.

1276
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,520
You're like my information.

1277
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,520
I'll take your hand.

1278
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,520
I'll take your hand.

1279
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,520
I'll take your hand.

1280
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,520
I'll take your hand.

1281
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
I'll take your hand.

1282
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
I'll take your hand.

1283
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
I'll take your hand.

1284
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,520
I'll take your hand.

1285
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
I'll take your hand.

1286
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
I'll take your hand.

1287
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
I'll take your hand.

1288
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
I'll take your hand.

1289
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
I'll take your hand.
