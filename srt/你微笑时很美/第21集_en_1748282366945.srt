1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,600
A pair of girls with a crush,

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,600
and a girl with a crush.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,520
She's a crush.

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,440
It's not worth it.

6
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,720
Forget it.

7
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,160
Xu Tai Lun is in the competition.

8
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,800
We can't see her anymore.

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,160
You're so mean.

10
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,120
You're such a vicious girl.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,120
Are you okay?

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,120
Did I destroy her?

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
If you had known,

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,320
why did you do it?

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,920
Brother Cheng,

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,120
why are you here?

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Why did you do this?

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,720
Didn't they give you the umbrella?

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,720
I hated her at first.

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,920
But now I think

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,120
she has a crush on her fans

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,120
while she hates her fans.

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,120
No matter it's Xu Tai Lun or us.

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,120
But she likes her own fans.

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
But she likes her own feelings.

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,120
She does what she wants to do,

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,120
and she's exposed to the light.

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,120
When I think about it,

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
I think that

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,120
we might not be

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,120
loved by others.

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,120
You're so mean.

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,120
I don't know when

34
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Gui Quan has always said

35
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,120
that love is not a matter of time.

36
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Do you want to try it?

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
What is it?

38
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Me.

39
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,120
And you are an exception.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,120
The End

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Brother Cheng,

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
please set the set in the right way.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
No, no.

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
I can't stand it

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
if you do this.

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
How many times do you want to play with the same dog?

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm telling you.

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
I'm not afraid of it this time.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Where are you going?

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Come with me.

51
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
What are you doing?

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
What?

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
What did I say?

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
You're like this.

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Did I ask you to

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
go to the hole with me?

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Don't say that.

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Lu Si Cheng,

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
let me tell you.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
It's not like this

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
with other people's confession.

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
It's like this.

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
You know how to be open-minded.

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
How can you do this?

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Which one?

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
The Bear.

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
I'll be gentle.

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Will you agree?

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
Yes.

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Look,

71
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
you're silent.

72
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
I really want to

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
pull out the bear and the bear to fight.

74
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
None of their business.

75
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
You look at it now

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
and see how scary your expression is.

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Yuan Bao is waiting now.

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
At least I'll tell you

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
what kind of general military I am.

80
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Now,

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
I know that

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
I can't see your expression.

83
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
If there is another bear like this,

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
you don't have to wait until the final.

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
You've already returned to my Buddha.

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
After all, there are many people

87
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
in this circle.

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Unlike me.

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm fine.

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Why don't you wait

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
until the final

92
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
and then tell me?

93
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
The angel is the best.

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
I think this idea is very good.

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
You should take the medicine.

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Do you have any principles?

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
If you asked me last time

98
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
if I was a perfect person

99
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
who has no fear of anything,

100
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
I already said that I'm not.

101
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
If I insist on the principle,

102
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
I'll be looking at my favorite woman

103
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
and running around the country to knock on the fish.

104
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Then what do I insist on the principle?

105
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
But I'm myself?

106
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
So,

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
I'm the one who's self-loving.

108
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
You've never liked me.

109
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Then why do you want to

110
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
pretend to be a little fish

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
abandoned by a woman

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
behind the chair

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
and let me not go to see the opposite side of the blind?

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Then I'm going to be rejected.

115
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
I dare not.

116
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Then you've promised me.

117
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
I didn't.

118
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Then I know

119
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
you're just a simple little girl.

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Look.

121
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
It's just a kind of desire.

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
A desire for the captain.

123
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
A desire for the father.

124
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
A desire for the father.

125
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
What is a desire anyway?

126
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Anyway, it's not like a man's desire.

127
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
What I said to my boyfriend

128
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
is not about you.

129
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Why are you laughing?

130
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Put your mouth down.

131
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Take it back.

132
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Is it like a man's desire?

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
How do you know

134
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
if you don't give a chance?

135
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Don't bite my hand.

136
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
The old man is still playing.

137
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
It's a foul.

138
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Think about it.

139
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
I'll give you two hours.

140
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Before nine o'clock,

141
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
I'll tell you

142
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
that I'm not going to be a little girl.

143
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm not going to be a little girl.

144
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I'm not going to be a little girl.

145
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
I'm not going to be a little girl.

146
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm not going to be a little girl.

147
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
I'm not going to be a little girl.

148
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Before nine o'clock.

149
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Why nine o'clock?

150
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Because he's busy

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
and can sleep well at night.

152
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Drain your hair.

153
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Don't catch a cold.

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
There will be interviews later.

155
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Please come in tomorrow.

156
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,600
Tong Yao,

157
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
stay still.

158
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Have another bed.

159
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Okay.

160
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,720
They didn't teach me at all today.

161
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,520
They must be in a trance.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,240
If that's the case,

163
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,080
we don't need to do the interview today.

164
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,560
We'll write three versions of the topic.

165
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,080
Good.

166
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,360
The next interview is about

167
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,400
the Chessmen and Smelling

168
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,920
from ZGTX.

169
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Welcome.

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,240
First, I want to ask you

171
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,480
about the questions

172
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
about OPL.

173
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,440
The question is,

174
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,040
can we discuss

175
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,880
a good team member

176
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,880
such as Fanantek's team's team's team's team?

177
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,320
For example, YQCB's AD

178
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,280
and other teams' team members.

179
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
The rules are not very strict.

180
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
As for the way to play,

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,240
Han Yuan did bring us

182
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,200
many new tactics and tactics.

183
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
It's worth learning.

184
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
But we can't

185
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:25,920
overestimate Han Yuan

186
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,320
if we want to strengthen our team.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,360
What about the solution?

188
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
I heard that

189
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
there's a new

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,800
little style of the base team.

191
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,840
I want to ask you two

192
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,760
what's the attitude

193
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,960
about the base team?

194
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,000
The base team is not good.

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
It's more like managing the team.

196
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,840
It's mainly about the club.

197
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,080
It depends on the team.

198
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,880
If not,

199
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,240
the club can't be managed.

200
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,080
And

201
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,880
I want to emphasize something here.

202
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,760
Is there any foreign team

203
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,920
that has nothing to do with it?

204
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,600
The same situation

205
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
is the case with the national team.

206
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,920
The next question is

207
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
about the relationship

208
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,480
between the player and the fans.

209
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,120
We also know that

210
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,280
Xu Tai Lun's player

211
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,200
has been personally

212
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
reported by his girlfriend

213
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,880
who has been in a bad relationship with him.

214
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,160
It's a good coincidence.

215
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
Keep a distance.

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,160
As a person who is different from others,

217
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,040
no matter it's the male or the female,

218
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,760
it's not allowed.

219
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,280
As a fan,

220
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,400
you should know clearly

221
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,240
that when you see

222
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,960
the player you like,

223
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,160
is it a beautiful scene?

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,280
From the simple and pure likes

225
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
to the scary comrades-in-arms,

226
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,440
it's a very scary

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,720
and not recommended behavior.

228
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
It seems that the female Smaolin

229
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,560
has different views on this matter.

230
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,280
But I just heard two people answer.

231
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,520
One of them is the player in the circle.

232
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,040
There are still some

233
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,760
problems on the life style, right?

234
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,800
We are all very young.

235
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,400
If we get to know the society too early,

236
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,920
it's easy to be misled.

237
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,320
Just like when we just went to school,

238
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
we often get angry.

239
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,720
I hope we can do more classes.

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know.

241
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,040
Anyway, there is no problem

242
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,200
with my life style.

243
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,320
And I'm a man

244
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,080
who deserves to be entrusted.

245
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,880
So,

246
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,120
face the situation

247
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,080
of the bright and dark circle

248
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
and ask if you have considered

249
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,920
dating with the blind?

250
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Why not?

251
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Don't you want it?

252
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I don't know.

253
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Okay.

254
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,480
The interview is over here.

255
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
We also thank

256
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,680
the support of our media friends.

257
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Thank you.

258
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,720
Do you think

259
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
Chessman and Smaolin

260
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,200
seem to be a bit different?

261
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
What do you mean?

262
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
What do you mean?

263
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
Do you remember what Chessman said?

264
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,600
She likes

265
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,200
girls who are better at playing games.

266
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,680
You mean

267
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
they seem to be a bit selfish?

268
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,880
Right?

269
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,600
Go back.

270
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,360
We should prepare all the materials.

271
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,560
They will be announced.

272
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,000
We can steal the headlines.

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,520
Right.

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,320
Let's go.

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,840
Let's go.

276
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,320
iary-medium services

277
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,600
二星期

278
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
I'll give two hours

279
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
to you.

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,120
How many levels?

281
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,960
46.

282
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,440
It's you?

283
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,480
Why?

284
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,400
You shouldn't have to

285
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,160
do something imposing.

286
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,760
Actually, Yu Zaoqian told me that...

287
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
It's a kind of belief.

288
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
He wants to win the determination

289
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
and build a new belief.

290
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,760
Let's go.

291
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
You've seen it all.

292
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
You lost on purpose.

293
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I don't want you to go.

294
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Come on, Si Men.

295
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I knew Lu Si Shang would like you.

296
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
He must have let you down on purpose.

297
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Do you remember what he said?

298
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
He likes to play games and play better than him.

299
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Wear your shoes and eat.

300
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Brother Cheng, there's one last question.

301
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
You ignored me these days.

302
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Is it just because of anger?

303
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Because I'm afraid.

304
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
I'm afraid of being attacked.

305
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm afraid of being attacked.

306
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm afraid of being attacked.

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm afraid of being attacked.

308
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's 8.58 minutes 30 seconds in Beijing.

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You even reported it.

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Your answer is...

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I...

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Think it over.

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What's this?

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This is...

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes.

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Although the DQ is a bit far away,

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I brought back the hat that I successfully wore.

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Beijing time is 8.59 minutes 30 seconds.

319
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If I'm still single after 30 seconds,

320
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll take this hat away.

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What's wrong?

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm still single.

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm afraid of being attacked.

324
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm afraid of being attacked.

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm afraid of being attacked.

326
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm afraid of being attacked.

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm afraid of being attacked.

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Why are you holding my hand?

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Our story will be back in 12 years.

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Don't really know anything about Cantonese...

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
SWAG?

332
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
SoYes, Confucianism fellowship.

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
It's my 그�,

334
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,880
rather than the Canon,

335
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,080
it can't get a chance to defeat our independence.

336
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
SoYes, Confucianism fellowship.

337
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,580
Congratulations.

338
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Another person came.

339
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
I'll go to check with my kids.

340
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,120
Okay!

341
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
or with this brush,

342
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,140
how could I touch you?

343
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,180
businesses, right?

344
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,820
Keep text?

345
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,780
Yes.

346
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,560
essionclos.com

347
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,240
No, don't trace this right now.

348
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,720
Never mind.

349
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,520
Cousin,

350
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,260
Su Therapist יעש ע Gibson up,

351
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,760
can you go and click all six nuoc ASAP?

352
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Good.

353
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:43,960
Good.

354
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
Okay, got it.

355
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Tomas?

356
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,720
Should I just taste the groans?

357
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,560
I'll start from the carrot taste.

358
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,840
Nanny.

359
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,240
You told me that

360
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,400
that cat looks familiar.

361
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,320
I know what you want me to ask you,

362
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
I know I have the right to keep silence.

363
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,480
But everything I said

364
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,440
will become a lie.

365
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,960
This cat is Xu Tai Lun's man

366
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,920
and his fan Xiao San.

367
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,120
Is it that simple?

368
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,120
Xu Tai Lun was banned from the competition.

369
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,440
He didn't have any intention to raise a cat.

370
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,320
Our captain

371
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,560
took him from DQ Five.

372
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,520
I don't know if he gave them money.

373
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,880
It's about last night.

374
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,920
I named him Xiao Cong.

375
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,760
Because he was my cat.

376
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,640
So the problem is here.

377
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,760
Why is there two owners of a cat?

378
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,520
The answer is

379
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,360
there is a inseparable relationship

380
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,360
between me and the captain.

381
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,840
What?

382
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,960
That's it.

383
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,160
What?

384
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
That's it.

385
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
Excuse me.

386
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,520
Call me.

387
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,000
What?

388
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
You're a good chess man.

389
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Don't bother.

390
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,200
You don't know.

391
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,080
That's right.

392
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Milan is good.

393
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,600
The first-class fighter on the field

394
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,720
has lost hisог元.

395
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,440
You slept General Lu.

396
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
Not yet.

397
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,200
Are you sure no regulations for us?

398
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,600
No!

399
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,520
We do have one week left.

400
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,880
It's a pity, right?

401
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Think about it.

402
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
When are you going

403
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,920
to do your couple's wedding?

404
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,640
Hi there,

405
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,200
and you enjoy it?

406
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
That's the sound of your face.

407
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Actually, I didn't expect that.

408
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I really didn't expect that.

409
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
It's just that I suddenly said that yesterday.

410
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
And our captain also took the cat set.

411
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
I didn't take the pig for a moment and agreed.

412
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
But now he's still using it.

413
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Our captain said that

414
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
the only standard of the time is the verification process.

415
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
What process?

416
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
He's a good man.

417
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
He's different from Xu Tai Lun.

418
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Well,

419
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
and so on.

420
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Can you two

421
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
have a normal relationship?

422
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
It's a secret information.

423
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Now we've done some experiments.

424
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
I'm not satisfied with it.

425
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Three months of use.

426
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Five years of full-fledged relationship.

427
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Okay, okay.

428
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Well,

429
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
you can use it well.

430
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
You can't drink that.

431
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Let's see next time.

432
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Let's play a game.

433
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
But we didn't get rid of the ban.

434
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Okay, then I'll talk to you again.

435
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Who are you talking to?

436
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
A normal social partner.

437
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Who?

438
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Next to me.

439
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
A normal social partner.

440
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
You don't know that.

441
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
When the first day of the teaching in China,

442
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
a fan took your chessboard to the airport

443
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
and ran into you.

444
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
What did you just say?

445
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
You're so happy.

446
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
You don't study and you don't read.

447
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
After Xu Tai Lun's report,

448
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
we interviewed him again yesterday.

449
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Now,

450
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
in the national industry,

451
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
no matter if it's an alien,

452
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
it's not up to you.

453
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
We need to ask the club to manage it.

454
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
I asked the coach

455
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
whether we should do

456
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
the fighting between men.

457
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
For example, drinking.

458
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
He said it's forbidden.

459
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
After 10 o'clock in the evening,

460
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
the club will ban it.

461
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Unless there's a mass event,

462
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
or else he'll be starving to death.

463
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
And this kind of thing.

464
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Will it be a mess?

465
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm so proud of myself.

466
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
I don't need to look for Jing Yang.

467
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Brother Errui.

468
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
The next door is open.

469
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
We can't fall behind.

470
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
We don't have a door.

471
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Our team members are self-sufficient.

472
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
We don't need to be so proud.

473
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Self-sufficient?

474
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Your ID just now

475
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
wants to go out and drink with the next door.

476
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Let go.

477
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Let go.

478
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Let go.

479
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Let go.

480
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Let go.

481
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Lu Si Cheng.

482
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Tong Yao.

483
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Come and see if your cat is hungry.

484
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Let me see.

485
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Let go.

486
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Let go.

487
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Let go.

488
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Look.

489
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Why are you still holding it?

490
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Are you hungry?

491
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm hungry.

492
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Look.

493
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Look at the little belly.

494
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Little belly.

495
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Are you hungry?

496
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Your hand is so soft.

497
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Are you a stinky dragon?

498
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm hungry.

499
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Who are you?

500
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm the best cat in the world.

501
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm a good cat.

502
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
What?

503
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
I'm a good cat.

504
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Yixing is like a big cat.

505
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm a good cat.

506
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,200
It's my little brother.

507
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
I'm a good cat.

508
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
My little brother.

509
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm a good cat.

510
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Yixing is like a big cat.

511
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Yixing is like a big cat.

512
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,920
Okay.

513
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,720
With Xu Tai Lun's

514
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,920
OPL Club's full management,

515
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
YQCB is the first to make a rule.

516
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,600
The team members leave the house alone after 10 o'clock.

517
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
What's the difference between this and the jail?

518
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
The gate is closed at night.

519
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,600
One person has a set of five-year-old college entrance exams.

520
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,520
Three-year-old model.

521
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,080
Don't say that you're a general finals champion.

522
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,880
A few years later,

523
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,600
I think it's not a big deal.

524
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,520
It's not just about the Korean people.

525
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,440
It's mostly about the human being.

526
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,680
It's not that all people are human.

527
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,360
Isn't the YQCB's loyal family

528
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,840
just a typical thing?

529
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:22,320
Girls often appear in the

530
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:30,520
uvo vern exceptionally bad for girls.

531
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,800
聖父真 is very modest.

532
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,200
It's a fact.

533
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,760
When I was young...

534
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,960
very young...

535
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,680
Life is a dream

536
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,600
But I live between two Construction cities.

537
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,320
About his behaviour,

538
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,480
he has tall and talleschali unknown consider Volkswagen,

539
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,920
You might be in a school.

540
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,080
But I suggest you don't go to Jingquan Yang's factory

541
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,320
and do the usual thing with them.

542
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,440
Women are so scary.

543
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,120
Luckily, I'm single.

544
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,800
I don't want other girls to affect her career.

545
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,640
I hope you can be nice to her.

546
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,680
Stay away from her.

547
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,180
The day before yesterday

548
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,040
The day before yesterday

549
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,080
What should we do?

550
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,840
It's my first time telling them

551
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,560
that I have model relationship.

552
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,360
Without菀,

553
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,760
we didn't get the�� trophy.

554
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,840
Ma'am.

555
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,560
The first-time platform adequate to

556
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,840
have Windows novices

557
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,760
searched for them,

558
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,400
will he be in love with her?

559
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,280
It's like pushing her

560
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,960
into a mountain withナユユヨナソ.

561
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,280
No joy.

562
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,960
No hunger.

563
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,040
A tiny lectures with no touch.

564
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,800
But once you eat Obsidian Ya flies off

565
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,560
all your secrets will be back to normal.

566
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,680
What?

567
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,560
You know what?

568
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,520
It'll be hard to devide food.

569
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,520
My girlfriend was the one I chased for a long time.

570
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
When she was in the city.

571
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Yes, yes, I chased her.

572
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
I chased her.

573
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
Let me emphasize.

574
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,520
The important thing is that I chased her three times.

575
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
There are a lot of pictures of her.

576
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Every time I see her, I see her in my eyes.

577
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
She's shining with a bright light.

578
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Tell me. I'll be happy right away.

579
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
What's wrong with my girlfriend?

580
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
Is she here? We're all treasured.

581
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
She's so good at playing the game.

582
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
She's so good at playing the game.

583
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
She's so good at playing the game.

584
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,520
I heard you were shy when you were standing next to her.

585
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
Don't be so formal.

586
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I like it.

587
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Miss can win the grand prize.

588
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Go play.

589
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
I want to play with you.

590
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
You're really good at playing the game.

591
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
I know you're particularly interested in me.

592
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
And you have some special opinions.

593
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
I've seen the sincere blessings of Weibo.

594
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
I want to respond to this.

595
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
The shoes of R&W are not for a friend.

596
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
It's the hands of the ladies

597
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
who use these old hands

598
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,520
to carry them back from their own cabinets.

599
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
And then,

600
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
don't just take these little things.

601
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Look at this.

602
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
This is the gift from our family

603
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
from the 2018 Double 11.

604
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Are you happy?

605
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Are you satisfied?

606
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
From now on,

607
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
no matter if it's a knife or a fire,

608
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
it's still a big deal.

609
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
I won't be a thief.

610
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Take your time.

611
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
Don't listen to him.

612
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Do you know how much the car costs?

613
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
I don't know.

614
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
I can't afford to buy it.

615
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
I'll give it to him with my head.

616
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm not lying to you.

617
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
You don't know how much the car costs.

618
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
You can search it online by yourself.

619
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
I don't have that much money to give it to him.

620
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
They're all hiding from the rhythm.

621
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
You see the rhythm.

622
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
The silver head is on the fire.

623
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,520
And you're the one who took the lead.

624
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
You're the one who took the lead

625
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,520
in the very first part of your rhythm.

626
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
You're amazing, my sister.

627
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Please call me

628
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Lord Queen.

629
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
Lord Queen.

630
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
Did you sleep well?

631
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
No.

632
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
You can go now.

633
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
You missed me?

634
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Brother,

635
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
five minutes ago,

636
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,520
we just played a game together.

637
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Okay?

638
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
I missed you.

639
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
May I ask

640
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
are you playing the game of the book?

641
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Or are you playing the game of the red stone?

642
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I'm playing the game of the smoke.

643
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Xiao Yanzi,

644
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
are you thirsty?

645
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
No, I'm not.

646
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I'm not thirsty.

647
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
I'm just a little hungry.

648
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
I'll give Tong Yao some water.

649
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Hit him.

650
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Wait a minute.

651
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Wait for me.

652
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
What's this?

653
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
I told them

654
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
you asked me to get you some water.

655
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
You're quite smart.

656
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Do you have any hope?

657
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
What's wrong?

658
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Now everyone knows

659
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
that OPL is not in the big play.

660
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm not sure.

661
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
I'm not sure.

662
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
OPL is not in the big play.

663
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
I heard that

664
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
DK5 has changed

665
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
several people in the management.

666
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Isn't it good?

667
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
It's not good.

668
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
The fire is too strong.

669
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Even the players

670
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
are used to playing.

671
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
They said our Jin Yang

672
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
loves the family.

673
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
They said that

674
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
they would go to the chicken farm

675
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
to train the family every day.

676
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
They said that

677
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
there is a fox in the living room.

678
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Aren't your friends

679
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
open a security program?

680
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
How long does it take

681
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
to buy the family's private property?

682
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
They don't know that.

683
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
They don't know

684
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
that you're angry with me?

685
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Are you done?

686
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
Look at this.

687
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
Women are so scary.

688
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
I'm lucky to be a single dog.

689
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
I don't want other girls

690
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
to affect her career.

691
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
I hope that

692
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
all of you

693
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
can be together

694
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
and stay away from her.

695
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Do you know

696
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
the comments of my fans

697
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
don't represent me?

698
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
You're very unfair to me.

699
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
I know.

700
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
But

701
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
you might be

702
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
a single dog

703
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
who only knows how to play games.

704
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
You're more suitable for the role.

705
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
If you fall in love with someone,

706
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
you'll never

707
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
have a dream

708
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
of being a girl.

709
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
I won't.

710
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Why not?

711
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
How do you feel

712
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
that it's harder

713
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
to be in love with someone?

714
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
It's not that hard.

715
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
It's not that good.

716
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
I won't force you.

717
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Really?

718
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Yes.

719
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
I'm the one who's the most precious to me.

720
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Thinking about it,

721
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
it might be more

722
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
difficult for you

723
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
than me.

724
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
But it doesn't mean

725
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
I'll regret it.

726
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
If you want to be satisfied,

727
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
you can do it.

728
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
I'm the one who's the most precious to you.

729
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
I'll be responsible for you.

730
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
You're the most precious to me.

731
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
How can I be the most precious to you?

732
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
Playing games

733
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
is too much

734
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
for the career.

735
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
You're so cute.

736
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
You're so serious about me.

737
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
What?

738
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Really?

739
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
You want to be a criminal

740
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
and come to the solo dream?

741
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
The kind of night?

742
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
What are you talking about?

743
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Get out.

744
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Tong Yao.

745
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Get out.

746
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
Have a good rest.

747
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Okay.

748
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
You've been sending me water.

749
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
She went to bed after sending me the WeChat.

750
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
She knocked on the door and stayed up all night.

751
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
How dare she!

752
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
She asked Captain to bring you water.

753
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Yes.

754
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
I don't know who gave her water.

755
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
How dare she!

756
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
The first round of the game is over.

757
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
The first round of the game is over.

758
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
The first round of the game is over.

759
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
The first round of the game is over.

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
The first round of the game is over.

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
The first round of the game is over.

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
The first round of the game is over.

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
The first round of the game is over.

The first round of the game is over.

767
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
The first round of the game is over.

768
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
The first round of the game is over.

769
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
The first round of the game is over.

770
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Congratulations.

771
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,760
Congratulations.

772
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Congratulations!

773
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,640
Miss Smiley is sleeping here.

774
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,520
This is a fun place to play.

775
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
It's Credits Team.

776
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
Nice to meet you.

777
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,640
Good night.

778
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,520
structure.

779
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,080
fly instrument.

780
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,640
It's a new start.

781
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,200
Can you sign for me?

782
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,000
Sure.

783
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,200
Thank you.

784
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,840
Can I take a photo?

785
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,000
Sure.

786
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,680
But you can't only take a photo of yourself

787
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,600
when the time comes.

788
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,960
Thank you.

789
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,040
Thank you.

790
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,760
Can you sign for me?

791
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,440
Look.

792
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,040
It's so good.

793
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,040
Thank you.

794
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,440
Why are you here?

795
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,800
Come to see the competition.

796
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,840
You're so considerate.

797
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,240
I've thought it through.

798
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,840
As long as you love the competition,

799
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,240
I'll come here.

800
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,040
I'll be the first one to come.

801
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,040
I just want to let those who don't believe in me

802
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
see how long the old man's head will last.

803
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,840
You can't get past this.

804
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,440
The more you think, the more you'll be angry.

805
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,440
Isn't this love?

806
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,640
Chen Jingyang?

807
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,440
He's still in the mood for this.

808
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,640
He's not afraid of you loving the competition.

809
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,240
Don't worry.

810
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,040
I'll take care of you.

811
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
I'll take care of you.

812
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,040
You can take care of the cat line.

813
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
It's you.

814
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
It's me.

815
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,040
Look.

816
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,240
I was so surprised.

817
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,040
I didn't expect

818
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
that the famous female model

819
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,440
would be with us today.

820
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,240
And she even helped us

821
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,640
to look at the girl's finger.

822
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,840
I was thinking,

823
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
who's the girl?

824
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,440
She's so handsome.

825
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,640
She's almost a fan.

826
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,040
Yes. We were thinking.

827
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
We didn't believe

828
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,640
that you'd be sitting next to us.

829
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,040
I didn't expect that

830
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,640
Mi Bu's chance would come so soon.

831
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
That's right.

832
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,440
Miss Smiley, here you are.

833
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,040
This time, don't be so greedy.

834
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,040
I'll always support you.

835
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,440
I'm sure that I'm a fan of you.

836
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,240
You're so generous.

837
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,840
It's better if you can stay.

838
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,840
A player who deserves to be followed

839
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,040
and liked by one,

840
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,440
the sister's shop is here.

841
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,040
You two can talk first.

842
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
We'll go to the back.

843
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,440
Bye.

844
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,840
Bye.

845
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,240
Let's go.

846
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,840
Bye.

847
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,840
Have you seen the girl?

848
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Let me tell you a joke.

849
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
You're looking for me.

850
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,040
I'm a fan of you.

851
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,240
You're like a fool.

852
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,840
I met a fan on the front stage.

853
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,440
There are so many.

854
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,640
And my personal fans.

855
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,240
I was going to leave the circle.

856
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,640
But I came back.

857
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
I had my support handbag on my hand.

858
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,040
I didn't believe that

859
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
I came back because of them.

860
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
I was with them.

861
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,440
I saw it.

862
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,440
You're a fool.

863
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
You can see it if you see it.

864
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,440
It hurts.

865
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,840
You're so generous.

866
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,040
Don't worry.

867
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,840
He came to protect me.

868
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
He's so considerate.

869
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,240
He doesn't look like the fan in our house.

870
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,040
He's just like the fan in our team.

871
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,040
Look.

872
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,240
Brother Cheng.

873
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,040
It's really Aunt Ma's uniform.

874
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,640
It's Du Zicheng.

875
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,040
I'm so handsome.

876
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,640
I'm so handsome.

877
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,440
I'm so handsome.

878
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,240
I saw it.

879
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
I've already caught you.

880
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,640
I can't see what you're like.

881
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,840
You're blind.

882
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,240
Talk to me.

883
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,040
Go in.

884
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Don't look at me.

885
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,040
I'm just going to jump up and down.

886
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,240
I'm so stupid.

887
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
You can't do that.

888
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,040
I'm so stupid.

889
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,440
I'm so stupid.

890
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm so stupid.

891
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,240
I'm so stupid.

892
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,640
I'm so stupid.

893
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm so stupid.

894
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,240
I'm so stupid.

895
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,440
I'm so stupid.

896
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,640
I'm so stupid.

897
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,040
I'm so stupid.

898
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm so stupid.

899
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,640
I'm so stupid.

900
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,040
I'm so stupid.

901
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,240
I'm so stupid.

902
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,440
I'm so stupid.

903
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,640
I'm so stupid.

904
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm so stupid.

905
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
I'm so stupid.

906
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
I'm so stupid.

907
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,240
I'm so stupid.

908
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
I'm so stupid.

909
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,440
I'm so stupid.

910
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,640
I'm so stupid.

911
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,240
I'm in my dream and in my dream.

912
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,640
You said you would tell me

913
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,040
and tell me my words.

914
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,040
In your heart.

915
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Now I know

916
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,640
how long you still have to go ahead.

917
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,840
You don't need to reason

918
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,640
to show yourrundledness.

919
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,040
A face without expression

920
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,440
Surrounded by calm

921
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,840
Heart beats are the best proof

922
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,040
Never speak, look, pass, pass

923
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,840
The world is me and you

924
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,240
A touch

925
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,840
You laugh at my breath

926
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,240
I also want to be with you

927
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
I want to get closer

928
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,640
A little bit closer

929
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,040
A face without expression

930
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,440
Surrounded by calm

931
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,040
Heart beats are the best proof

932
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,040
Never speak, look, pass, pass

933
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,840
The world is me and you

934
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,240
A touch

935
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,840
You laugh at my breath

936
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,240
I also want to be with you

937
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,040
I want to get closer

938
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
A face without expression

939
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Surrounded by calm

940
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Heart beats are the best proof

941
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Never speak, look, pass, pass

942
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
The world is me and you

943
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
A touch

944
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,040
You laugh at my breath

945
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,040
I also want to be with you

946
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
I want to get closer

947
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,040
A face without expression

948
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,040
Surrounded by calm

949
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,840
Heart beats are the best proof

950
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Never speak, look, pass, pass

951
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,840
The world is me and you

952
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,840
A touch

953
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,840
You laugh at my breath

954
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,840
I also want to be with you

955
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,840
I want to get closer

956
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,840
A face without expression
