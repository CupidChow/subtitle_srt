1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Brother Cheng, the last question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ask.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You ignored me these days.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Is it just because you were angry?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Or is it because of other reasons?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Because I'm afraid.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm afraid I'll be angry.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No one will sacrifice for their beloved thing.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Get ready.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is just the beginning.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Brother Cheng, the last question.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The battle is coming to an end.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Find out.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hold on.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's clear the way.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Go, go, go.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Go, go, go.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Go, go, go.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Go, go, go.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hurry up.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hurry up.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hold on.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hold on.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The X-ray has been taken.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is the real time.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The X-ray is very strong.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The battle is coming to an end.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Double-tie.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, the X-ray has been taken.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The brothers of the X-ray have been taken.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wu Yue, go.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What's going on?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The battle is coming to an end.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The battle is coming to an end.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Double-tie.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You guys keep the distance, go.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Double-tie.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Go.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The last battle is coming.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come on.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Go, go, go.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Go, go, go.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hold on.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hold on.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hold on.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The X-ray has been taken.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Be careful.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I have another one.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hurry up.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go, go, go.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The X-ray is coming.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Go, go, go.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The brothers of X-ray have been taken.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The X-ray has been taken.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Double-tie.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The X-ray has been taken.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Double-tie.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Double-tie.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Double-tie.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The X-ray has been taken.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We've got three votes.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We've got three votes.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's go.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's go.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Congratulations.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Congratulations.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Congratulations.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Congratulations.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Lu Yue.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Lu Yue, what would you like to eat?

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Lu Yue, what would you like to eat?

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What would you like to eat?

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Lu Yue.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What?

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You played well.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're the best in the whole court.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
After this court,

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
your fans will be worth 300,000.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you doing?

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What did Yin Shui Ji do to you?

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're so generous.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Brother, what did you say to Aizi?

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What's wrong with him?

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's always helping him.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's the best.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go eat.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I know.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
After this game,

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
we still have the record of the whole court.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Have you seen the fans?

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They've made a great contribution

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
for your victory and defeat.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
They've made a great contribution

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
for your country.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You've made a great contribution

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and you've lost 12,000.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm praising you.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you have conscience?

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're so ungrateful.

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You played well.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're so good.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right?

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why are you talking so much?

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How long will it take?

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who knows?

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's wait.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's been a long time.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's coming.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's coming.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Stop.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Stop.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you.

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Excuse me.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sorry.

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sorry.

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're quite a lot.

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's coming.

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's coming.

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Comrades,

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
what do you think of this game?

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm alive.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you think it's very unfair?

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're doing this

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
to protect your teammates.

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No.

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Are you worried

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that you'll be replaced by Lu Yue?

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm just a game changer.

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why, Master Shuxou?

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't you know

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that it will affect your image?

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Or do you know

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that as the only player

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
who can play well,

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
you'll be paid a lot of attention?

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In order to avoid attention,

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you can't bear to do this.

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's fine.

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How can he play well?

147
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You don't know him.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right.

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Without some time,

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you let him play first.

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I heard that he signed the contract.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes.

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Even if he's really good,

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
he didn't play the game before.

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Who knows if he played it by himself?

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He'll give it to him directly.

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
According to

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
the 246th Act of the People's Republic of China,

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
using violence or other methods

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to insult others,

161
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
or to incite the bandits,

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the situation is serious.

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Except for three years of friendship,

164
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the police, the management,

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and the power of the political power.

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So,

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
think carefully.

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Come on.

169
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Brother Cheng, he's really lying.

170
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You've been a member of the Political Science University for a hundred years.

171
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mr. Yu,

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
how do you feel about the new return of the hotel?

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's good.

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, I'm using my heart today.

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The team player

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
has made a great deal of

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yan Yan Luo today.

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He's really a big eater.

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is there anything you want to say?

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Not really.

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But our coach...

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Our coach, Ming Shen,

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
he said that the company has to return to the city.

186
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If he doesn't return,

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
he'll be a little embarrassed.

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So, I'm a little tired.

189
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So,

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
you'll play Yan Yan Luo?

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's a good player.

192
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think he's good at anything.

193
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's not good at playing with others.

194
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But he's good at playing behind.

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It seems that the relationship between the ZGDX team

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and the T-Boo is not that tense.

197
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's not that tense.

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We're different.

199
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We're different in play.

200
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's up to you.

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But in the current situation,

202
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
he's better than me.

203
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But I'll be stronger in the future.

204
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's definitely hard.

205
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It seems that Mr. Lv is

206
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
questioning the ZGDX team

207
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
in the return network.

208
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I believe that

209
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I have a judgment.

210
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If I want something,

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll go and fight for it.

212
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're a little cold-hearted.

213
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're still praising me.

214
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't think too much.

215
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm just trying to protect

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
my brother's team.

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're so mean.

218
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Please come in.

219
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's wrong?

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're back?

221
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm broken.

222
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Be careful.

223
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Wait for me.

224
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait for me.

225
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're not even talking about the little devil.

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Are you?

227
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll go to the store

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and buy a window sticker.

229
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Come on, brother.

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's take a photo.

231
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I want it.

232
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come on.

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's have a good look.

234
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This little boy is so beautiful.

235
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's got a bunch of girls around him.

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Little sister.

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why are you here?

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm here to eat.

239
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I posted a video yesterday.

240
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Someone said you were in the live room.

241
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm scolding people.

242
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I told them not to say you.

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're so nice.

244
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thank you.

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But don't do this next time.

246
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They'll scold you together.

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They'll get you involved.

248
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Get involved?

249
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't understand.

250
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Brother,

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you're not a blood type.

252
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're so mean.

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sister, you're so cute.

254
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're scolding people.

255
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're so cute.

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Today,

257
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I told Brother Tai Lun

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
that you're funny.

259
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Brother Tai Lun also said that you're funny.

260
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hello.

261
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I said no.

262
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is another brother's girl.

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Even if it's not,

264
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll be the second.

265
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Dreaming for nothing.

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Dreaming for nothing?

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Eat the same.

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Brother,

269
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you're not cute at all.

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sister,

271
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm going to eat.

272
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll contact you later.

273
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Walk carefully.

274
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Brother Tai Lun, he...

275
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What's Tai Lun?

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you familiar with him?

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He looks familiar.

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Another big man.

279
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's so cute.

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Sister,

281
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
what's wrong?

282
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Brother Tai Lun

283
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
is always like this.

284
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We've seen

285
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
the competition video of Ding Ke Five.

286
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No.

287
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's somewhere else.

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't be so serious.

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Eat it.

290
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I remember it.

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What's wrong?

292
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Where have I seen Brother Tai Lun?

293
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I saw him in the live broadcast of Ning Jia Qi.

294
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's the relationship between them?

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Two girlfriends?

296
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You don't know?

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Kid,

298
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
eat meat.

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're tall.

300
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Master,

301
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
stop in front of the guest room.

302
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Brother, what are you doing?

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm buying things.

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You don't have to wait for me.

305
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Bing Bing,

306
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
let's go eat.

307
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's go.

308
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's go.

309
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's eat.

310
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Bye.

311
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This...

312
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Xiao Yan Xian, come here.

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This...

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What's wrong?

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This...

316
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Why are there only two of Brother Cheng's girlfriends?

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There are still three before the competition.

318
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You saw it wrong, right?

319
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, you see it yourself.

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
beslash

321
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
draft

322
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,760
Then,

323
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,960
I'll do it.

324
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,720
Just wait for him.

325
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,200
Let's find him.

326
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,980
火

327
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Look.

328
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
What do you think?

329
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,840
Do you think Brother Cheng is a fool?

330
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,480
Maybe he can't see the duck.

331
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,080
The color is different.

332
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,400
What are you doing?

333
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,080
Brother Cheng, your son knows something.

334
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,880
He's dead.

335
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,960
I'll help you to see him.

336
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,240
I'll help you to see him.

337
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,960
Think about it.

338
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,520
I haven't thanked Brother Cheng's education.

339
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,400
Education means

340
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,640
my parents' support.

341
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
Brother Cheng is so kind-hearted.

342
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,600
He's kind-hearted.

343
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,520
He loves everything he has.

344
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,200
He's a good man.

345
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
He's a good man.

346
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,840
He's a good man.

347
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,640
Wang Yao,

348
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,320
talk to him.

349
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,760
My cat

350
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
is a good man.

351
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
He's a good man.

352
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
He ate your fish.

353
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,600
I was wrong.

354
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,760
Be optimistic.

355
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,760
You think so?

356
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,240
Maybe your golden fish son

357
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,760
is gone.

358
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,920
There's a famous Chinese name

359
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
in the north.

360
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,360
It's called the Great One.

361
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,400
It's called the Great One.

362
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,800
Great 먹어�

363
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,760
あと

364
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,840
Um,

365
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,480
Hello sister

366
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,720
So kind

367
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,000
Of course

368
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Today is the weather

369
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,040
The day of the typhoon

370
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,420
of course happy

371
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,760
Really

372
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,480
Is that so?

373
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,800
The captain of your team

374
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,440
is a good match for the fate.

375
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
What do you mean?

376
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,560
The captain of your team

377
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,360
is playing games

378
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,440
in the live broadcast room.

379
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,080
He is searching for

380
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,600
the real life fish body.

381
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,560
The boss just called me.

382
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,200
I'm calling you.

383
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm hanging up.

384
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,040
I don't want to be the reason

385
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,400
for your captain's heart.

386
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,920
Brother Cheng,

387
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,560
the real life fish body can't be bought.

388
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,520
Search for something else.

389
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,960
I don't know why

390
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,840
the search result is not a fish body.

391
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,960
But the thing

392
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,640
is like the fish tank.

393
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,360
So I bought it.

394
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,000
Brother Cheng, what effect?

395
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,240
Who is going to bite

396
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,000
the fish first?

397
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,640
Fish body?

398
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,160
No.

399
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,640
He won't eat my cake.

400
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
I'm sorry,

401
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,560
for the cake.

402
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,200
No!

403
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,320
Great Ice Emphyidero...

404
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,280
Great Ice Emphyidero...

405
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,120
Great Ice Emphyidero!

406
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,120
Great Ice Emphyidero...

407
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,080
Hurry.

408
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,480
Don't move.

409
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,120
Move again.

410
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,520
Lu Si Cheng, I'm not...

411
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,520
Sit down.

412
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,320
You...

413
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,440
Brother Cheng, why aren't you sleeping?

414
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,240
I...

415
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,320
I...

416
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,720
I must be dreaming.

417
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,920
Go to sleep.

418
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,920
My god.

419
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,920
I saw that hand.

420
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
I'm so happy.

421
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,320
I didn't expect that kind of captain.

422
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
It's so embarrassing.

423
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Why did I see it?

424
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Why did I see it again?

425
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
I've been watching it for a year.

426
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,120
365 days.

427
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,720
I've been waiting for this.

428
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,520
I've been waiting for this for five days.

429
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm so anxious.

430
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,320
Why did I choose this day?

431
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
I love my eyes.

432
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
Actually, you're always...

433
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I want to hug you.

434
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,520
What?

435
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,520
Why are you so shocked?

436
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,120
What are you doing?

437
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,720
She's sleeping.

438
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,320
How can you be so shocked?

439
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I came down from the stairs.

440
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,520
Do you want to see if my cat is still alive?

441
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,120
How can a good cat die?

442
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,720
If you want to find a solution, please change it.

443
00:18:47,720 --> 00:19:06,280
You said you wanted to buy that

444
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
and made me a rabbit.

445
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,680
How is that possible?

446
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,280
You think I'm a big cat?

447
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,880
How...

448
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Anyway,

449
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,680
I saw Luo Mu's Western Little Fat.

450
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,680
Hello, Little Fat.

451
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,280
You're wrong.

452
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
We didn't do anything.

453
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,680
What are you going to do?

454
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Why are you in the living room?

455
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,280
I'll take care of you.

456
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
If you're not so fierce,

457
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
you're a little bit convinced.

458
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,680
Even I think you're protecting the whole world.

459
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
So you think

460
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,080
Little Fat thinks we're doing something?

461
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Brother Cheng.

462
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Today is the second day.

463
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
No training.

464
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
It was said that

465
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,080
everyone was fine today anyway.

466
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,080
Why don't we go to the flower bird fish market together?

467
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
Just a golden fish with you.

468
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,080
But I saw you didn't sleep last night

469
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,480
at the school's rehearsal.

470
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
I think it's okay.

471
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,280
Okay.

472
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,080
I'll change my clothes in the morning.

473
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Please like it.

474
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,880
Little Fat.

475
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,180
That's it?!

476
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,480
No need to ask.

477
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,280
Go, go.

478
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,680
What...

479
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Eighteen.

480
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,880
Watch, watch, watch.

481
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,520
Fatty, isn't the broadcast skills enough?

482
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,680
Enough.

483
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,800
What's enough? I think you're eating enough.

484
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,120
You're just wasting your salary.

485
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,240
What's this?

486
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,160
Miss is having a hard time with her meal today.

487
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,120
油 hot oil

488
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,600
Excuse me.

489
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,280
Do you even have to wear a pair of shoes

490
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,240
to pick a brand-sh jiangponey?

491
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,280
What's going on?

492
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,200
What's going on?

493
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Where did he find me?

494
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,520
Are you having tacos for nice market?

495
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,820

499
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,360

She looks so clear to make people confess.

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,900
Although she doesn't like无辞 in swimming,

509
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm so tired.

510
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,000
Stop.

511
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,520
Brother Cheng.

512
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,080
What?

513
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,600
Your necklace looks good.

514
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,720
Why don't you wear it on the ground?

515
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Who will you wear it on the ground?

516
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,280
Who will you wear it on the field?

517
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,560
You're wearing a dress.

518
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,600
Who will you wear it on?

519
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,280
Come on.

520
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,640
Since you're at this point

521
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm planning to sell the couple Zhen.

522
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,760
The couple Zhen will take thousands of Christmastime

523
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,960
to conquer a temple.

524
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,800
Your Там is like a ladder and has three layers.

525
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,520
No one dares to cross these steps.

526
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,800
OK, we're leaving.

527
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,360
Bye.

528
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,680

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,600
Safe.

530
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,400
What?

531
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Gao Genqi won't wear it.

532
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
What kind of a man is he?

533
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,800
Brother Cheng,

534
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
how many do you want?

535
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,600
Anything.

536
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
What color do you want?

537
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,800
Black.

538
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,200
How beautiful the red is.

539
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,800
Look at their tails.

540
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
They look like a little umbrella.

541
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,400
Really?

542
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,200
I want black.

543
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,600
How happy the red is.

544
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,800
Look at it.

545
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
I don't know how to jump.

546
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
It's 100 years old.

547
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,400
If I don't get

548
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
the fat cat's bite

549
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
for 100 years,

550
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I said it's black.

551
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,000
It's none of my business.

552
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I made my prediction.

553
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,400
You don't like red so much.

554
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,400
If you have the ability,

555
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,200
don't ask for it in the fire.

556
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,800
Give it to me.

557
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
How dare you touch my fire?

558
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,200
You're so capable.

559
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Why don't you let the game designer

560
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,600
design a black flag for you?

561
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,800
Just say you like it.

562
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
If you don't accept it,

563
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,000
I'll make it for you.

564
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,800
That's it.

565
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,800
You're so good.

566
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Brother Cheng,

567
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,800
if you want me to say it,

568
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,000
just listen to this little girl's words.

569
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,800
Why do you fight with your girlfriend?

570
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,000
They're angry.

571
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,600
It's a waste of time.

572
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
We're old friends.

573
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:55,800
Next month,

574
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
when you want to hold her hand and take a picture of her,

575
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,800
you'll regret it

576
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,400
when you're in a fight.

577
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,400
Boss,

578
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,600
you're wrong.

579
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
We're not that kind of relationship.

580
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
How much do you want?

581
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,000
One dollar.

582
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
One dollar.

583
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,600
Brother,

584
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,800
you're a man who drives a car.

585
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,600
You're talking about five cents with her.

586
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Don't you have any patience?

587
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,200
My wife is like your girlfriend.

588
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,400
Patience.

589
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,600
We're not that kind of...

590
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,000
Give me the money.

591
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,800
Fish.

592
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,600
Thank you.

593
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,600
Here you are.

594
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,600
Take care.

595
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,200
Good boy.

596
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,400
What are you looking at?

597
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,600
Let's go.

598
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This place has been here for three years.

599
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,600
If you want to die early,

600
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,000
let your dream be my dream again.

601
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,800
Boy,

602
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,000
you're always taking advantage of me.

603
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Let's go.

604
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,200
So cute.

605
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,600
Boss,

606
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,600
how much is it?

607
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,000
This hat is 3,500 yuan.

608
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,000
Did I do something wrong?

609
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,400
I still want to have a cat.

610
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,000
What a cute cat.

611
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,200
Is she still using it?

612
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,400
Brother, give me this.

613
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,800
I want this cat.

614
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,200
When you're not around,

615
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,800
can she stay with me?

616
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
I saw it first.

617
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,800
Let's go.

618
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,200
Okay.

619
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Is this person Chessman?

620
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,800
Yes.

621
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,200
Boss, how much is it?

622
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
I saw this cat first.

623
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,600
You have enough fat.

624
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,600
You want to keep it?

625
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
You have two cats.

626
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You're the third one.

627
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Where are the two cats?

628
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,000
You and the cat.

629
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,000
That cat is so cute.

630
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,800
Just like Big B's brother.

631
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,800
Wait.

632
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Isn't his girlfriend Nian Jiaqi?

633
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,000
That's just...

634
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,400
Maybe it's fans from DQ.

635
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Or staff.

636
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,600
What?

637
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
Pity.

638
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,800
You're so embarrassed.

639
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
First, Li Heng said that the back is Xu Tai Lun.

640
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
You didn't say anything.

641
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Shut up.

642
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,600
You never told me before.

643
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,000
Will you believe me?

644
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
You said I'm a man with no mouth and no tongue.

645
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,200
You're jealous.

646
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,800
I got it.

647
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,400
Please.

648
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm a little hungry. What do you want to eat?

649
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,800
Noodles.

650
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,800
Noodles?

651
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,400
Don't girls like to eat vegetables?

652
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Girls?

653
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,400
What is that?

654
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,000
I want noodles.

655
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,800
Hot soup, soup, meat, eggs.

656
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,600
If there's a kind of gender that loves noodles,

657
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm sure it's that gender.

658
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Are you embarrassed?

659
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You said you're a man with no mouth and no tongue.

660
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Okay.

661
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,200
I got it.

662
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
What do you want to do later?

663
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm on the ground.

664
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,600
There's no training today.

665
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,600
I don't want to play games.

666
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,200
Why don't we go watch a movie?

667
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
The ticket is ready.

668
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,000
You go with me.

669
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,000
Let's go.

670
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,000
Sorry.

671
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,600
What are you doing?

672
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,600
You're like a thief.

673
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,400
If I was found, I would...

674
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,600
I've already played the first three games in a row.

675
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm not used to being a public figure.

676
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I often have to be exposed to the public.

677
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
The first time I let you hide behind me,

678
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
I was just on the team.

679
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,600
The second time, I didn't get that good.

680
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,600
Why?

681
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
You have to learn to adapt yourself.

682
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You have to be the most basic.

683
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,600
You have to be a public figure.

684
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
You have to adapt yourself.

685
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,400
Isn't your education method a little bit too much?

686
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,400
Do it well.

687
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,000
You taught me this before.

688
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Even if you do it,

689
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,800
someone will discuss with you.

690
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Someone said you were fat in the live broadcast yesterday.

691
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,400
Really?

692
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,000
Look,

693
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,400
you're fat again.

694
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,400
You won't get hurt if you're fat.

695
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
When you do it someday,

696
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,400
tell them yourself

697
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,800
that you're fat too.

698
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It means you're fat.

699
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Why do I have to be so tired?

700
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,800
The crown of the jade belt is the most important.

701
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,400
The crown of the jade belt is the most important.

702
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
You brought the small cat in?

703
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,400
Yes.

704
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,000
It's cold in here.

705
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,000
The small cat is easy to get sick.

706
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,600
If you get sick,

707
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,400
it will be very troublesome to take care of you.

708
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,400
Watch a movie.

709
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,200
I want to find your dad.

710
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
I won't let him take my daughter away.

711
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,400
I'm afraid that his studies of medicine

712
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
will beights him and will not let him stop.

713
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,000
Xu Tai Long keeps fürging.

714
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I said there's no second time.

715
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Brother Cheng, are you having a date with Smelly?

716
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Why is she here?

717
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Or is your whole team here?

718
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Why are you hiding? Are you shy?

719
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh my god, are you really having a date?

720
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I didn't believe what I said at the beginning.

721
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Have you seen it?

722
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I really didn't believe it.

723
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Hello, everyone.

724
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm the middle-aged Smelly of GGDX.

725
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The standard is the word used in the interview of MVP interview.

726
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Stop laughing.

727
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
She's so cheeky.

728
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
She finally agreed to watch the movie with me.

729
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Brother Cheng, are you two the only ones?

730
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Yes.

731
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think it's time to say goodbye.

732
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I often see people discussing about you on the interview at the airport.

733
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So, are you really together?

734
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
We...

735
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We are a team of the harmonious couple.

736
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
We were born to watch the movie.

737
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
A team of the harmonious couple?

738
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You can't just leave me alone.

739
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You're a part of my life.

740
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm a part of your life.

741
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What are you doing today?

742
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm buying fish.

743
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Bought fish every day?

744
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You think I'm a fool?

745
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Oh, right.

746
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,160
I like black widow.

747
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,600
Can you steal it?

748
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,400
No.

749
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,520
Come on.

750
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,200
No.

751
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,760
Don't steal my private house.

752
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,440
Little cat?

753
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,320
Yes.

754
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
The fan sent it.

755
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,600
It's so cute.

756
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,640
Thank you.

757
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,920
I will take good care of it.

758
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
The cinema?

759
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,600
I saw the movie.

760
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,520
You must have recognized the wrong person.

761
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,120
I just took the little cat back to the base.

762
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,000
This afternoon,

763
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,760
he has been using the small number to play the game.

764
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,920
No.

765
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,040
You ask my teammate.

766
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,320
Yes.

767
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,920
He has been playing games in the base this afternoon.

768
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,880
Besides,

769
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,120
the cinema is so cold.

770
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
I think the little cat will catch a cold.

771
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
He will catch a cold.

772
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
I am not sure.

773
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,680
Little cat,

774
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,840
go and turn off the air conditioner in the base.

775
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,120
The little cat will catch a cold.

776
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,280
It will cool down.

777
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,200
It's okay.

778
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,240
I think the cold is more.

779
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,440
It's a little cold.

780
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,600
Isn't this the Xu Tai Lun of DQ5?

781
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,960
What are you looking at?

782
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,560
Next week, we will play a game with them.

783
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,560
We will know each other's tactics in advance.

784
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,400
What's wrong?

785
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
This Xu Tai Lun is so annoying.

786
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,200
He is not a good person.

787
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,120
I hate him.

788
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,160
There is nothing good about

789
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,440
the men in your team.

790
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,120
You are so smart.

791
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,040
Why do you care about me?

792
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,120
Sight is silent all the time.

793
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,040
Too lazy.

794
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,480
extraordinary talent.

795
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,280
he tells me everything at home.

796
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,720
Later,

797
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,740
suddenly,

798
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,580
The first called the team was đ perché

799
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,660
Dragon

800
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
likes to从 nrogen

801
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,480
You're a bad guy.

802
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,680
You're good at taking time off the job.

803
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,360
I went to buy some fish with Brother Cheng.

804
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,840
I went to the movies

805
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,320
as soon as I finished.

806
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,720
No one told me

807
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,200
that I could only watch the movie.

808
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,280
If there's really any problem,

809
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,280
who would go to the cinema

810
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
and wait for you to hang up?

811
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,840
As for the other team,

812
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
I don't know what's going on.

813
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,960
There are so many people in the cinema.

814
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,800
But

815
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,880
there are indeed a few people

816
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,280
who came in when the movie was on.

817
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
As for who,

818
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,640
why didn't you ask him

819
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
why you're so curious?

820
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Smiling is a good guy.

821
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,920
Why are you so nervous?

822
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,200
I think

823
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,720
he must have a leg with Cheng Kui.

824
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,680
Then, Brother Tai Lian is the one who's in the scene.

825
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,160
Dear Mr. Ping Anjing of the FIghting Battle,

826
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,480
and the audience of the viewers who are watching the live broadcast,

827
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,440
hello.

828
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,800
Welcome to

829
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,680
the FIghting Battle of 2020

830
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,560
professional league competition.

831
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
I'm the host, Xizhe.

832
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,800
Today's team is

833
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,800
ZGTX and DQFAN.

834
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,760
The strength of the two teams

835
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,640
can be said to be not very strong.

836
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,040
Who will be the winner?

837
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,480
Let's wait and see.

838
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,800
Another round of applause.

839
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,240
Welcome them.

840
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,400
Okay, please welcome the guest.

841
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,600
Welcome.

842
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,960
Everyone, be careful.

843
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,560
I think I'm a little nervous.

844
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,480
I don't know why.

845
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,440
Look who's nervous.

846
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,720
You're so cowardly.

847
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,400
Okay, now the two teams' true feelings are confirmed.

848
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,480
Let's look forward to the next battle.

849
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,880
What are they playing?

850
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,720
What are they doing?

851
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
I don't know.

852
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,480
Where can they have a meeting?

853
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,840
Come on, get ready to make a deal.

854
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,320
Okay.

855
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,880
Come on.

856
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,920
We're going to do something.

857
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,280
And the three teams are still not aware of it.

858
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,240
Okay, now.

859
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,040
Hurry up and get out.

860
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,880
The three teams are so strong.

861
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,720
The team is not in a hurry.

862
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,440
The three teams are very good.

863
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,880
Go, go, go.

864
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,760
Get the clothes.

865
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,480
Miss.

866
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,160
So cruel.

867
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,360
What's wrong with the five of them

868
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,480
playing in the middle of the night?

869
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,160
The whole team is playing in the middle of the night.

870
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,720
Is this a new battle?
