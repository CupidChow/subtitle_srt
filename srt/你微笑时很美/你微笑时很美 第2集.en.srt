00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,430
What?

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,580
A woman?

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,870
A woman is going to join Team ZGDX,

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,350
living and competing alongside my Cheng?

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,660
Is that for real?

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,630
It's really a woman?

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,880
Oh my goodness!

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,010
A woman playing professional esports?

9
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,530
Has Team ZGDX lost their minds?

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,990
They couldn't find anyone else,

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,790
so they just grabbed

12
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,430
some unknown small-time streamer

13
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,790
to take over Pro Ming's position?

14
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,030
And it's a woman?

15
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,960
ZGDX is going to lose all their fans

16
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,570
with this wild move.

17
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,570
Where is the base located?

18
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,770
I'm gonna raid it.

"China's top Tamamo-no-Mae player"?

20
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,409
Are you serious?

21
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,510
This Tong Yao is after my crush, Cheng, isn't she?

22
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,570
ZGDX must be desperate for attention.

23
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,690
A girl can be your mom.

24
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,950
Why can't she compete?

[Episode 2]

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,700
Hello?

28
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,810
Yao, look at these comments online.

29
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,970
These are outrageous.

30
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,020
It's okay.

31
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,979
I've seen it all before.

32
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,250
Don't stoop to their level.

33
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,180
I'm starving.

34
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,180
I haven't eaten anything on the way.

35
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,530
I just feel it's unfair to you.

36
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,220
I bet

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,140
none of the people criticizing you

38
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,570
could even beat you in the game.

39
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,130
Don't argue with them either.

40
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,590
Be careful not to be labeled as my fan leader.

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,950
So what if I'm labeled as your fan leader?

42
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,180
You're saving the fan leader position for someone else?

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,970
Miss Tong Yao,

44
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,380
let me know when you arrive at the base.

45
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,579
I'll come pick you up.

46
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,930
My wife has blocked me.

47
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,390
Can you help me talk to her?

48
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,700
Our team is right next to your ZGDX.

49
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,970
You really won't let me be your fan leader?

50
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,640
No,

51
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,030
it was Ai Jia who sent me a WeChat message.

52
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,340
He said their base is right next to ZGDX,

53
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,560
and he'll come pick me up.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,130
Be particularly attentive for no reason.

55
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,180
He mainly wants me to convince you

56
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,329
to unblock him on WeChat.

57
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,260
Stop right there.

58
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,930
I, Chen Jinyang, am a woman of my word.

59
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,130
Don't bother trying.

60
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,730
If you dare to help him,

61
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,980
you'll end up on my blacklist alongside him.

62
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,370
I wouldn't dare. I wouldn't.

63
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,329
But do you think my teammates

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,620
will welcome me joining?

65
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,530
Of course, they will.

66
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,260
We're all human beings.

67
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,000
Why should they be picky about you?

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
What era are we living in that there's still gender discrimination?

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,030
With you joining Team ZGDX,

70
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,330
they'll be so happy that they'll smile in their sleep.

71
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,330
Then tell me,

72
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,340
will they welcome our Pancake too?

73
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,610
Have you heard the story about the honest woodcutter and the golden axe?

74
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,700
Don't be too greedy in life.

75
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,220
Alright,

76
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,130
go enjoy your esports journey.

Bye-bye.

China's top Tamamo-no-Mae player joins Team ZGDX.

79
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,450
This marks the beginning of breaking traditional boundaries.

80
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,210
After North America's milestone of

81
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,220
having its first female pro player reach the finals,

82
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,230
the Chinese region's Team ZGDX quickly followed suit.

83
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,020
The Esports Farm also reposted this.

84
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,060
What's Tong Yao's background anyway?

85
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,829
What makes her qualified to take Pro Ming's place?

86
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:48,829
Team ZGDX spent a lot of time and effort

87
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,610
to persuade Smiling

88
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,700
to join as the first female pro player

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,270
in the Chinese region since the start of

90
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,790
Onmyoji Arena competitions,

91
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,970
promising her a starting player position.

92
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,050
K, look.

93
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,900
Our team actually got a woman as the starting player.

94
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,860
We're doomed.

95
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,270
Smiling states

96
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,650
that being a pro player has nothing to do with gender.

97
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,170
She doesn't really understand

98
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,170
why it's always been men at the top of this game before.

99
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,050
And she bluntly said

100
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,650
if girls really want to do it,

101
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,060
they won't be bad at it either.

102
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,260
Can you give it a rest?

103
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,410
Is the new mid laner your relative or something?

104
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,410
Stop talking so much.

105
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,820
She's not your enemy either.

106
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,730
Who are you being so harsh to?

107
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,780
Shut up. You're giving me a headache.

108
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,420
Cheng?

109
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,810
Captain?

110
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,030
My core-positioned boss,

111
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,740
this girl is our new mid laner.

112
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,840
You should show some concern.

113
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,240
She may report for duty tomorrow, you know.

114
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,220
I heard she's bringing a furry little beast with her.

115
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,520
It could be the takeout I ordered.

116
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,120
Could you please open the door for me, Captain?

117
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,850
K, what are you doing?

118
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,070
Commenting with your alt account.

119
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,400
I don't like her either.

120
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,620
Lu Sicheng, why are you the one opening the door?

121
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,620
-Thank you.
-I...

122
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,580
I'm Tong Yao.

123
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,850
I'm so hungry.

124
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,540
Cheng, don't you want another round?

125
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,010
Random matches are too frustrating.

126
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,500
Can't stand carrying those leeches for free.

127
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,780
They're giving away more kills than I can score.

128
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,650
Cheng is in a bad mood today.

129
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,940
Cheng,

130
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,410
I advise you to suck it up.

131
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,210
The performance review is the day after tomorrow.

132
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,810
If you don't want your salary deducted,

133
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,130
you still need to earn at least 100 more victory points

134
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,450
plus three promotion matches.

135
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,530
Our Cheng is done for.

136
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
It's no use trying at this point.

137
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,460
Drop one tier,

138
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,900
and 20% of the monthly salary will be deducted.

139
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,460
Ever since this rule came out,

140
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,890
Cheng has never received

141
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,020
a full salary again.

142
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,260
Cheng, let's not be willful anymore.

143
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,380
Being willful costs money, you know.

144
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,490
It's fine. Our Cheng is rich.

145
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,900
Wait, Cheng,

146
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,780
this isn't the takeout I ordered.

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,130
I arrived at the ZGDX's base to report in and knocked on the door.

148
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,620
It was Cheng who came to open the door.

149
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,200
Then he took my takeout,

150
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,430
said, "Thank you," and closed the door.

151
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,180
So, now I'm standing in front of the door again.

152
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,130
Along with my Pancake.

153
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,240
LOL.

154
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,710
Cheng mistook Tong Yao for a delivery girl.

155
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,260
Delete that Weibo post.

156
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,770
No.

157
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,060
Delete that Weibo post.

158
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,730
I won't.

159
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,220
I'll say it one last time: delete that Weibo post.

160
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,420
You apologize first.

161
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,940
Never in my life have I seen anyone talk back to Cheng like this before.

162
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,090
Thumbs up for the new girl.

163
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,940
Yeah, impressive, impressive.

164
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,890
Everyone's so diligent today, huh?

165
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,980
The meeting's over before I even arrived.

166
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,420
Rui, I'm here to report in.

167
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,150
You're here.

168
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,090
Let me formally introduce her to you.

169
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,140
This is Tong Yao,

170
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,330
the legendary player who reached No. 1 on the national server at 19

171
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,450
and became the Lord of Heian-kyo on the Korean server in solo queue at 21,

172
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,350
outperforming 99% of male players,

173
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,420
the girl genius mid laner.

174
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,950
Stop reading from a script.

175
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,700
That's too much, Rui.

176
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,420
Anyway,

177
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,740
starting today, Tong Yao will officially replace Pro Ming

178
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,500
as our new contracted mid laner.

179
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,060
Welcome.

180
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,410
Even though you may already know everyone,

181
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,650
I'll still introduce them to you.

182
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,220
This is our top laner, Cat.

183
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,060
In game, he

184
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,330
-can tank so well that the enemy
-Nice to meet you.

185
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,010
squishies tremble, a gym-loving straight guy.

186
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,410
Welcome, welcome.

187
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,410
He's just a bit slow to catch on.

188
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,670
Don't mind it too much.

189
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,860
Slow to catch on? Who are you talking about?

190
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,380
Sorry, I've been working out a lot lately.

191
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,130
It's okay. It's okay.

192
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,140
This is our support.

193
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,050
You can call him Pang.

194
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,970
He's the team's healer.

195
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,100
A pure and harmless, chubby homebody.

196
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,330
You can call me a homebody,

197
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,570
but calling me chubby is going too far.

198
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,250
I'm just well-built. That's all.

199
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,180
Hello, Miss.

200
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,250
Don't come to me if you need anything,

201
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,940
but we can duo queue together when you're free.

202
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,050
No problem, no problem.

203
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,460
That one over there is K.

204
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,270
He's our jungler.

205
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,210
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

206
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,420
He's really just going through his chunibyo phase.

207
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,930
With him around,

208
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,540
Pro Ming could strut

209
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,380
fearlessly in front of the enemy mid laner.

210
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,040
That was because Pro Ming was there.

211
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,460
If it were someone else,

212
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,010
it might not be the case.

213
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,010
Next up,

214
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,500
I probably don't need to introduce this person, right?

215
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,180
ADC.

216
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,930
I heard you left her outside the door earlier.

217
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,250
I thought she was a delivery girl.

218
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,570
Would a delivery person be dressed like that

219
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,290
and carrying a cat?

220
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:13,950
They could.

221
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,740
That's why I closed the door.

222
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,820
I'm sorry I didn't dress up for the occasion.

223
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,290
How mean.

224
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,850
Even controlling what others wear.

225
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,220
What do you want to say?

226
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,070
I didn't say anything.

227
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,170
Your expression tells me

228
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,900
that you have something to say.

229
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,460
You have to control what everyone thinks?

230
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,049
What a scary persona.

231
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,080
Oh, let me introduce my cat.

232
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,909
This is my cat, Pancake.

233
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,940
So?

234
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,010
So, can I call you Cheng?

235
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,940
What does your cat's name, Pancake,

236
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,070
have to do with you calling me "Cheng"?

237
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,720
These are two separate questions.

238
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,120
Keep a close eye on your furry little beast.

239
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,250
I asked Rui already.

240
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,170
No one at the base is allergic to cat hair.

241
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,380
That's why I brought it here.

242
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,980
There are.

243
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,100
Who?

244
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,610
My sons.

245
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,520
[Si, Cheng, Sicheng]

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Cheng, this isn't about allergies.

247
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,960
This is about the food chain.

248
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,610
You can't suppress a little cat's natural instincts.

249
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,540
What if her cat eats my sons?

250
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,570
Just buy some more.

251
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,630
Can't you afford it?

252
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,920
If you lost fewer games and got fined less often,

253
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,980
you could have a whole family of them.

254
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,330
Don't worry, Cheng.

255
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,850
I'll definitely keep a close eye on Pancake.

256
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,650
I guarantee you'll have a tankful of descendants.

257
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,640
Alright, alright, alright.

258
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,900
If we keep talking, Cheng is going to get angry.

259
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,290
Let's go, girl.

260
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,580
Let me show you to your room.

261
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,000
-Okay.
-Let's go.

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,770
I'll leave it to you, Pang.

263
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,820
Got it.

264
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,220
What are you laughing at?

265
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,880
"A tankful of descendants," you guys just said.

266
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,070
Isn't it funny?

267
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,260
Take a look.

268
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,140
How is it?

269
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,240
I carefully decorated all of this.

270
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,970
You could tell with a glance that Rui's previous room decoration

271
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,530
was clearly done by a guy.

272
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,010
What do you think of mine?

273
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,460
I specifically searched online

274
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,290
and selected this girl-only style for you.

275
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,810
Girl-only style?

276
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,180
You seem to have some misunderstandings about girls, bro.

277
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,850
Girl,

278
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,410
look at this.

279
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,170
I searched through hundreds of stores

280
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,940
to find this kind of

281
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,020
four-piece bedding set with pink lace

282
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,540
and floral edges.

283
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,070
-Pretty, right?
-The lace and the pink color.

284
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,800
Did Peppa Pig eat these and then spit them out?

285
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,860
And this.

286
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,810
Look at this.

287
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,230
How flowy it is.

288
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,940
Please, blind me now.

289
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,170
Now look at this.

290
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,370
The girl's tender-style flamingo.

291
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,910
How romantic.

292
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,780
Girl,

293
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,040
how does it look? Pretty, right?

294
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,690
Pretty.

295
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,810
I knew it.

296
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,770
You're the first professional female player,

297
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,060
and you joined our team.

298
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
It's an honor.

299
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,090
So we need to take good care of you

300
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,890
and give you special attention.

301
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,010
Alright,

302
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,690
I think it's tired too.

303
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,460
So you can take your time to settle in

304
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,120
and get some rest early.

305
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,650
I won't bother you anymore.

306
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,330
By the way,

307
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,540
I've left a team handbook on the desk for you.

308
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,040
But it's okay if you don't read it.

309
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,960
Tomorrow, Rui

310
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,090
will help you get familiar with the daily training routine.

311
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:21,620
Bye-bye.

312
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,770
Bye-bye.

313
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,100
Girl,

314
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,540
welcome to Team ZGDX.

315
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,370
Good luck.

316
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:32,940
Bye-bye.

317
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,340
First day on the team:

318
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,580
cool Cheng,

319
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,900
warm teammates,

320
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,570
and a surprising bedroom.

321
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,570
Lol.

322
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,650
I'm actually quite happy.

323
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,690
Smiling, go for it!

324
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,560
Dad, Mom, I've arrived at the base!

325
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,640
Sending love!

326
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,000
[Mother changed the name of the WeChat group to "Unhappy Family"]

327
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,060
Can the door be locked from the inside? Take a photo and show me.

328
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,030
Yes, yes, yes.

329
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,300
This is a proper training base.

330
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,280
Take a photo of the door lock.

331
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,450
Yao, how's your room?

332
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,210
Dad,

333
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,410
it's really nice here.

334
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,210
Look.

335
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,220
This is the room that my teammates decorated for me.

336
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,740
Although...

337
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,250
But...

338
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,560
but they put a lot of thought into it.

339
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,240
The door looks quite secure.

340
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,930
Why do I feel that the window...

341
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
is not very secure?

342
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,660
Enough, Dad.

343
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,820
What's so insecure about this window?

344
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,900
Why don't you just come and seal the window for me?

345
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,650
I'm here for the esports.

346
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,170
It's not like I'm here for some top-secret work.

347
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:57,830
Look at you.

348
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,630
I'm just worried about you.

349
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,450
I care about your safety.

350
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,740
I haven't even finished my sentence,

351
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,300
and you've already fired back several responses.

352
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Your personality

353
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,170
is just like your mother's.

354
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,730
Don't drag me into this.

355
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,130
Her impulsive nature doesn't come from me.

356
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,650
Dad,

357
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,290
Mom's still angry?

358
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,860
She's been angry all day.

359
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,860
She didn't even cook for me.

360
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,060
Don't talk nonsense.

361
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,090
Didn't you have the porridge?

362
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,090
Did a ghost eat it?

363
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,970
Wasn't that yesterday's leftovers?

364
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,770
Leftover from yesterday isn't porridge anymore?

365
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,780
Besides,

366
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,720
why was there porridge left yesterday?

367
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,520
Let me ask you.

368
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,780
Isn't that because of your precious daughter?

369
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,440
Your precious daughter who left without a word!

370
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,210
Alright, she's already gone.

371
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,130
Why are you still talking about this?

372
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,290
Why can't I talk about it?

373
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,290
I'm her mother.

374
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,460
Why can't I say anything?

375
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,390
If I have to say it, it's your fault.

376
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,940
Why did you let her go?

377
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,970
She could've had that banking job.

378
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,290
We even found her an internship.

379
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,600
We had already spoken to the right person.

380
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,440
He asked me,

381
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,630
"What is your daughter doing?"

382
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,370
She went to play video games.

383
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,980
A proper college graduate,

384
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,610
why come to play video games?

385
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,820
Yes, yes, yes.

386
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,770
Why are you saying this when your daughter calls back?

387
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,880
She's still young, and her mind's not set.

388
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,410
It's normal if she wants to try something new.

389
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,090
If she really wants to try,

390
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,730
we should let her.

391
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,560
She might come back in two or three months.

392
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,050
Right, Yao?

393
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,350
-Dad...
-Besides,

394
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,510
our family isn't short of

395
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,820
-her two- or three-month salary.
-Mom...

396
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,210
Have you lost your mind?

397
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,720
It's so hard to find a proper job these days.

398
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
You know that.

399
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,900
And Yao,

400
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,740
Yao, you're a fresh graduate.

401
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,650
Do you know?

402
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,250
Do you know how important the first job is for her?

403
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,130
Gaming,

404
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,610
is gaming even a real career?

405
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,100
Does it offer social insurance and the housing fund?

406
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,040
Social insurance and the housing fund, it has all of that.

407
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,610
See?

408
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,580
It does.

409
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,760
It does.

410
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,780
-I'm not as good as you.
-Mom.

411
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,170
Well...

412
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,690
I'm not good at raising children, okay?

413
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,100
Come on, come on.

414
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,360
Where are you going?

415
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,300
Why are you taking your phone with you?

416
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,610
I want to talk to Yao a bit more.

417
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,260
Talk, talk, what's there to talk about?

418
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,140
I want to say something important.

419
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,410
It's all because she has a father like you.

420
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,440
What important things do you have to talk to her about?

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
Every time I say one thing, you say the opposite.

422
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,370
I say one thing, and you say the opposite.

423
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,030
Yao has been spoiled by you since she was little.

424
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Pancake,

425
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,770
the official training starts tomorrow.

426
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,430
Are you looking forward to it?

427
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,220
Wake up at 8:30 AM.

428
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,340
Physical training at 9:00 AM.

429
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,040
No laughing, goofing off, or slacking during training.

430
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Violators will be fined 1,000 yuan.

431
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:06,810
Morning.

432
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,500
Why isn't there even breakfast?

433
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,280
W-who are you?

434
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,020
Little girl,

435
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,390
who are you?

436
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,890
I just arrived yesterday.

437
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,670
Listen, little girl,

438
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,080
don't think I'm nagging.

439
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,890
I advise you

440
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,540
to pack your things and leave quickly.

441
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,410
This team has a rule.

442
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,620
Girlfriends are not allowed here.

443
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,930
Last time, one of them brought his girlfriend here,

444
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,160
and he ended up having half a month's salary docked.

445
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,630
Girlfriend?

446
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,930
No, no, Auntie,

447
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,000
you've got it wrong.

448
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,530
I'm not anyone's girlfriend.

449
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,530
I'm a new professional player who has just joined the team.

450
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,410
Player?

451
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
A female?

452
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Yes, I'm a female.

453
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,190
Auntie,

454
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,040
are you preparing breakfast?

455
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,100
These are all the ingredients for lunch.

456
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,870
Lunch?

457
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,860
Aren't we supposed to wake up at 8:30 in the morning?

458
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,810
8:30?

459
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,860
These kids work very hard.

460
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,470
They trained until very late last night.

461
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,550
It'd be good if they can get up by 12:30 today.

462
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,660
For esports players, there's no such thing as morning.

463
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,610
I suggest that you

464
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,800
go get some rest too.

465
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,770
They'll play games with you in the afternoon.

466
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:38,890
Auntie,

467
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,690
such a big base,

468
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,540
do you clean it all by yourself?

469
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,060
I usually just cook and do some cleaning.

470
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,960
For professional work like cleaning appliances,

471
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,020
they hire people online to do that.

472
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,800
Now, even young girls are into esports.

473
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,360
Congratulations to Team ZGDX for winning

474
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,400
the Spring Season Championship

475
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,620
of the "2019 Onmyoji Professional League"!

476
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,550
At the same time,

477
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,250
let's also congratulate Lu Sicheng, Chessman,

478
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,690
for winning the MVP of this match!

479
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:37,810
Morning.

480
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,770
Morning.

481
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,220
Nice Superman underwear.

482
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,140
What's for breakfast?

483
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,720
The usual, I guess.

484
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,550
Morning.

485
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:01,740
Morning.

486
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,330
Morning.

487
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,770
Morning.

488
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,510
Morning, Cheng.

489
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,840
Morning.

490
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,760
-Oh my God.
-Why is he running away?

491
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,370
Exciting.

492
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,080
What do you think?

493
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,600
So exciting.

494
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,400
Where is everyone?

495
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,640
Come on.

496
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,970
Pro Ming, you're back.

497
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,340
What did the doctor say?

498
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,170
Nothing much.

499
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,950
Hello, Tong Yao.

500
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,960
Hello, Pro Ming.

501
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,670
Is your hand any better?

502
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,940
Much better.

503
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,900
Enough pleasantries. Let's get down to business.

504
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,010
Although Pro Ming has retired,

505
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,570
he won't be leaving us.

506
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,830
Starting today,

507
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,690
he will officially become

508
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,180
the coach of our Team ZGDX.

509
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,890
I knew it.

510
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,020
Our Pro Ming couldn't bear to leave us.

511
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,140
You're back.

512
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,740
I never left.

513
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,400
Pro Ming.

514
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,080
I still miss the days when you played mid lane.

515
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,560
Now our mid laner is Tong Yao.

516
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,580
I'll definitely work hard.

517
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,900
The National League is coming up soon.

518
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,230
I will work with Pro Ming

519
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,440
to oversee your training,

520
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,810
make sure you balance training and rest, and maintain a regular schedule.

521
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,570
Starting tomorrow,

522
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,680
no one is allowed to sleep in.

523
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,240
You must go to bed early and wake up early.

524
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,500
Get up early to watch "The Untamed," huh?

525
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,350
I...

526
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,100
I didn't know we weren't allowed to watch dramas at the base.

527
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,210
No one said you can't watch.

528
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,680
You're free to do what you want during breaks.

529
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,030
Right, K?

530
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,950
Ridiculous.

531
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,690
K?

532
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,980
I'll go talk to him.

533
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,020
Don't take it personally.

534
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,680
Pro Ming was this team's mid laner since forever.

535
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,300
He was also with the team the longest.

536
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,210
So when he retired,

537
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,860
we were all pretty upset.

538
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,820
Especially K,

539
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,050
he was recruited by Pro Ming,

540
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,290
and he only listens to Pro Ming.

541
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,690
So since Pro Ming's retirement,

542
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,060
he's been acting like he's on his period,

543
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,110
throwing tantrums.

544
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,030
Alright, everyone, get to training now.

545
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,380
Miss, come with me for a moment.

546
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,860
Okay.

547
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,700
-Let's go.
-Perfect.

548
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,590
You...

549
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,240
Come on.

550
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,560
How's your first day going, Miss?

551
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,860
Not bad.

552
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,740
It's just that Pang's Superman underwear

553
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,060
and Cheng's bathrobe play

554
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,210
blinded me.

555
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,100
I didn't expect that when I wasn't around,

556
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,700
they'd be having so much fun.

557
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,800
You can take a closer look at that team handbook.

558
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,260
It has all our team's rules and regulations.

559
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,770
Also, the club has a rule

560
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,890
that each team member

561
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,620
must stream for 45 hours each month

562
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,040
to meet the streaming KPI targets.

563
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,230
This is the contract. Take a look at it first.

564
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,830
By the way,

565
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,320
which platform were you streaming on before?

566
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,190
You weren't signed, were you?

567
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,950
Star Fan.

568
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,010
But I haven't signed a contract with the platform.

569
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,250
Oh, right,

570
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,340
I've never shown my face while streaming before.

571
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,090
So I want to ask,

572
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,060
is it okay to stream while wearing a mask?

573
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,330
Wear a mask? Why?

574
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,240
Wearing a mask while streaming makes me feel more secure.

575
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,700
Who are you trying to fool?

576
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,100
Fine, you can stream with a mask on if you want.

577
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,830
But when the new season starts,

578
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,460
and when taking promo shots for the new season,

579
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,570
you'll wear a mask too?

580
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,760
At that time, people will definitely say,

581
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,330
"We don't know if this girl is here to play professionally

582
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,180
or to act in some

583
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,620
urban supernatural Slit-Mouthed Woman story."

584
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,820
People will see you eventually anyway,

585
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,020
so why bother hiding?

586
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,810
Besides,

587
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,010
this is work.

588
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,360
You need to have the courage to face your fans directly.

589
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,920
Alright, alright, alright.

590
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,580
Okay.

591
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,410
Here, this is for you.

592
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,980
Let's go downstairs.

593
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,490
Okay.

594
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,280
Let's go.

595
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,220
Let me tell you something.

596
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,360
Our team actually has great potential.

597
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,160
You probably don't know, but beyond our seasonal performance,

598
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,420
our team is quite popular too.

599
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,250
Look, these facilities and equipment are all top-notch.

600
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,110
That's enough.

601
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:33,770
Rui.

602
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,370
Arrange for someone later

603
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,100
to take her to the supermarket.

604
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,800
Indeed.

605
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,430
It's her first day here.

606
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,300
She'll definitely need to buy some daily necessities and such.

607
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,210
I would've forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it.

608
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,500
I indeed should have made arrangements.

609
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,180
Cheng, why don't you take her?

610
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,050
I remember telling you

611
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,600
to arrange for someone to do it.

612
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,800
Yeah, and I've arranged for you, Cheng.

613
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,830
I'm very busy.

614
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,020
Busy losing points?

615
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,370
You're already at the Challenger rank, buddy.

616
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,450
That's why I'm busy.

617
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,850
The end-of-month assessment is in a couple of days.

618
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,320
From Challenger to Lord of Heian-kyo in two days,

619
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,120
Cheng, do you think you're some sort of gaming god?

620
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,060
Let's go.

621
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,480
-Bye. Come back early.
-Bye, Rui.

622
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,610
Come on, let's duo queue.

623
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,800
Wait for me, Cheng.

624
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,580
Can I call you "Cheng"?

625
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,190
You might as well call me "Dad."

626
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,550
I suggest you act like a decent person.

627
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,890
Haven't you already been calling me that, Shorty?

628
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,420
Hurry up.

629
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,390
Wait.

630
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,020
Who are you calling "Shorty?"

631
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,420
We're just strangers meeting each other.

632
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,840
I advise you to be a bit kinder, okay?

633
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,050
What's with the hostility?

634
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,720
Because I never thought

635
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,430
my future teammate would be underage.

636
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,750
I'm 22. I've already graduated from college.

637
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,580
Your height tells me you're lying.

638
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,690
Delete that Weibo post.

639
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,360
I won't.

640
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,170
You locked me out first.

641
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,360
And you called me short.

642
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,290
I'll pin that post to my Weibo page.

643

647
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,460
Tong Yao, you didn't even tell me you were here.

648
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,020
It was your ex-girlfriend who ordered me not to contact you.

649
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,980
You two know each other?

650
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,560
We went to the same university.

651
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,730
He was three years ahead of me in college.

652
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,930
His mom was my teacher.

653
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,000
His ex-girlfriend is my best friend.

654

Did I ask you for all of these details?

656
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,300
Is this...

00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,500

Cheng,

662
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,680
you can put away that long face now.

663
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,780

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,730
Sure, sure.

669
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,550
Stop trying to corrupt us with food.

00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,480
Once our new player arrives,

675
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,560
I'll schedule it with Rui.

676
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,970
Looks like you've got a new foreign player.

677
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,170
What's his position?

678
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,110
ADC.

679
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,670
Wait for the official announcement. It's going to be big news.

680
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,040
Who is it?

681
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,280
I don't know.

682
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,110
Miss Tong Yao.

683
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,280
Could you put in a good word for me with your best friend?

684
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,820
At least let her get me off her blacklist.

685
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,950
Or just tell me why she broke up with me.

686
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,630
I can only tell you

687
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,030
that your ex-girlfriend

688
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,100
turned down three overseas admission offers to come back.

689
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,080
And all you cared about was

690
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,940
how many virtual gifts you got from livestreaming.

691
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,460
Shorty, get in the car.

692
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,690
Oh my God.

693
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,370
Do all pro players drive this kind of car?

694
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,770
What?

695
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,130
Are you so used to Didi VIP rides

696
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,040
that you can't open the door yourself?

697
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,590
No, no, I can do it myself.

698
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,060
Cheng, I'm just going to buy some slippers

699
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,300
and daily toiletries.

700
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,230
Any nearby mall will do.

701
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,560
What else? Take you to a furniture market?

702
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,270
Really?

703
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
You miss me?

704
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,820
Did you miss me pinning you against the water cooler

705
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,480
and watching me bring back trophy after trophy?

706
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,450
Keep dreaming.

707
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,310
During the Spring Season Finals a couple of days ago,

708
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,840
Rui said you were there too.

709
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,480
Yes.

710
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,850
You stayed at the same hotel as us?

711
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,410
Yes.

712
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,260
On the 46th floor?

713
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,900
Yes...

714
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,150
No.

715
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,360
So that stubborn short person from that day was you after all.

716
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,150
It wasn't me.

717
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,570
Stubbornly refusing to admit you're short

718
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,940
and stubbornly refusing to admit that it was you.

719
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,860
No, Cheng, listen to me.

720
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,160
That day, it wasn't that I couldn't reach.

721
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,270
I was carrying too many things, and my hands were full.

722
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,200
That's why I...

723
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:43,970
Stubborn.

724
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,130
I'm starting to dislike you.

725
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,450
You think that intimidates me?

726
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,960
So mean.

727
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,220
Hurry up.

728
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,560
Cheng, which pair looks better?

729
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,710
The blue one.

730
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,690
I remember I just said blue.

731
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,310
The aesthetic taste of the romantically clueless men is only for elimination.

732
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,750
Like Pang, for example.

733
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,160
Just buy everything at once.

734
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,340
Don't act like you're performing acrobatics.

735
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,490
You were practically hanging off the shelf just now.

736
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,760
It's not my fault.

737
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,720
There's only one pink pair left.

738
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,340
I just managed to get it down.

739
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,250
-But you...
-So the person

740
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,850
who hid the water secretly

741
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,320
was you.

742
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,840
What do you mean?

743
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,500
How would you know?

744
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,370
You were that water thief.

745
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,250
What water thief?

746
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,240
Was your name written on it?

747
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,400
I saw it first, and I hid it.

748
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,250
You called that "hiding?"

749
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,430
What else would you call it?

750
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,900
Hiding things in the supermarket, are you a child?

751
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,360
I was afraid someone else would buy it first.

752
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,260
During those days,

753
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,750
I thought I was being surrounded by a bunch of short zombies.

754
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,030
Turns out it was the same person.

755
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,010
What short zombie siege?

756
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,500
Captain, speak properly.

757
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,580
So what if you have long legs? Walking so fast.

758
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,240
What's with the beauty camera?

759
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,170
For livestreaming.

760
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,810
Rui talked to you today

761
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,690
about the streaming KPIs, right?

762
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,810
You didn't try to bargain with him?

763
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,690
Using the excuse that girls need to sleep and wake up early

764
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,400
to get him to reduce your monthly streaming hours by ten?

765
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,430
What's the difference

766
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,410
between 45 hours and 35 hours?

767
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,050
You'll see the difference when you need to

768
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,050
catch up on your streaming hours at the end of the month.

769
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,220
What do you mean?

770
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,990
It's like cramming your summer homework

771
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,840
the night before kindergarten starts.

772
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,180
Who are you calling a kindergartner?

773
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,120
Can't you talk properly?

774
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,520
It's a warning from your senior.

775
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,500
I'll only do this kind of good deed

776
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,900
once in my life.

777
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,250
It's him, isn't it?

778
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,290
Isn't that Cheng? Cheng.

779
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,400
Why are you running?

780
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Your fans are taking photos.

781
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,639
So what if they're taking photos?

782
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,909
I haven't even done my makeup properly today. How can I face them?

783
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,090
And I haven't posted any photos online yet.

784
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:25,969
Do you think your fans

785
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,699
would be kind enough to use a beauty filter for me?

786
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,110
They're coming over.

787
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,370
Block me. Don't let them see me.

788
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,690
I can block their view vertically, but horizontally might be tricky.

789
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,540
Cheng, I'm so happy to see you here.

790
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,880
Could you sign an autograph for me?

791
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,469
Cheng, how's Pro Ming's hand?

792
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,139
I saw the official announcement saying his hand is undergoing treatment.

793
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,820
Is that true?

794
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,290
Cheng, you're so tall in person,

795
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,139
even taller than when I saw you on the field.

796
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:44,800
I'm doomed.

797
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,980
Am I going to be exposed?

798
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,690
Cheng,

799
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,170
-Is she your girlfriend?
-She saw me.

800
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,330
-What should I do?
-No.

801
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,260
Where would I find a girlfriend who looks like my daughter?

802
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,560
She's a staff member of the team,

803
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,020
helping me buy some stuff.

804
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,150
Miss, you're so cute.

805
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,100
She's immature.

806
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,650
Miss, could you take a photo of me with Cheng?

807
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,850
I want one too. Me too.

808
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,310
Thank you, Cheng.

809
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,020
-My turn, my turn.
-I want a photo too.

810
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,470
Thanks, Cheng.

811
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,260
Thank you, Cheng.

812
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,540
-Thank you, Miss.
-You're welcome.

813
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,000
-Bye-bye, Cheng.
-We're leaving. Bye-bye.

814
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,250
So cool. I can't believe I met him in person.

815
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:30,810
Bye-bye.

816
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,090
Let's go.

817
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,530
He's so handsome.

818
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,200
What's that expression on your face?

819
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,270
Cheng.

820
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,330
Do you think I'll have this many fans in the future?

821
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,820
Will they like me this much too

822
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,460
and rush to take photos with me?

823
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,410
The prerequisite is that you make it to the finals.

824
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,690
If the team's performance drops

825
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,740
because they signed you,

826
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,610
then there will be thousands of times more people

827
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,180
coming after you online.

828
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,250
They'll ask daily if you've choked to death on water

829
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,070
or why the wind hasn't blown you away.

830
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,160
They'll rush to hang you out to dry.

831
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,650
Just like K?

832
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,930
Does that bother you?

833
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,450
Honestly?

834
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,500
If it bothers you, then play well in the matches.

835
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,830
In the world of esports,

836
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,850
only the strong gain recognition.

837
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,760
As a newcomer,

838
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,460
you're bound to face a lot of criticism.

839
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,900
But if you prove with your skills

840
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,150
that you can replace Pro Ming,

841
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,650
no one will say a word against you.

842
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,530
But Cheng,

843
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,910
how come it seems like no one has ever doubted you?

844
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,000
Because I'm strong.

845
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,680
In esports, being bad at the game is the original sin.

846
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,210
Let's go.

847
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,750
[Exit]

848
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:46,350
[Exit]

849
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,730
K, go to the mid lane.

850
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:48,810
This way, come this way.

851
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,340
That corner.

852
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,870
What the hell are you doing?

853
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,050
You're back.

854
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,450
Looks like our Cheng is getting along well

855
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,350
with our new teammate.

856
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:02,950
Yes.

857
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,850
a father taking his kindergarten daughter

858
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,360
shopping for snacks before a school trip.

859
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,990
Tong Yao,

860
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,270
you'll sit here from now on.

861
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,250
Isn't this where you used to sit?

862
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,350
Is it appropriate?

863
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,700
It's fine.

864
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,500
Mid laners have traditionally always sat in this position.

865
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,020
See,

866
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,940
this is the latest gaming chair I got for you

867
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,540
according to Pang's instructions.

868
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,510
It's the top of the line.

869
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,230
You can adjust it

870
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,810
according to your personal preferences.

871
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,440
Try it out.

872
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,780
I guarantee you won't feel tired even after ranking up all day.

873
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,340
Good luck, girl.

874
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,800
What's the use of just cheering?

875
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,580
We have practice matches coming up in a few days.

876
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,870
Whether she stays or not

877
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,810
will depend on her performance in the first game.

878
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,880
Tong Yao, don't be nervous.

879
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,540
Cheng has always been this...

880
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,020
strict.

881
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,710
What is this?

882
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,610
It's a pink decoration only for girls.

883
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,510
Take it off.

884
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,810
It's an eyesore next to me.

885
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,810
If I drop a rank, it's on you?

886
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,600
This is my handpicked selection.

887
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,230
She likes this decoration. I won't take it away.

888
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,890
You like it?

889
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,860
This floral border is indeed blocking my view a bit.

890
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,690
Girl,

891
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,460
don't let yourself be oppressed by tyranny.

892
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,860
Speak your mind loudly.

893
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,890
Not all girls like pink, you know.

894
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,300
I'm just not into the whole girly thing.

895
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,050
Didn't you just buy a pair of pink slippers?

896
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,620
Cheng, I advise you to be kind.

897
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,680
This is the terrible aesthetic of romantically clueless men.

898
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,320
Shut up.

899
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:25,840
What's wrong?

900
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,640
Stay out of it.

901
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,230
Girl, want to duo queue?
