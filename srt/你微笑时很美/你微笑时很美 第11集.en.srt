1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,490
Look at me.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,070
I rushed over immediately when I noticed you were in danger.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,060
You'll never change.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,910
Come, watch me challenge him.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,900
I'll challenge him. Challenge!

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,830
I died.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,660
Challenge him. Keep going!

8
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,150
You don't love me anymore.

9
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,070
Be careful, be careful.

10
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,750
The enemy jungler is heading to your side.

11
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,630
Damn, damn, damn.

12
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,550
Who are you cursing at?

13
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,590
I said damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.

14
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,420
Damn it, I died again.

15
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,030
I...

16
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,330
You dare to ambush me?

17
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,890
I'll let you ambush me.

18
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,100
You dare to ambush your chubby grandpa here?

19
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,500
Let me show you how charming I am.

20
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,830
Holy meow!

21
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,670
Attack, attack, attack!

22
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,200
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick! One wave! Beautiful!

23
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,230
One wave! We're close to finishing!

24
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,100
All in, all in, all in! We can kill, we can kill.

25
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,190
Let's finish this and go eat.

26
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,060
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack!

27
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,830
Get hyped!

28
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,810
Let's go! Where's Cheng?

29
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,900
Cheng, where did you go?

30
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,180
Cheng, Cheng! Beautiful!

31
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,750
Cheng, why aren't you talking?

32
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,290
As expected from the preschool class.

33
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,490
My head is exploding.

34
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,450
I want to take a dump.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,100
[Falling into your smile]

36
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,860
[Episode 11]

37
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,420
Alright, both sides' minion waves have been deployed.

38
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,470
Let's look at the mid lane.

39
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,270
The mid-laner has picked Susabi.

40
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,400
Susabi is a roaming-type assassin shikigami.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,789
Although

42
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,310
his early game laning ability isn't particularly strong,

43
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,430
he has control, mobility, and damage.

44
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,470
Picking such a shikigami means that,

45
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,550
if you can't target and suppress him in the early game,

46
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,510
once he starts farming in the late game,

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,829
he's going to be really difficult to deal with.

48
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,430
To be honest,

49
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,100
Teammates.

50
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,510
To be frank,

51
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,790
the enemy jungler is my ex-boyfriend,

52
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,840
the kind that didn't end things on good terms.

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,970
I guess he'll be coming to gank me soon.

54
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,790
Hey, K,

55
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,680
if you really don't come and help me this game,

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,760
I'll die right in front of you.

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,750
Like, actually die.

58
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,070
I'm the jungler.

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,160
I'll come when the time is right.

60
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,020
Sis,

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,870
your esports post on The Legend of the White Snake

62
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,329
is so creative, I just can't get enough of it!

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,079
What's so funny?

64
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,329
If people don't offend me, I won't offend them.

65
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,390
But if they do offend me...

66
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,600
You're Xu Xian.

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,590
Heal the wounded and rescue the dying.

68
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,050
Let him heal himself, look how pitiful he is!

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,760
Pang, let's go for a fight.

70
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,420
Go up and take some damage to bait the enemy.

71
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,130
Okay.

72
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,900
Go, go, go!

73
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,710
Pang's Kuro

74
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,070
took two enemy skills and is down to half health.

75
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,560
Protect him, protect him! Can we protect him?

76
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,710
Pang counters with a Soul Bind,

77
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,690
slowing down Butterfly.

78
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,880
Chessman steps forward with a combo,

79
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,510
taking down Butterfly.

80
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,430
Beautiful!

81
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,630
Hold them down for me, I'll deal the damage.

82
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,580
They're here. I'm holding them down.

83
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,650
Pang locked down Wang again,

84
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,520
Chessman dealt the damage,

85
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,680
securing a double kill.

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,750
Wow, in this play, Chessman

87
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,590
left the opponents with no chance to fight back.

88
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,010
Long live our Captain.

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,690
Tong Yao.

90
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,280
Too bad the first blood wasn't your ex.

91
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,750
Alright, mid laner Smiling's farming is pretty good too

92
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,610
but Floret seems a bit impatient.

93
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,590
This round of trading damage wasn't worth it at all.

94
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,550
God Yang is in the mid lane now.

95
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,150
Will he go for the gank or not?

96
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,160
Okay, God Yang is going in!

97
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,710
K!

98
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,330
I'm here.

99
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,560
God Yang, what's wrong with you?

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,700
Smiling is playing well.

101
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,430
We need to change our strategy.

102
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,170
Let's change our strategy.

103
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,430
Okay.

104
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,520
Is Jian Yang heading to camp the top lane?

105
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,170
Sure enough,

106
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,120
Cat has been taken down by God Yang.

107
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,240
Now, as we can see,

108
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,520
that mistake just now

109
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,670
might lead to a fight over the Octopus.

110
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,800
Team ZGDX

111
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,909
should probably give up on Octopus.

112
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,600
We can see God Yang's farming is pretty solid.

113
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,980
After abandoning the mid and bottom lanes,

114
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,090
he ganked the top lane twice and secured kills both times,

115
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,150
so his farm is really good.

116
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,340
However, the real problem

117
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,950
lies in the mid and bottom lanes.

118
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,659
Chessman has already

119
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,790
completely suppressed Butterfly.

120
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,720
Is bottom lane ready?

121
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,440
I'm coming, I'm coming.

122
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
Let's fight.

123
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,210
Go.

124
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,280
-Smiling has gone to the bottom lane.
-They've started the fight in the bottom lane.

125
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,570
Smiling launched her ultimate from the bush.

126
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,600
Chessman's ultimate dealt massive damage.

127
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,040
Give me a kill.

128
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,880
I came all the way to bottom lane

129
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,040
and you stole my kill.

130
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,770
I'm never teaming up with you again.

131
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,930
Keep complaining. Be careful not to poop your pants.

132
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,470
Can't you just forget about that?

133
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,230
I can't.

134
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,660
Don't remind me then.

135
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,570
Smiling contributed a lot in that last fight.

136
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,170
She caught them off guard.

137
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,220
In the end, CK's bot lane was completely crushed.

138
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,620
They won! They won!

139
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,080
Look, my daughter won!

140
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,210
Alright, alright.

141
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,140
What do you mean "they won"?

142
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,440
If they've won, why are they still playing?

143
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,310
She just got a kill for Chessman,

144
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,950
that's all.

145
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,190
Don't get too excited.

146
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,520
That's not easy either.

147
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,360
You two are really comfortable at the front and the back, huh?

148
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,320
Do you know that

149
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,510
there's also a top lane in this game?

150
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,520
Our opponent is Luck.

151
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
He got a buff right at the start,

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,680
and I'm getting totally crushed over here.

153
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
How am I supposed to play like this?

154
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,550
K, when we're at the training base,

155
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,180
you're glued to me.

156
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,470
But in actual matches, you don't even come to help.

157
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,140
You're such a jerk.

158
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,750
We're not conjoined twins.

159
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,280
Fine, whatever.

160
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,760
I'll go top next wave.

161
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Alright, I'm coming now.

162
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,159
Let's go.

163
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,600
K, you and Cat

164
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,840
push the top lane's first tower.

165
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,480
Okay.

166
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,720
At this moment, Luck doesn't have her ultimate skill available

167
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
and is still fragile.

168
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,920
Team ZGDX timed this perfectly.

169
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,960
But Floret and God Yang have also come to support the top lane.

170
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,680
Both teams' mid, top, and jungle

171
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,420
have engaged in a small skirmish in the top lane.

172
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,510
Cat initiated the fight with his second skill, controlling Luck.

173
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,490
Smiling followed with her combo and ultimate skill.

174
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,690
Luck has been killed.

175
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,360
Let's do Orochi.

176
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,130
Roger that.

177
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,890
Coming.

178
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,400
K, save your suppression.

179
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,130
Pang, hold onto your ultimate.

180
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,830
Why does it feel like Chessman

181
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,289
is leading the team at such a fast pace today?

182
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,539
It's so fast,

183
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,130
I could barely keep up just now.

184
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,030
We've got this.

185
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,020
Come on, keep going.

186
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,360
Group up in the mid lane, push to the high ground.

187
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,520
Alright, understood.

188
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,320
Let's push mid lane in one go.

189
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,290
Go, go, go! Charge!

190
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
ZGDX is already advancing mid lane.

191
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,120
Are they about to finish in one wave?

192
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,110
ZGDX has already pushed onto high ground.

193
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,270
They've reached the high ground.

194
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,920
Come on.

195
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,160
Come on.

196
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,370
Target the base!

197
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,900
It's destroyed!

198
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,740
- That was so fast!
- Beautiful.

199
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,880
They slayed it!

200
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,110
The match is over.

201
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,230
Congratulations to ZGDX

202
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,250
for securing the first victory of the opening match!

203
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,520
Chessman was outstanding.

204
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,920
Smiling played this round

205
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,960
exceptionally well too.

206
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,400
Indeed.

207
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,460
As expected from the No. 1 Tamamonomae player in China.

208
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,590
It's okay.

209
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,090
Let's do better next game.

210
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,040
Smiling!

211
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,880
Smiling!

212
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,160
Jian Yang died miserably this round.

213
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,640
God Yang, what's wrong with you?

214
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,970
You were completely off your game in that last match.

215
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,030
You were either a step too slow

216
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,720
or completely missed your teammates' signals.

217
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,760
You were feeding kills to the enemy like they were free.

218
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,360
You didn't follow

219
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,760
the strategy we set before the match at all.

220
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,260
I'm sorry, Coach.

221
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,850
I don't want your apology.

222
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,710
What I want is for you to

223
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,110
pull yourself together for the next match.

224
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,720
In the last match,

225
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,610
ZGDX used a fast-paced strategy.

226
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,430
I observed that in the last match,

227
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,120
Chessman wasn't in great form either.

228
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,240
So in the next match,

229
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,900
let's drag it to the late game.

230
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,780
Okay?

231
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,390
Understood.

232
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,860
Floret.

233
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,800
God Yang.

234
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,100
How does it feel to get crushed by your old rival and ex-girlfriend teaming up?

235
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,390
Like watching your own cabbage being rooted up by a pig, right?

236
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,570
It must be heartbreaking.

237
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,210
No,

238
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,750
it's like a heart attack.

239
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,440
I've seen this before.

240
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,270
It's over.

241
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,200
Have you go on Weibo?

242
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,540
Esports Farm says

243
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,080
ZGDX now has two

244
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,380
unstoppable mad dogs.

245
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,160
Really?

246
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,560
I never go on Weibo.

247
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,440
This is too funny.

248
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,840
Smiling.

249
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,940
Why are you putting on makeup if you're not checking Weibo?

250
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,840
Everyone's watching the game,

251
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,920
no one's looking at you.

252
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
As a mad dog in the spotlight,

253
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,080
I need to look beautiful.

254
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,960
Sis,

255
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,650
your idol baggage is even heavier than Cheng's now.

256
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,850
I think

257
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,500
you've been influenced by K.

258
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,160
Talk about mad dogs all you want,

259
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,240
but don't bring me into this.

260
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,810
What's wrong with mentioning you?

261
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,810
Lame.

262
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,350
Cheng, you have a fever?

263
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,140
Let's finish this quickly.

264
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,670
Really?

265
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,160
Cheng has a fever,

266
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,180
and Tong Yao wants to take a dump.

267
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,330
What are we going to do in the next match?

268
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,810
Why do I feel like Chessman's gameplay

269
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,330
is off this round?

270
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,640
Yes, indeed. It's not as good as the last round.

271
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,950
He's been suppressed by Butterfly since the early game.

272
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,280
Focus on the bottom lane.

273
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,800
Alright.

274
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,920
Chessman doesn't seem to be in the zone.

275
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,780
Cheng, fall back. I'll cover you.

276
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,190
Come to the bottom lane.

277
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,120
Coming, coming.

278
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,880
God Yang's Yuki Doji has caught up

279
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,280
and taken Chessman down.

280
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,520
Pang's Ichimokuren barely escaped with low health using blink.

281
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,330
CK's bottom lane and jungle coordination was quite impressive for this round.

282
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,860
Good job.

283
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,170
Well done. Nice.

284
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,010
Captain, are you okay?

285
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,020
I'm fine.

286
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,640
Pang, go support other lanes.

287
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,730
I'll farm in the bottom lane.

288
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,560
Okay, be careful.

289
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,600
Come over, let's engage Orochi.

290
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,890
-Okay.
-Coming.

291
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,980
Do you think Team CK is going for Orochi now?

292
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,040
Isn't it risky for them to engage now?

293
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
It should be fine.

294
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,760
Look, Chessman has just respawned

295
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,520
and CK's bottom lane minion wave is very strong.

296
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,290
They're going for Orochi.

297
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,960
Don't go in alone. Wait for us.

298
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,760
If CK tries to initiate a team fight,

299
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,600
it'll be five versus four. Based on the data,

300
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,990
Team ZGDX is taking a risky gamble.

301
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,810
Where is Smiling going?

302
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,550
Does she want to fight alone against five others?

303
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,540
She's going in!

304
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,160
Smiling has already charged in.

305
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
Watch out for incoming enemies.

306
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,320
On the side, on the side!

307
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,640
Be careful, watch out for Butterfly.

308
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,360
Smiling predicts Butterfly's movement

309
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,200
and activates her ultimate.

310
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,880
Butterfly is hit and falls.

311
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,160
Cat, hurry up and come over.

312
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,070
We can take over this Orochi.

313
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,160
Alright, I'm on my way now.

314
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,670
I'm here.

315
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm on my way too.

316
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,840
-I'm here.
-Hold guard.

317
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,160
Cat uses his ultimate and charges into the Orochi pit,

318
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,480
stunning God Yang with his third skill.

319
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,080
Smiling's first skill takes out Floret,

320
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,750
completing a double kill!

321
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,470
Keep fighting, keep fighting.

322
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,140
Don't run.

323
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,710
Wang activates his ultimate.

324
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,480
Jian Yang and Luck dash towards Smiling.

325
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,960
Smiling uses blink to dodge a skill

326
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,400
but she's hit by Luck.

327
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,510
At the crucial moment, Pang rushes out.

328
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,440
Smiling is safe now.

329
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,300
Luck is slowed down. Triple kill!

330
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,000
What are they doing?

331
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,240
Luck is slowed down. Triple kill!

332
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,200
Fall back!

333
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,360
Sis is just too amazing.

334
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,130
Oh my god.

335
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,280
Let's go back and take Orochi.

336
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,000
Alright, let's go.

337
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,510
CK's members are dying one after another.

338
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,680
This was a 0-for-3 trade.

339
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,390
Team ZGDX played beautifully.

340
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,560
Yes, especially Smiling.

341
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,400
She's really fierce.

342
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,440
She jumped into the fight without hesitation

343
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,190
and her ultimate predictions were spot on.

344
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,040
-One wave.
-No wonder she's the No. 1 Tamamonomae player in China.

345
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,030
We can push the tower directly now.

346
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,550
Okay, I'm coming.

347
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,080
Cheng, can I go bait them?

348
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Pang, is your ultimate ready?

349
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Five seconds.

350
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,440
Alright, I'll go bait them.

351
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
Three, two, one.

352
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,930
Go!

353
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,580
Spread out, spread out!

354
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,250
Don't rush, don't rush.

355
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,080
It looks like Team ZGDX wants to end this in one wave.

356
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
I'll fall back a bit first.

357
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,200
You guys go and hold the front line.

358
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,670
Don't rush, don't rush.

359
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,730
I'll tank the damage, you guys focus on dealing damage.

360
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,400
Two seconds, two seconds.

361
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,060
We're waiting for you.

362
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,160
Defend the tower, defend the tower!

363
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,640
The tower is important.

364
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,860
-Go, K keep up!
-Go!

365
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,790
-Go down.
-Protect ADC.

366
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,000
Double kill! Smiling has scored another double kill.

367
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,060
Go for it, go for it!

368
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,580
Don't spread out too much.

369
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,600
Stay close.

370
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,680
Retreat to the fountain.

371
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,830
But K is hot on their heels.

372
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,040
Smiling activates her ultimate.

373
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,440
Triple kill!

374
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,640
Nice! Hit the tower, hit the tower!

375
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Take down their high ground.

376
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,570
Group up, group up! Push together!

377
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,720
Congratulations to Team ZGDX on their victory.

378
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,430
Yes!

379
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,040
The underdog turned things around in a big way today!

380
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,720
Yes!

381
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,070
-Yes.
-Smiling was so fierce.

382
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,040
Even with Chessman not in peak condition,

383
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,920
Team ZGDX

384
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,800
still demonstrated their incredible fighting power.

385
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
As expected, Tamamonomae lives up to her reputation.

386
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,640
This wave was really amazing.

387
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,360
It was truly spectacular.

388
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,120
Awesome!

389
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,520
Now that's what I call winning!

390
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,920
Our daughter won, Hubby!

391
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,980
My daughter is amazing!

392
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
Of course she is!

393
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,210
Well, she is my daughter after all.

394
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,890
You're not against it anymore?

395
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,560
Alright, alright.

396
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,680
Just eat your food.

397
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,520
Smiling!

398
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,960
That was fantastic!

399
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,760
Tong Yao.

400
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,160
K,

401
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,460
I'm sorry.

402
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,230
I was too nervous today.

403
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,380
I just wanted to say

404
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,210
you played well.

405
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,170
Thank you.

406
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,250
Let's go.

407
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,660
Congratulations.

408
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,420
Congratulations.

409
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,780
Congratulations.

410
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,010
Let go.

411
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,650
You've gotten stronger.

412
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,260
Yes,

413
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,920
so we'll be shaking hands often from now on,

414
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,069
until you retire.

415
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,040
Let go.

416
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:25,980
That's rude.

417
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,920
See you at the next match.

418
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,200
Come on!

419
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,970
Smiling! Smiling!

420
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,330
Let's welcome Chessman and Smiling

421
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,000
to our interview area.

422
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Welcome, Tong Yao. Welcome, Cheng.

423
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,540
Today,

424
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,910
you both consecutively earned

425
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,440
the MVP title for two games.

426
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,890
I'd like to ask Tong Yao,

427
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,640
I heard that today,

428
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,360
before the match, you were so nervous that

429
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,040
you started quoting last season's catchphrases.

430
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,940
Is that true?

431
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,090
I...

432
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,330
It's like a country kid's first time in the big city.

433
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,850
Being nervous is normal.

434
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,080
Then, I'd like to ask Cheng,

435
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,150
was today's quick victory

436
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,810
a way to settle the score from the Spring Finals?

437
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,770
Not at all.

438
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,260
It was just a normal match.

439
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,720
Then, Cheng,

440
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,760
could you please evaluate the new mid laner Smiling's

441
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
performance in today's opening match?

442
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,600
She earned MVP in the second game today.

443
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,880
Did she meet your expectations?

444
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,680
She was okay.

445
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,790
Alright, thank you both for the interview.

446
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,010
Thank you, Cheng. Thank you, Tong Yao.

447
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,810
Thank you.

448
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,560
Thank you to all the reporters for being here today.

449
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,770
This concludes today's MVP interview.

450
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,760
In that last team fight, four of them were top lane.

451
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,820
I went straight in.

452
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,160
You're finally here.

453
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,440
We've been waiting for you.

454
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,320
You're so childish.

455
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,040
Exactly.

456
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,100
-You wouldn't have won without me.
-Where is Cheng?

457
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,560
Cheng caught a cold and went back first.

458
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,280
Hurry up and get ready.

459
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,680
Don't be late for the carnival event later.

460
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,670
No fun.

461
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,250
What's wrong?

462
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,920
Rui, about that event tonight,

463
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,430
can I skip it too?

464
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,810
What's wrong with you now?

465
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,960
Are you planning to join Cheng in being out of commission?

466
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,080
I...

467
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,510
I.

468
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,270
My pants are dirty.

469
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,170
Did you soil yourself?

470
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,080
No.

471
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,880
My period started.

472
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,000
I just used DiDi

473
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,870
to get a car to take Cheng home.

474
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,770
It probably hasn't gone far.

475
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,030
I'll call him back now.

476
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,700
Driver, yes, it's me.

477
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,610
Sorry to trouble you, but I need you to come back.

478
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,960
We have another fallen soldier here.

479
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,350
Yes, yes, I'm sorry.

480
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,370
He'll be here soon. Just wait a moment.

481
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,330
Thank you, Rui.

482
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,140
What's wrong?

483
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,330
Your manager said to come back and pick someone up.

484
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,870
What's the matter?

485
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,880
Since you're not feeling well, I specially requested to come and take care of you.

486
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,030
I do have a fever,

487
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,550
but I haven't lost my mind.

488
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,510
What's going on?

489
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,350
My pants got dirty.

490
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,770
You pooped your pants?

491
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,180
Then stay away from me.

492
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,340
Your nose is stuffed, you can't smell anything anyway.

493
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,140
It's still an eyesore, alright?

494
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,140
Young lady,

495
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,990
don't forget to fasten your seatbelt.

496
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,720
Okay.

497
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,850
Mr. Li, it's you?

498
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
What a coincidence.

499
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,670
You know, with your DiDi Premier,

500
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,480
have you considered becoming my private car service?

501
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,030
Actually,

502
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,080
owning a car doesn't matter these days.

503
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,330
With DiDi Premier,

504
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,620
it's like having your own private car.

505
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,420
It's not only environmentally friendly and green,

506
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,530
but also saves you parking fees, right?

507
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,440
Yes, yes.

508
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,160
Hey, Jinyang.

509
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,080
Yao, let me tell you,

510
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,870
you were so cool today.

511
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,560
Where are you?

512
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,110
How did you disappear so quickly?

513
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,310
My period came,

514
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,750
I'm in a hurry to get home.

515
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,280
I've got to go now.

516
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,740
Both of you, please sit tight.

517
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,620
We're about to start driving.

518
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,300
Alright.

519
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,070
I went to the live opening match of the National League today.

520
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,120
After the game, during the handshake,

521
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,840
God Yang wouldn't

522
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,880
let go of Smiling's hand.

523
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,890
I saw it clearly from the front row.

524
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,070
God Yang, Smiling,

525
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,730
let me up there, quick, quick!

526
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,620
Make sure Cheng takes his medicine.

527
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,580
How old is he?

528
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,160
Can't he take it himself?

529
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,050
If you leave him to take it himself, he definitely won't.

530
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,840
There's no choice, we have to help him out.

531
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,920
If he dies from illness, we'll have no captain.

532
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
I support Pang to take over.

533
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,030
Then when you argue with Lu Yue,

534
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,160
no one will help you.

535
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,010
Pang can't handle Lu Yue.

536
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,510
Recently, due to some mysterious guilt,

537
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,930
he's been catering to Lu Yue's every whim.

538
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,720
He even serves him during meals.

539
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,180
Where's the first aid kit?

540
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,270
[On top of the fridge]

541
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,900
Captain, it's time for your medicine.

542
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,770
Why are you sneaking into my room?

543
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,050
Rui asked me to make sure you take your medicine.

544
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,010
Just leave it there. I'll take it myself later.

545
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,610
Take your medicine before you go back to sleep.

546
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,170
Here.

547
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
The water's too hot. Get me a new cup.

548
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,260
Do you know?

549
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,400
The pain women experience during those few days each month,

550
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,260
multiplied by three, is about equal to labor pains.

551
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,540
You know how painful it is for women to give birth, right?

552
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,240
it's like pulling your lower lip

553
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,510
and stretching it over your entire head.

554
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,580
That's about how painful it is.

555
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,260
So whenever this time comes,

556
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,430
even if Godzilla were to invade Earth,

557
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,480
I could kick it back into the sea with one foot.

558
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,070
All because

559
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,970
it dared to disturb me from being a peaceful, beautiful girl.

560
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,610
So, drink water and take your medicine.

561
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,740
Don't be difficult.

562
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Take another sip.

563
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,470
When you're sick, you need to drink plenty of hot water.

564
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,260
Oh, right.

565
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,360
You shouldn't take medicine on an empty stomach.

566
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,890
I'm ordering takeout. What do you want to eat?

567
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,180
I want to die.

568
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,180
If you want to die, that's not impossible,

569
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,740
but now is not the time.

570
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,150
Your Majesty, if you must die, it should be after

571
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,280
dealing with that treacherous Lu Yue.

572
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,480
What do you want to eat?

573
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,410
Braised chicken with rice? Spicy hot pot?

574
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,880
Japanese or Korean food?

575
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,090
"Nothing" isn't an option.

576
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,360
How can you have such a good appetite when your stomach hurts?

577
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,070
And who eats Japanese food when they have stomach pain?

578
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,470
I'm ordering for you.

579
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,920
I want to have porridge.

580
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,750
I want porridge too.

581
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,040
I want white porridge

582
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,370
with brown sugar added.

583
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,600
Order takeout then.

584
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
There's brown sugar in the kitchen.

585
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Drink the porridge when it arrives.

586
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,110
What's wrong?

587
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,910
None of these porridge shops have white porridge.

588
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,510
The few that do have it don't have good reviews.

589
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,590
Forget it, I'll cook it myself.

590
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,300
I'm not used to store-bought porridge anyway.

591
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,050
You should get some sleep first.

592
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,450
I'll wake you up when the porridge is ready.

593
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,740
Can the weak and sick at the training base get any better?

594
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,520
What are you doing?

595
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,840
Why did you come down?

596
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,760
If you want water, just send me a message.

597
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,020
I'll bring it up to you.

598
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,450
Move aside.

599
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,550
What's going on?

600
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,890
When Godzilla invades Earth,

601
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,290
women can't touch water.

602
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,080
Let me know when it's ready.

603
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,010
I'll go up first.

604
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,750
Why did you suddenly turn back?

605
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,920
Why are you following me?

606
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,560
Cheng, do you have a girlfriend?

607
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,720
No,

608
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,670
I'm not that curious either.

609
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,460
I was just asking casually.

610
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,360
If you don't want to tell me...

611
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,070
I don't.

612
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,860
When I was in school, I lived at home.

613
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,600
My mom had certain days every month

614
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,920
when she would boss me around.

615
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,730
So I grew up with the belief

616
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,040
that women have certain days each month

617
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,440
when they can act however they want.

618
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,480
I see.

619
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,420
That must have been tough for you.

620
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,600
That's why I moved to the dorms later on.

621
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,130
Even in the scorching summer, I wouldn't go home.

622
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,990
That's really impressive of you.

623
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,450
I won't easily get into a relationship with someone.

624
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,450
Is that so?

625
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,440
You look like

626
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,310
someone who doesn't even like humans.

627
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,240
What did you say?

628
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,530
It's not that I don't like humans.

629
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,530
I like games.

630
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,780
If I were to date someone,

631
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,820
I'd want someone who's better at games than I am.

632
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,080
A human who's better at games than Chessman...

633
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,570
A woman?

634
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,430
Are you kidding me?

635
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,570
It's over.

636
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,050
Cheng either doesn't like women

637
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,970
or he doesn't like humans at all.

638
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,210
What makes you say that?

639
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,600
He said he wants to find someone

640
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,930
who's better at gaming than him to date.

641
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,860
Does that include Tetris, Onmyoji,

642
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,390
or The Untamed mobile game?

643
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,650
He didn't specify which game they need to be good at.

644
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,140
If your stomach hurts,

645
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,140
go lie down and have some warm water.

646
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,700
Why are you here?

647
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,270
Don't you want to sleep a bit more?

648
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,270
The porridge isn't ready yet.

649
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,330
What are you doing?

650
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,060
I'm watching a livestream.

651
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,800
Is the sound too loud?

652
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,760
Did I disturb you?

653
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm sorry.

654
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,450
I'll turn down the volume a bit.

655
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,260
Why don't you go back to sleep for a while?

656
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,940
No need.

657
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,220
I thought you might have burned yourself with the porridge.

658
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,260
How is that possible?

659
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,320
I'm not that...

660
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,040
Can't you get a hot water bottle for yourself?

661
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,800
I...

662
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,830
How would I know if the training base has hot water bottles?

663
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,200
How would you know if you don't ask?

664
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,000
Wait here.

665
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,220
As an esports star,

666
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,200
Cheng doesn't talk much during matches.

667
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,640
Other than necessary commands,

668
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,010
he's mostly quiet

669
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,290
and focused on doing his own thing.

670
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,690
Listening to his teammates joking around like they're performing a comedy skit

671
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,360
might also have activated some sort of mental mute function,

672
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,090
so he isn't even listening to their nonsense.

673
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,020
Who knows?

674
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,200
This is...

675
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,190
It's from fans.

676
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,920
How could you just do that?

677
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,510
Suddenly touching a young girl's belly.

678
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,170
I can't touch a tiger's belly.

679
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,380
In ancient times, doing this would mean you have to marry me.

680
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,790
I thought I was doing a good deed.

681
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,450
Why am I being punished for it?

682
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,160
In ancient times, I would have married you 800 times

683
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,960
and then divorced you 800 times.

684
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,760
Marry and divorce,

685
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,100
and then repeat it 800 times.

686
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,140
Isn't that just being a jerk?

687
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,790
I don't know.

688
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,320
Maybe I suffer from intermittent blindness.

689
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,780
Cheng,

690
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,250
I'm sorry.

691
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,420
I was supposed to take care of you,

692
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,050
but it ended up being the other way around.

693
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,130
When

694
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,989
and with who did you agree to take care of me?

695
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,670
It's clearly because your own stomach hurt,

696
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,730
so you shamelessly followed me back.

697
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,429
Why hasn't your fever gone down yet?

698
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,360
Do you think the stuff you gave me

699
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,020
was some kind of miracle cure?

700
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,420
Come on, let me take care of you now.

701
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:32,860
This time...

702
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,840
Your stomach doesn't hurt anymore?

703
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,480
It does.

704
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,360
If it hurts, forget it.

705
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,760
I don't want someone with a pale face

706
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,460
rolling around on the carpet in my room.

707
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,440
But you need to be taken care of.

708
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,239
I don't need it.

709
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:40,909
You do.

710
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,600
I don't.

711
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,510
You do.

712
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,600
Let's go.

713
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,020
-You do.
-I don't.

714
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,000
You do.

715
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,120
I really don't.

716
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,030
No objections.

717
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,110
Let's go, let's go.

718
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,150
I don't need it.

719
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,040
You do.

720
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,760
I don't.

721
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,760
You do.

722
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,630
I don't.

723
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,520
I said you need it.

724
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,050
Hurry up.

725
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,880
We're back.

726
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,680
Quick.

727
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,440
We're here, we're back!

728
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,830
We brought you some delicious food.

729
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,180
Where are they?

730
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,010
Did they take their medicine and fall asleep?

731
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,580
I should go check on Cheng and the others.

732
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,310
God Ming.

733
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,470
What are you doing?

734
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,390
What the hell!

735
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,840
I...

736
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,890
Go, go up.

737
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,520
My brother didn't die from illness, did he?

738
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,220
-Really?
-Let's go have a look.

739
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,760
What are you doing?

740
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,920
What's wrong?

741
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,990
Did you see a ghost?

742
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,330
It's even more terrifying than that.

743
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,430
What is it?
