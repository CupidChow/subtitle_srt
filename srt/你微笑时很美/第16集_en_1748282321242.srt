1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, Miss.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Can you say hello to my fans?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. I'm ZZDF The Smiling.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're the two of us.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Cheng Ge is usually not that fierce.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Eat more. Don't be nervous.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I want to eat my own food.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Shit!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Shit!

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You were so cute when you were playing the game.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll throw it away if you dare to show up again.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Please ask Zhang Yinghe.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll ask him.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You said you're my girl.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're a huge peach blossom.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And you want to take the peach blossom from others.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Is that your boyfriend?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm a little nervous.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not nervous.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not nervous.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not nervous.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not nervous.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not nervous.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not nervous.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not nervous.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not nervous.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not nervous.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not nervous.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not nervous.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not nervous.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not nervous.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not nervous.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not nervous.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not nervous.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm not nervous.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not nervous.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not nervous.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hello, audience.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Welcome to the live broadcast of 2020 OPL

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
The World's Quietest.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm the best reporter, Hong Heng.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,360
So the team that participated in the final is

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,960
the LGD X and the Blue Team.

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
I believe that you have been looking forward to this match for a long time.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,840
What are you laughing at?

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,880
Is today's match interesting?

47
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,680
Explain it.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,480
Sima is in the private room.

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,320
Her passionate and friendly match is like Su Ruo.

50
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
Okay?

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
She is like a normal Su Ruo.

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
And Xiao Ai is smelling.

53
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,280
She is also in the private room.

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,040
She is a good person.

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,800
What is this?

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
A big

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,720
Okay, Old K跟上.

58
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,520
Here it comes.

59
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,600
Big, big.

60
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,440
Okay, okay.

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Little Fatty, bring these six friends.

62
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,720
What's going on?

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,120
There is a situation.

64
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
Yes.

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,080
The final match was really a three-point win.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,320
It was really a great win.

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,080
That's right.

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,920
I still have a little bit of a heart attack.

69
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,400
It's really the LGD X.

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,800
That's right.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,480
They just showed their super-strong ability.

72
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,400
It's really the first team to be in the team.

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,080
That's right.

74
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,040
But I think it's a pity that

75
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,600
I didn't get the money to go to the gym.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,640
It's a big match.

77
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,000
As a new champion,

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
I can't believe that

79
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,440
there is no such thing as a one-point win.

80
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,000
We can't be in a good condition.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
It's over.

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,960
Let's go, Old K.

83
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,760
Let's go.

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
What's wrong?

85
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,920
There is a woman like this in the Han drama.

86
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
How did the female lead handle it?

87
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,600
There are no sleeping plugins around.

88
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,100
There is a

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,440
negative negative negative negative negative negative negative positive negative negative negative negative

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,720
negative negative negative negative genuinely positive positive negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative positive negative negativekward negative negative positive negative.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,880
Yuzi.

92
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,800
If you fall in trouble because of someone,

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,660
Although we saw each other,

94
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,260
our lives became different every day.

95
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,660
Even when we are barely made in the world,

96
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,800
what's the difference?

97
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,400
What's the difference?

98
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,380
Nothing, nothing.

99
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,700
This isホ GREED,

100
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,080
It's a miracle.

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,500
She's really Eight Storey Badger.

102
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,400
At 18.

103
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,200
This is my bag and that's mine.

104
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,060
Thank you.

105
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,740
Here you are.

106
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,920
And this questo for him.

107
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,860
So that your breasts can cover up your scars less.

108
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,400
So five times a day we aren't that separated.

109
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,560
Congratulations on your victory.

110
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,760
Thank you.

111
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,760
Help! Help! Help!

112
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,320
I suddenly felt strange

113
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
and had a bad and vicious idea

114
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,200
about a person I knew.

115
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,160
Welcome to the world of adults.

116
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,880
It's a very strange situation.

117
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,240
It's like a dog

118
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,640
is secretly walking on the wire

119
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,840
of his floor.

120
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,840
Silly boy,

121
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,640
you're so hard-working.

122
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
Tell me.

123
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,760
Which wire are you

124
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,840
secretly walking on?

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,080
The one in the village.

126
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,120
Oh.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,680
Brother Cheng,

128
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,240
you finally admit me.

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880
You're so good-looking

130
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,080
and so good-looking.

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,040
You're very sincere

132
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
to the person who gave flowers to the captain.

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
It's not cheap

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
to be this big.

135
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,440
Brother Cheng,

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,240
that fan

137
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
gave it to you

138
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,760
as a wedding gift.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,280
What about Tong Yao?

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,800
That's all

141
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
for the fairy tale.

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
What?

143
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,360
I heard a drop

144
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,120
falling on the grass.

145
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,120
I heard the sound of the faraway

146
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,760
coming out of the cabinet.

147
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,160
I still didn't hear

148
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,240
your voice.

149
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,920
I said I'm sorry.

150
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,800
Maybe I was

151
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,360
busy with smile and crying.

152
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
I was busy with the drama.

153
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,720
Hey,

154
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,800
you're here.

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,520
Interesting?

156
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,040
I was talking as I have

157
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,120
a single wash longer on the first floor.

158
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,680
It turned out

159
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
we'd be on a"...

160
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,360
second floor now!

161
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,200
Geez!

162
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
You want a big laugh.

163
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,200
Here, you've got some more.

164
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,600
The ego

165
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,520
is all dependent on the drama.

166
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,400
Please keep that word.

167
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,480
What necessary was this?

168
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,440
I can still recognize it from your face.

169
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,640
You have a girlfriend,

170
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
but you don't tell us.

171
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,040
Are you a teammate?

172
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,080
You are in the competition,

173
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,640
how can we

174
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,120
give you the back of Anxin?

175
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,640
Right?

176
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Yes.

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,160
I thought Brother Cheng

178
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
wouldn't fall in love with humans.

179
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
How could you be with

180
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,520
people like you

181
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
every day?

182
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
Hello.

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Excuse me.

184
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,320
Why is he here again?

185
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,840
Where should I eat?

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,520
Miss.

187
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,440
Eat.

188
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,760
It's delicious.

189
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
I prepared these for you.

190
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,200
They are very powerful.

191
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,000
They are good for your health.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,720
Yes.

193
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,840
Yes.

194
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,520
Eat.

195
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
It's delicious.

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,320
You eat a bag every day

197
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,640
and you will think of me every day.

198
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,320
Yes.

199
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,160
What are you doing

200
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
in our bathroom?

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
You are making me feel uncomfortable.

202
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Right?

203
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm just giving you a snack.

204
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
I'm feeling good.

205
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,480
I haven't seen

206
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,240
a morning in Korea, right?

207
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,920
I can hear

208
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,800
his voice.

209
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,040
Miss.

210
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,560
You are so cute.

211
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,320
Bye.

212
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520
What's going on?

213
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,960
You didn't ask us

214
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,240
if we want WeChat.

215
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
Why are you the only one

216
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,960
who has a comprehensive Chinese character?

217
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
We don't have one.

218
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,600
I don't need to think

219
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,480
about it.

220
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,920
It's time.

221
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,720
You are almost...

222
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,160
What's going on?

223
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,640
We will have two shops later.

224
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,040
You have ten minutes to rest.

225
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,680
You are going to have a party?

226
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,080
It's so luxurious.

227
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,880
We are so beautiful and beautiful

228
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
for the second floor of the Chinese suburb.

229
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,880
Yes.

230
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,040
You?

231
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,280
You are so rude.

232
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,840
What's going on?

233
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,240
The enemy of the Fanatic team

234
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,280
wants to be the top girl.

235
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,200
He is the top girl

236
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
of the Chinese suburb.

237
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,600
Kun?

238
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,480
You are the same?

239
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,760
Last time, you were so crazy.

240
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,200
You are the only one

241
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,040
who can marry my daughter.

242
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,920
Dog?

243
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,800
You are so romantic.

244
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,600
You are so mean.

245
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,880
As the captain,

246
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,720
I want to tell you something.

247
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,920
What?

248
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,320
Stay away from that girl.

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,120
But the Chinese suburb

250
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,920
is so delicious.

251
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,520
Who took the vegetarian meal?

252
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,840
How did I smell the sourness of Yisi?

253
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I'm sour.

254
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,440
Sour.

255
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,000
Sour.

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,320
You are all

257
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,800
so naughty.

258
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,240
Let's go.

259
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
It's time to go to bed.

260
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,240
Let's go.

261
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,440
Let's go.

262
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,000
I heard the rain falling on the grassland.

263
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,160
I heard the sound of the garden.

264
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,040
Okay.

265
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,320
I still don't know

266
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,240
where you are.

267
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,360
Let's go.

268
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,880
Go.

269
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,640
That's my child.

270
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,600
Not bad.

271
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,520
Come on.

272
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,440
Come on.

273
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
processing material.

274
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,520
This place is so great.

276
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,840
Let's cook.

277
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,160
Ain't a mountain gimbal.

278
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,880
Ain't a dam Привет.

279
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,000
This field is so yahla.

280
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,560
Gosh, I can't.

281
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,360
You know what?

282
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,480
I just wanna show you how

283
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,900
I use hands to squeeze the love away.

284
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,040
This way, okay?

285
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,080
I am asking you to stop acting any more.

286
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,900
Are you stupid?

287
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,280
Everyone,

288
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,160
You can do as we told you.

289
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
L.O.Λ.E.

290
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
L.O.Λ.E.

291
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
L.O.Λ.E.

292
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Congratulations, Miss Xiao.

293
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
You won the match.

294
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Good job.

295
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
L.O.Λ.E.

296
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
L.O.Λ.E.

297
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
You can't walk, you're a coward.

298
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
It's your house's assistant who stepped on my shoes first.

299
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Why are you two doing this?

300
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Where's the princess's bag?

301
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Only the bag.

302
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
There's no princess.

303
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Will you be caught?

304
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Put me down first.

305
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Put me down.

306
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Put me down.

307
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Such a rare MVP method

308
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
is the first time I've seen it.

309
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
I feel like I'm being humiliated.

310
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
You're so funny.

311
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Congratulations, ZGTX.

312
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
The 2-0 good result

313
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
wins the blue team

314
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
and wins the match.

315
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Is there anything you want to say

316
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
about such a good result?

317
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
I'm very satisfied.

318
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Thank you for your support.

319
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I hope

320
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
we can continue

321
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
the challenge

322
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
with good condition.

323
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
You're so naive.

324
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
We all know

325
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
that Smelly is the only girl

326
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
in the OPL professional league.

327
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
If you want to know

328
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
how difficult it is

329
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
to be a girl

330
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
in your career

331
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
and how you need to face

332
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
more troubles than ordinary players.

333
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
It's okay.

334
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
I was nervous at first.

335
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
I couldn't tolerate it.

336
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
You can't tolerate it

337
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
and see the first performance.

338
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Later, I found

339
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
that everyone was very suitable.

340
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Miss,

341
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
welcome to ZGTX.

342
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Come on.

343
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
To dream and to be true.

344
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
To dream and to be true.

345
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Cheers.

346
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Cheers.

347
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Cheers.

348
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
No one seems to

349
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
give a special care

350
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
to girls.

351
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Cheers.

352
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
It's the best.

353
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
It's not a great thing

354
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
for girls to be professional

355
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
when they see it.

356
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
It's not a great thing.

357
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
They never think like that.

358
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
I know that

359
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
many people always think

360
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
girls are bad at math.

361
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Girls are not rational enough.

362
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Girls are like a killer.

363
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
In all aspects,

364
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
girls are not as good as boys.

365
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
But I want to say

366
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
these are all

367
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
the prejudices of Chiluo.

368
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Anything.

369
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
If girls want to do well,

370
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
they can do well.

371
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
They are smart.

372
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
They shouldn't

373
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
just be the boys' design.

374
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
I hope that

375
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
those who have these ideas

376
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
can change their mind.

377
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Brother Cheng,

378
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
you never

379
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
thank us openly.

380
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
You even didn't even praise us.

381
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
As a assistant,

382
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm so sad.

383
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
It's just that

384
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
you never praised us.

385
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Brother Cheng used to

386
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
praise Tong Yao openly.

387
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
But wait a minute.

388
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
We still have

389
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
a temporary family today.

390
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
It's when

391
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
the audiences just finished,

392
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
you guys

393
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
suddenly

394
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
hugged you

395
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
when you were waiting for the next time.

396
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
To be honest,

397
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I saw

398
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
such a romantic scene

399
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
on the stage.

400
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
It was a little fat

401
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
accidentally stepped on my shoes.

402
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
I moved them.

403
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Then he took me in.

404
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
But

405
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
all the gossip and drama

406
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
recently

407
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
are discussing

408
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
you and Brother Cheng.

409
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
We are still innocent.

410
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Sometimes,

411
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
he will do some dirty things

412
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
and say dirty things.

413
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Don't be taken away by him.

414
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
If our captain

415
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
decides to start liking people one day

416
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
and be with me,

417
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I will definitely

418
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
make a big surprise.

419
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Will you really tell us?

420
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
I'll hold my lips

421
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
and shout on the stage.

422
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Thank you very much

423
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
for accepting my interview.

424
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
That's all for today's interview.

425
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Thank you.

426
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Thank you.

427
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Thank you.

428
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Hello, everyone.

429
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm a reporter

430
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
from Jingquan Yang's plant.

431
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
ZGDX

432
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
has 2-0

433
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
and won the Blue Team.

434
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
But this is not the point.

435
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
There are fans and circle.

436
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
They said that

437
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
among the fans

438
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
who sit on ZGDX's seat 1,

439
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
there is a girl

440
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
who is very strange.

441
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
She is obviously not

442
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
in the radio.

443
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
When everyone

444
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
is busy

445
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
taking photos of

446
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
the famous actress

447
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
who is in the position of the host,

448
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
she is curious to know

449
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
who she is

450
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
and why she is taking photos of her.

451
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
And

452
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
when the first game started,

453
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
she was holding

454
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
a big tree of flowers next to her.

455
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
When the first game ended,

456
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
she took the flowers

457
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
and left the scene.

458
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
When the second game

459
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
started,

460
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
she came back.

461
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
The flowers were gone.

462
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Someone asked her

463
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
who she was

464
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
and she said

465
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I was a friend of Lu Si Cheng.

466
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
And

467
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
according to the staff,

468
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
they said they saw her

469
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
when she was on the stage.

470
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
There was a girl

471
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
who gave the flowers to Lu Si Cheng.

472
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
They should know each other.

473
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
They even said a few words.

474
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Later,

475
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
the girl

476
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
seemed to

477
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
leave without any joy.

478
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
There are more wonderful things.

479
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Please pay attention

480
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
to the environment.

481
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
We will meet again

482
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
at the same time tomorrow.

483
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
You are back.

484
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Wear it.

485
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Come on, change it.

486
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Where did you get it from?

487
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Brother Zheng asked you to come to the hotel next door.

488
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
He is so good.

489
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Wear it.

490
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Let's go.

491
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Don't you take the flowers away?

492
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Where did Brother Cheng go?

493
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
He took the flowers away.

494
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
It's a pity.

495
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Let's go.

496
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
What are you doing?

497
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
He wasted it.

498
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
If you throw it away,

499
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
you will be in trouble.

500
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Where are you going?

501
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Brother Cheng told us to buy shoes.

502
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Let's go.

503
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
So handsome.

504
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
I'm going to take a look.

505
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
How about this?

506
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
It looks good.

507
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
It's done.

508
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Do you want to buy shoes?

509
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Four, three, four, four, three, two, one.

510
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Three, six.

511
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
What's wrong?

512
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Only three, six.

513
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
You can drive me out.

514
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
What's so great about three, six?

515
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
What's so great about three, six?

516
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
This is the male one.

517
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
The smallest one is three, nine.

518
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
I'll go and see if there are any female ones.

519
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
What a coincidence.

520
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
This shoe you see

521
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
is a little female.

522
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Come and try it.

523
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
These shoes are really beautiful.

524
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
They are also very similar to men's shoes.

525
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
It's like a female.

526
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
This is strange.

527
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
I'll choose another one.

528
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
No.

529
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
It's dark.

530
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
There's no travel.

531
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
That's all.

532
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
This way.

533
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I remember.

534
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
They are the ones

535
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
from the ZGTX team.

536
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Yes, yes, yes.

537
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
They are so handsome.

538
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Men are really handsome.

539
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Yes.

540
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Yes, I'll show you the photo.

541
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Look, the one in the photo is him.

542
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
So handsome.

543
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Yes.

544
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
He's his girlfriend.

545
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Yes.

546
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
So beautiful.

547
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Right?

548
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
They are all long legs.

549
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
They look like dead people.

550
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
They are so perfect.

551
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
I like them so much.

552
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
I want a boyfriend like him.

553
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
He's an adult.

554
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
He's a girl.

555
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
He's a girl.

556
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
He's a man.

557
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Right now.

558
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
He's the only one who's going to the club.

559
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
He's going to the club.

560
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
He's going to the club.

561
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
He's going to the club.

562
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
He's a big boy.

563
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
He's not in the club.

564
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
He's a big boy.

565
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
You're thinking of this girl.

566
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,160
You can give her so many things.

567
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Look.

568
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
These netizens are

569
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
so good at talking.

570
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
They are really good at talking.

571
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
But is that girl really a girl?

572
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
I think so.

573
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
I'm going to be your sixth son.

574
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I'm going to be your sixth son.

575
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
He's a good boy.

576
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
I think it's on purpose.

577
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
It seems that Mei Jie has been working overtime this night.

578
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Who?

579
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
You said you have another arrangement.

580
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
You're buying shoes.

581
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Who is it?

582
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
I'm done shopping.

583
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Can you go out for dinner with me?

584
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Who?

585
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Meikong.

586
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Let's go.

587
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Love?

588
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
You brought your girlfriend to the mall

589
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
and sent flowers?

590
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
What is it?

591
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
So?

592
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Can't you love in the game

593
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
or what?

594
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
She's grown up.

595
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Can't you have your own life?

596
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
You mean it on purpose.

597
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
What's wrong with that?

598
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
All those female fans

599
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
treat themselves as nothing.

600
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
My husband is not a bad guy.

601
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
I let them die.

602
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
You want to follow the rules

603
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
of a circle?

604
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
You want to play games?

605
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Why are you playing with me?

606
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Do you know

607
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
how much trouble

608
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
our team has brought?

609
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
How much trouble my brother has brought?

610
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Tomorrow, the newspaper will be reported.

611
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I don't know how to do it.

612
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
It's a good news.

613
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
It's better to add more public opinion.

614
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Anyway, your family

615
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
can't wait for us to get married

616
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
and fall in love.

617
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
It's not that we can't fall in love.

618
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
It's that we can't fall in love with you.

619
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Please take care of my brother's safety.

620
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Don't bother him again.

621
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
None of your business.

622
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
You can try it.

623
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
You...

624
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Don't follow me.

625
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Wait for me.

626
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
I'll be back.

627
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
What's up?

628
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Jian Yang said Song Xie is not good.

629
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
He doesn't give Song Xie's people

630
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
some money to get married.

631
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Which village

632
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
do you come from?

633
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
Have you been to your family?

634
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
I don't know.

635
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Only the relatives

636
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
can say that.

637
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Give it back to me.

638
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
You thought I couldn't find it

639
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
when you threw it in?

640
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Take it easy.

641
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
You're so stupid.

642
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Brother Cheng.

643
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Who is that woman today?

644
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
That woman?

645
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Which woman?

646
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
How do you know everything?

647
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
You're a model.

648
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Who is she?

649
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
She's the one who arranged

650
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
the blind date for me.

651
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Why did you ask for blind date?

652
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
What do you mean?

653
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Why did you ask for blind date?

654
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
I'm already at the age of

655
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
the law firm.

656
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
I'm an adult now.

657
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Why can't I have blind date?

658
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
It's okay.

659
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
But I refuse.

660
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Don't fall in love now.

661
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Yes.

662
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
I don't want to think about this now.

663
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
I want to win the world champion's

664
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
trophy.

665
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
I'll give you a big lesson.

666
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
You're so stubborn.

667
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
It's not like you're a fake.

668
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
You're not.

669
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Can you hear that?

670
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
It's not that it's not good.

671
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
It's not that it's not good.

672
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
It's that

673
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
you don't want to have blind date.

674
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
You'll break up sooner

675
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
to waste your time on it.

676
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
How can you not?

677
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Honey.

678
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Okay.

679
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Tell me your story.

680
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
What?

681
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,160
I'm still young.

682
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
I don't know anything.

683
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
I bought all the clothes

684
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,760
I think you've paid the money for the youth and the girls.

685
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,360
See?

686
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,360
You want to know more about love.

687
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,320
Don't ask me.

688
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,160
Ask Jian Yang.

689
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,360
Yes, the one in the CK team.

690
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,280
And the one just now said that

691
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,440
the former Simei Lin

692
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
is now a team of Simei Lin

693
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,080
who is not bad.

694
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
She can be my match.

695
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,080
The hotel is still alive.

696
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,880
It's been a month.

697
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,360
The reason is that she is insulting me.

698
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,360
What do you like?

699
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,480
Didn't I say that before?

700
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,000
The game is better than me.

701
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,280
Did you hear that?

702
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
The captain doesn't like humans at all.

703
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,040
You can give up.

704
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,680
Come on, kid.

705
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,480
Solo.

706
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
Solo?

707
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,560
Solo?

708
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
So exciting.

709
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,520
Really.

710
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,560
It's not easy to watch the heat

711
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,520
when you're all up.

712
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,360
Tonight,

713
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,720
ZGDXGD

714
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,240
will hold a solo game

715
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,520
that will be the final prize of the night.

716
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,040
In the double-edgedy Tong Yao Lu Si Cheng.

717
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
Zhen messing around.

718
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,040
The助隊 is in the uproar.

719
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,360
Han Eh Yuan and ZGDXGD

720
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,320
are acting like k пo mindful.

721
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,840
It's not easy to think out what's wrong.

722
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,040
What's wrong?

723
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,960
How are youometwo uns societна?

724
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,640
We have a team.

725
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
This is still the bed for adults.

726
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,800
Watch yourself.

727
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,660
Tian progresses.

728
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,640
Come on!

729
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,560
You won the Dragon Xia.

730
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,240
Come on!

731
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,840
Come on!

732
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,440
Come on!

733
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,720
Even if I don't play this solo match,

734
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,240
I can still go to the front to eat.

735
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,720
You can't eat a ten-cent Dragon Xia alone.

736
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,880
What kind of Dragon Xia?

737
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,320
That's right.

738
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,200
I can't eat it.

739
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,680
I'll work hard to win.

740
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,600
Come on.

741
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,160
Come on!

742
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,640
Why are you still on the live?

743
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,360
The netizen invited me to the Dragon Xia.

744
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,960
It seems that Cheng Ge is more anxious than me.

745
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,920
His room is on the rooftop.

746
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
I want to try it too.

747
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
What if I win?

748
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:31,360
I'm looking for the

749
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,760
dragonхa dragon's

750
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,360
option,

751
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,040
the dragon has already run.

752
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,640
Let's go to the second game.

753
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,120
Let's start with the revenge

754
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,800
compared to the previous series.

755
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,120
I wear a key.

756
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,280
It's the dragon's lice in this game.

757
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,840
It's hot red.

758
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,120
It's a tenth of gender often.

759
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,200
From first-hand,

760
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,840
don't trick me at every bats.

761
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,600
Help me.

762
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,720
Uncle!

763
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,480
Between you guys

764
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:00,680
His route and vision

765
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,500
Can it be

766
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,440
Up to your master

767
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,300
I secretly support it

768
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,060
Support?

769
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,080
Dean

770
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,800
All right

771
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,220
Go solo

772
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,720
You try

773
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Blood Curve

774
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,680
You can shoot the soldiers in this field

775
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,680
Shut up

776
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,600
Your match reached level 6

777
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,720
Miss, be careful

778
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,520
Look, Miss has reached level 6.

779
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,920
But Brother Cheng didn't plan to give her a chance to fight.

780
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Fatty, you said it on purpose.

781
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,520
Is it that obvious?

782
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,920
It's okay.

783
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,320
It's so heavy.

784
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,920
My orange can hit now?

785
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,520
Let's granted. Don't worry.

786
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,120
Xiao Yi. Do your best.

787
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
It's okay. Let's not fight. Come on.

788
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
What are you doing? What's going on?

789
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
There's an opportunity.

790
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Chase after him.

791
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Xiaoluo, I hope you can do it.

792
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Let's go.

793
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Now both sides have 2-2 points.

794
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Both sides have reached the top 6.

795
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Now, the girl is the leader of the team.

796
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
And...

797
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Ren Tao,

798
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
the happy little dragon shrimp's journey

799
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
is to defeat the girl

800
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
and verify her legend of not loving people.

801
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Let's wait and see.

802
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,120
As a few thousand-pick old list,

803
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120
I want to say that the young boy of Manji

804
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
can't beat the young boy of Manji.

805
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Then who will beat him?

806
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Really?

807
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Yes.

808
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Oh, no.

809
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
I can't say it.

810
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Brother Cheng is really a thief.

811
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
He ran around the world.

812
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
So annoying.

813
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Can you eat Xiaoluo?

814
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
I'll watch this video.

815
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Shut up. I'm going to die.

816
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Go, go, go.

817
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Go, go, go.

818
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Go, go, go, go, go.

819
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:21,220
Lord,

820
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,080
avant-garde

821
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,780
right

822
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,160
the 되는

823
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Xiaolongxia.

824
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,920
I know.

825
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,160
I'll take your hook.

826
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,520
What's wrong?

827
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,920
The hook won your hook.

828
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,160
Hello?

829
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,320
Let's meet here later.

830
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,760
Okay.

831
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Who is it?

832
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
Su Luo.

833
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,360
If he wants to date me again,

834
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
he won't save me after that.

835
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Can't we not go?

836
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,160
If I say no, he'll come to the base.

837
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,960
Let's go.

838
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,160
Let's go to the gym.

839
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,560
We just went there.

840
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,760
We have to eat so many shrimps at night.

841
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,160
We have to exercise in advance.

842
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,560
Otherwise, we'll have to gain a few pounds tomorrow.

843
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,360
Go.

844
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,960
Yes.

845
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I'll go to exercise too.

846
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,160
I'll have some shrimps for dinner.

847
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Then I'll go to the gym with you.

848
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,360
I'll have a meeting with Mian Sheng.

849
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
You haven't been to the gym for 800 years.

850
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,760
Tell me about it.

851
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Brother Cheng.

852
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Brother Cheng.

853
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
You're not going to leave me alone?

854
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
You're so loud.

855
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Aren't you afraid of Erlong?

856
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,360
I don't want you to go.

857
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Brother Cheng.

858
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
Brother Cheng.
