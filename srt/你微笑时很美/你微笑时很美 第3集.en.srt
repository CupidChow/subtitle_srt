1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,230
No one and nothing

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,490
can be invisible online.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,620
I'm just curious,

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,110
why didn't you tell me you're a pro player?

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,010
Joining our team

6
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,280
is way better than going to ZGDX.

7
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,050
Bro,

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,350
I chose to go pro because I want to.

9
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,180
It has nothing to do with you.

10
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,700
Block me.

11
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,760
Cheng,

12
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,760
is this your girlfriend?

13
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,190
Especially not with me.

14
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,900
Smiling?

15
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,760
She must be, right?

16
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,780
Even though we can only see her back,

17
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,540
she looks really cute.

18
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,890
This girl knows Jian Yang?

19
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,940
She's only been here a few days,

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,540
and already she's going everywhere with Cheng?

21
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,900
Master Smiling,

22
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,430
we're all pretty excited

23
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,160
for your first big appearance.

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,200
[Falling into your smile]

25
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,950
[Episode 3]

26
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,000
Sis, double queue?

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,830
I'll go and take a look.

28
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,280
That's impressive.

29
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,190
Your hand speed is impressive.

30
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,070
Amazing.

31
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,610
Don't run away.

32
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,100
Wait for me.

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,980
Fight with them. I'm on my way.

34
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,270
The opponents are all there, and she dares to fight.

35
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,470
The damage is so high.

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,670
Sis,

37
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,140
stop camping. I can't hold on anymore.

38
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,070
Let's take a fight. Hold on.

39
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,020
I'll be there soon.

40
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,460
Don't do it. There are three of them.

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,720
It's fine. Let's do it.

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,400
Jump on them now.

43
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,140
I...

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,579
Pang, jump!

45
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,329
I...

46
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,470
Pang is dead.

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,870
How can you be so noob?

48
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,190
Nice!

49
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,700
That hand speed is insane.

50
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,740
Pang, group up.

51
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,010
Let's end it!

52
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,440
Use your ult! Hang in there!

53
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,740
Good, beautiful!

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,170
That's impressive!

55
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,110
Amazing.

56
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,940
Sis, what kind of monster play is this?

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,980
I feel like I just played a fake game.

58
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,579
Are you sure we were duo queuing?

59
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,660
Why do I feel like I was by myself?

60
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,600
Brother Pang,

61
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,900
you're the support,

62
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,300
you're supposed to tank the damage.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,700
Otherwise, how am I supposed to carry the team?

64
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,570
Sis,

65
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,170
I really didn't expect this.

66
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,930
You are a completely different person when you're playing the game.

67
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,150
No wonder people call you Esports Mulan.

68
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,870
You got the MVP.

69
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:01,880
That's amazing!

70
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,400
Easy peasy. Next round, let's crush it.

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,950
Alright.

72
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,300
K,

73
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,850
Our new mid laner

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
is amazing.

75
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,110
She took the whole team's gold and kills.

76
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,140
So impressive.

77
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,370
She's standing out.

78
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,010
Why worry about others?

79
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,890
It's okay, it's okay.

80
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,090
You played really well.

81
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,730
Really.

82
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,650
Come on, let's play a round.

83
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,190
Okay.

84
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,190
I'll play ADC.

85
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,770
Then I won't play.

86
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,530
I know you're going to bring up the old story.

87
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,180
Though K's approach wasn't right,

88
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,930
what he said wasn't entirely unreasonable.

89
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,850
I understand.

90
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,770
Her playstyle is too aggressive.

91
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,200
She has absolutely no sense of teamwork

92
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,530
and lacks professionalism.

93
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,330
I know.

94
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,800
You told me the same thing

95
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,070
during the test match.

96
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,600
Are you alright?

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,330
I told you I could sub in for you.

98
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,530
Why bother?

99
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,690
It's fine.

100
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,170
What do you think?

101
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,830
Her playstyle is too aggressive.

102
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,940
She has absolutely no sense of teamwork

103
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,120
and lacks professionalism.

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Professionalism can be developed.

105
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,200
She's already the best

106
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,530
out of all these people.

107
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,990
Why do we have to recruit a new player?

108
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,720
We've already discussed this.

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,159
You're our mid laner.

110
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,120
You choose

111
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,930
who will fill your position.

112
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,170
You've never asked me

113
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,580
why I chose Tong Yao.

114
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,650
Half of our team was recruited

115
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,050
based on your judgment.

116
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,370
Moreover,

117
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,290
she's taking over your mid laner role.

118
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,550
I trust your judgment.

119
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,560
I selected her from hundreds

120
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
of candidates.

121
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,810
She has a strong desire to win

122
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,260
and doesn't give up easily.

123
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
She's fearless,

124
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,300
just like you.

125
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,290
My hands are no longer able to handle competition.

126
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,760
But my decision to retire now

127
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,820
isn't entirely because of my injury.

128
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,350
This year's Spring Split saw a lot of new talent emerging.

129
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,210
If we want to make it to the finals,

130
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,250
we need fresh blood like Tong Yao.

131
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,640
Sis, you're so cool!

132
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,460
-Nice!
-Not bad!

133
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
It's risky.

134
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,760
The National League is about to start.

135
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,170
That's why I need you to train Tong Yao with me.

136
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,090
You're right.

137
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,570
She must first learn to be a professional player,

138
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,940
not just a gamer.

139
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,230
Create a training plan for her as soon as possible.

140
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,760
Let's start from tomorrow.

141
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,520
Okay.

142
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:05,930
Hello, Dad.

143
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,620
Son,

144
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,490
do you know how unreasonable your mom is?

145
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,140
I just said a few more words,

146
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,060
and your mom ran away from home again.

147
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,890
Alright, I got it.

148
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,210
I'll come home tomorrow.

149
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:14,930
Wait, son,

150
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,200
you need to help me figure out a way

151
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,320
to coax your mom...

152
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:19,650
I...

153
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,150
It's okay. Go home.

154
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,530
Don't worry.

155
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,490
I'll start training her tomorrow.

156
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,970
Tong Yao, let's start our training.

157
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,370
The first thing I want to talk about today is that,

158
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,250
as a professional esports player,

159
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,100
the ultimate goal of participating in a competition

160
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,820
isn't personal victory,

161
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,530
but team victory.

162
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,850
In this process,

163
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,050
you need to give up many habits

164
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,530
of charging in solo.

165
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,730
The first thing you need to get used to

166
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,860
is seeing yourself as a cog in the team.

167
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,670
Okay.

168
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,820
I'm ready to be a cog.

169
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,500
Then let's officially begin.

170
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,190
First, take a look at this.

171
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,330
Practice hand speed, practice last hitting,

172
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,150
and understand the game background and the characteristics of the shikigamis?

173
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,170
Aren't these too basic?

174

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,690
Is Pro Yang Jacob?

346
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,010
Lu Sicheng doesn't look like Edward.

347
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,200
I really didn't expect Pro Yang to be this kind of person.

348
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,030
Pro Yang is so corny.

349
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,170
I never thought he'd say something like that.

350
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,890
"Come on. I'll carry you."

351
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,620
That's too alpha-boss style.

352
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,530
This is why

353
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,700
professional esports teams generally don't have female players.

354
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,690
Office romances are too easy to happen.

355
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,730
I'm not against it,

356
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,910
but it's fine when they're together.

357
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,150
What if they have a fight or break up?

358
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,810
How can they still compete together afterward?

359
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,740
What are these?

360
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,330
Are they talking about Yao?

361
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,940
Didn't she go to play games?

362
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,550
How did she end up in a relationship?

363
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,210
Who are these people?

364
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,070
Why are they speaking so harshly?

365
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,630
This won't do.

366
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,540
Hello?

367
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,330
Hello, Mom.

368
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,110
Yao,

369
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,020
explain to us.

370
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,220
What's going on?

371
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,500
Why do they keep bringing up Twilight?

372
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,570
Did you go there to play games or to fall in love?

373
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,110
Mom,

374
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,130
I've told you a hundred times.

375
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,370
What more can I say?

376
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,350
There's really nothing going on.

377
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,330
I've only been here for a few days.

378
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,130
How could I possibly be in a relationship already?

379
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,390
Besides, we train for 12 hours every day.

380
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,740
I don't even have time for a relationship.

381
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,590
Well,

382
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,910
what are they talking about

383
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,070
on the Esports Farm?

384
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,590
You browse the Esports Farm?

385
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,520
How would I know what those people are saying?

386
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,020
I'd like to ask them why they see it this way.

387
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,980
Let me ask you,

388
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,050
is Pro Yang the same person as Jian Yang?

389
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,370
The one who broke up with you last year

390
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,120
and who used to live next door to us?

391
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,310
Yes.

392
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,840
Pro Yang is Jian Yang.

393
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,370
Right, he's the one who lived next door to us.

394
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,310
When I was dating him,

395
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,050
it didn't stop me from getting into college.

396
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,860
Why are you bringing up old stories?

397
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,290
I just happened to bump into him at yesterday's match.

398
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,360
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

399
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,510
Then who is Cheng?

400
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,650
Is he hitting on you?

401
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,350
Cheng is our captain.

402
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,930
He's the most innocent one.

403
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,130
Don't talk nonsense.

404
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,040
Hitting on me?

405
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,690
Do I have that kind of ability?

406
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,490
Come on.

407
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,480
Listen to me.

408
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,940
You are a young girl

409
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,030
playing esports with a bunch of boys.

410
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,210
You need to be more careful, understand?

411
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,270
Don't do anything careless that might

412
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,560
let people on the internet find dirt on you and spread rumors.

413
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,620
It'd be really bad for your image.

414
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,250
-Mom,
-Understand?

415
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,170
I have to go now.

416
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,420
Yao!

417
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,000
Cheng.

418
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,020
What?

419
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,230
Why are you back so early?

420
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,220
Shorty,

421
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,770
what's going on between you and Jian Yang from Team CK?

422
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,380
What do you mean?

423
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,250
Yesterday, the thing that the three of us ran into

424
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,120
while playing ranked was posted on the Esports Farm,

425
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,030
with full screenshots of the entire game.

426
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,760
Don't tell me you didn't see it.

427
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,570
I saw it.

428
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,850
Why do you also browse the Esports Farm?

429
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,610
There are already thousands of replies.

430
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,270
Our complicated relationship

431
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,730
is enough to write a soap opera.

432
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,650
Here's the content:

433
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,170
The female lead is completely devoted to the first male lead,

434
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,840
the second male lead desperately pursues the female lead,

435
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,370
and the first male lead is cold and heartless.

436
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,120
Come on, let's talk about it.

437
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,810
Of course we know each other.

438
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,340
We've known each other for hundreds of years.

439
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,610
Pro Yang,

440
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,370
don't be upset.

441
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,830
Have some yogurt.

442
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,390
Get lost!

443
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,410
Oh no.

444
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,620
Pro Yang is swearing.

445
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,780
Oh no.

446
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,380
A storm is coming.

447
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,220
What should we do?

448
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,070
-Go.
-Go.

449
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,940
Me?

450
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,530
Go, just go.

451
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,810
I...

452
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,000
Pro Yang.

453
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,660
Come on, tell us, what's the story

454
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,860
with you and Smiling?

455
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,140
You really want to know?

456
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,850
She's my ex-girlfriend.

457
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,670
She went pro

458
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,410
because of me.

459
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,610
Come on! Over here!

460
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,590
Team fight!

461
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,030
Everyone to the mid lane!

462
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,070
We can't beat them.

463
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,980
Run, run, run!

464
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,650
Yes, yes, yes. Fight, fight!

465
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,380
Go, go, go!

466
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,890
Go! Fight!

467
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,170
If we don't fight now, we're gonna die!

468
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,360
We can't beat them. Run, run, run.

469
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,510
Run, run, run.

470
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,070
Hurry, hurry!

471
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,650
Sorry, my girlfriend's causing trouble.

472
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,820
I'm really sorry.

473
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,580
Jian Yang,

474
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,120
you're having so much fun.

475
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,000
Why don't you teach me?

476
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,090
I'll play with you.

477
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,280
Sure, come on.

478
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,330
Sit down.

479
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,930
Which one should I choose?

480
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,200
Can I choose whichever looks good?

481
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,450
Don't move around. Choose this one.

482
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,700
The one with white hair and long sideburns.

483
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,540
That's the one.

484
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,600
This one is so ugly.

485
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,550
As long as you look good, it's fine.

486
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,170
Is there one that doesn't require running around,

487
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,350
can deal massive damage,

488
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,150
looks good,

489
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,320
has a strong presence,

490
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,080
doesn't need to pair with someone else,

491
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,540
and avoids getting roasted for being a noob?

492
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,170
Yeah, mid lane.

493
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,130
Choose Tamamo-no-Mae.

494
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,210
You need to farm minions, or you won't get any experience.

495
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:55,760
Don't use your skills.

496
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,290
Just last-hit the minions.

497
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,450
How do I last-hit?

498
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,180
What's last-hitting?

499
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,000
When the minion's health is low,

500
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,560
use an auto attack to hit it.

501
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,160
I can't hit them.

502
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,460
Are you tricking me?

503
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,900
Help! Help me!

504
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,790
I died again.

505
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,980
Why did I die again?

506
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,200
Jian Yang, if you don't come to the mid lane,

507
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,140
you won't have a girlfriend anymore.

508
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,470
I'm coming, I'm coming.

509
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Anyone who dares to lay a finger on you, I'll kill them.

510
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,410
Sweet.

511
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,000
What happened later?

512
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,140
Later,

513
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,180
I really didn't have a girlfriend anymore.

514
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,990
Jian Yang,

515
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,330
happy birthday.

516
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,260
Thank you.

517
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,590
Open it and take a look.

518
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,610
How is it? Do you like it?

519
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,910
I do.

520
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,010
I like anything you give me.

521
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,810
Come on. Let me help you put it on.

522
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,400
Let's see if it looks good on you.

523
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,700
Hurry up, put it on.

524
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,620
Are you going out?

525
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,170
School is starting soon.

526
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,450
Aren't you going to write your thesis?

527
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,720
Don't procrastinate and leave it until the last minute,

528
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,450
then beg me to help you write it.

529
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,510
What's wrong?

530
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,330
I'm not going back to school.

531
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,370
What?

532
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,430
A manager from a professional esports team noticed me

533
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,820
and asked me to go to Shenzhen for a trial.

534
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,220
If everything goes well,

535
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,450
I'll stay there and play professionally.

536
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,250
My parents have already agreed.

537
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,770
As you know, my grades aren't great,

538
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,750
and I don't know what to do after graduation.

539
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,050
But I love this profession.

540
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,110
I think I can go further in this field.

541
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,050
Later, he joined a professional team.

542
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,030
He got teammates, fans,

543
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,900
and a bright future ahead.

544
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,140
At that time, I wondered

545
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,890
if there was still a place for me beside him.

546
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,530
At first, I thought there was.

547
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,610
I actively communicated with him every day,

548
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,540
listening to him talk about winning matches

549
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,270
and how much his fans loved him.

550
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,880
Seeing the photos he sent from the events

551
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,030
felt like I was there with him,

552
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,550
witnessing his glory.

553
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,520
But I never understood that

554
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,700
no matter how close we were,

555
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,800
we could never go back to how things were before.

556
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,960
Yao, did you watch my match today?

557
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,440
Did I play well?

558
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,470
Did you see my move in the third game?

559
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,190
It was an insane blink!

560
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,570
I saw everyone praising me.

561
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,550
Yeah.

562
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,050
They were all asking where this Yang came from.

563
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,510
He was really impressive.

564
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,040
You're going to become a big star soon.

565
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,490
Come on, go go go! I have my ultimate.

566
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,650
Team fight! We can engage now!

567
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,650
We can fight. Let's go for it!

568
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,280
Come on, kill him!

569
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,790
What are you doing?

570
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,540
Getting ready to sleep.

571
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,460
I'm so tired.

572
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,690
Act composed.

573
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Sorry,

574
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,130
the number you've dialed is currently...

575
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:04,890
Jian Yang,

576
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,970
let's talk after the scrim.

577
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,650
[A New Message]

578
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:34,980
And then?

579
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,430
Then he really became a big star.

580
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,420
And then?

581
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,650
Then he stopped picking up the phone

582
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,980
and replying on WeChat.

583
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:45,910
And after that?

584
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,770
After that, we broke up.

585
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,850
That's normal.

586
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,680
Think about it.

587
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,060
It was a long-distance relationship, and both of you

588
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,170
were busy and had no freedom.

589
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,450
So all those little things

590
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,630
just got blown out of proportion.

591
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,180
Breaking up is quite normal.

592
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,630
The captain has a story.

593
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,710
Who in this business doesn't have a story?

594
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,830
Pro Yang,

595
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,780
you basically trained an enemy spy from childhood.

596
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,010
Look.

597
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,090
You first trained her to become the top Tamamo-no-Mae player in the country,

598
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,080
then broke up with her,

599
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,320
forcefully raising her hatred.

600
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,270
After that, you got her to join the opposing team,

601
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,800
turning her into your biggest weakness.

602
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,190
What kind of tragic drama script is this?

603
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,830
Pro Yang's move was impressive.

604
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,260
Come on, Pro Yang,

605
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,290
what grudges do we have with you?

606
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,780
Why did you do this to us?

607
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,830
I've confirmed.

608
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,580
He's a natural masochist.

609
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,840
Don't talk nonsense.

610
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,860
I haven't finished my story yet.

611
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,260
What if they

612
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,969
get back together?

613
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,310
Wouldn't that turn the enemy spy

614
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,780
into our spy?

615
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,650
That's good.

616
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,230
Yeah, Pro Yang.

617
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,860
Wait. Don't get too excited just yet.

618
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,120
In yesterday's match,

619
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,980
Cheng didn't say a word.

620
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,960
He's always been the tough but quiet type.

621
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,140
People online say

622
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,270
that Cheng is Edward.

623
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,830
-What?
-What does that mean?

624
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,670
What Edward?

625
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,400
Why did you bring up Cheng?

626
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,350
What Cheng?

627
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:07,910
It wasn't me.

628
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,490
Why did you bring up Cheng?

629
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,690
-I didn't...
-Why did you bring up Cheng?

630
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,550
That's what the people online said.

631
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,430
Why are you kicking me?

632
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,390
Who is Cheng?

633
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,460
So annoying.

634
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,970
Bro, we're leaving.

635
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,340
♫Breakups should be dignified♫

636
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,820
♫No one should apologize♫

637
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,950
Pro Yang, I'm sorry.

638
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,180
Come on, let's play a game.

639
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Come on, come on.

640
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,690
Yao,

641
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,690
let's get back together.

642
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,490
What's wrong?

643
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,060
It's nothing.

644
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:13,900
Cheng,

645
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,500
I've said everything I should say.

646
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,230
I didn't mention it before

647
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,340
because we've been broken up for a year.

648
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,140
I thought it had been a long time.

649
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,990
I didn't expect it to cause such a big problem,

650
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,610
and even affect you.

651
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,930
I'm not blaming you.

652
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,660
Why are you giving me that look?

653
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,730
I just feel that,

654
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,230
I just joined the team

655
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,010
and haven't achieved anything yet,

656
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,010
and now I've caused such a huge mess.

657
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,420
And yesterday I was duoing with K.

658
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,530
I was hoping to use this opportunity

659
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,190
to improve our relationship.

660
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,780
But what happened yesterday

661
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,960
seems to have made him unhappy.

662
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
It's not that bad.

663
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,610
But I heard from Pang

664
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,170
that you've never had any negative news.

665
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,220
This is the first time you've become the center of attention because of something like this.

666
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,100
I feel bad about what happened.

667
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,970
You're a girl playing professionally,

668
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,130
surrounded by guys.

669
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
It's inevitable that people would pay attention to this aspect.

670
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
I thought you had anticipated this.

671
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,190
I did,

672
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,190
but I didn't expect it to be this serious.

673
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,420
Once the novelty wears off,

674
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,440
what people will focus on

675
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,360
will be your performance and skills.

676
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,120
The earliest it could be is during

677
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,750
the National Championship,

678
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,320
but the prerequisite is that

679
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,220
you need to make it onto the stage first.

680
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,210
I swear, Cheng,

681
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,700
I will definitely make it.

682
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,140
Don't worry, Cheng,

683
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,750
I'll take good care of Pancake.

684
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,150
I'll make sure you have a big, happy family.

685
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,240
What's wrong, Cheng?

686
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,700
Why are your eyes red?

687
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,460
It's nothing, just an allergy to cat fur.

688
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,400
Honey, is the rumor true?

689
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
I'm not happy.

690
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,880
I'm upset.

691
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,070
I'm going to unsubscribe

692
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,330
and switch from being a fan to a stranger!

693
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,050
Your fans are asking you again?

694
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,710
Don't you have your own phone?

695
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,610
Actually, you don't need to care too much about what they say.

696
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,650
Many of them are just talking nonsense.

697
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,850
They won't stop loving you

698
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,610
just because you're in a relationship.

699
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,720
In the fan community,

700
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,540
fans turning into strangers and strangers turning into fans

701
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,730
is very normal.

702
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,920
Before, someone said they saw you

703
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,400
and Cheng shopping hand in hand.

704
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,530
I didn't believe it.

705
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,570
I'm so mad.

706
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,740
It's really happened.

707
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,530
Tonight,

708
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,430
I lost both my husband

709
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,620
and my wife!

710
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,820
This strange news has indeed appeared.

711
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,060
I'm a bit worried about you.

712
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,820
As the only female professional player,

713
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,980
don't let yourself fall at this very beginning stage,

714
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,630
Sis.

715
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,500
What's wrong?

716
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,280
Look.

717
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,330
It says I was shopping hand in hand with you.

718
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,100
They spread rumors without any consequences.

719
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,990
I haven't even touched your hand.

720
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,420
Now that you have, are you still feeling wronged?

721
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,270
Your cat’s going to get suffocated by you.

722
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,840
Tong Yao,

723
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,130
you used to think that, because we were in a long-distance relationship

724
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,690
and our schedules didn't match,

725
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,860
dating would be a waste of time.

726
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,470
So, you ended up finding some trivial things

727
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,400
to argue about and broke up with me.

728
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,330
Now that you're a professional player yourself,

729
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,220
you should understand the daily life of a pro player.

730
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,630
I really didn't mean to ignore you back then.

731
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,830
I didn't want to break up with you at all.

732
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,120
The karaoke room incident is already in the past.

733
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,720
I shouldn't have lied to you.

734
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,380
It was my fault.

735
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,880
I've already apologized to you.

736
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:13,810
Yao,

737
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,200
Yao, can we talk?

738
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,790
What are you doing?

739
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,730
Are you using a fake account

740
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,790
and arguing with people on the forum?

741
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,170
Am I that bored?

742
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,230
I think you are.

743
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,690
I think you are that bored.

744
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,340
How childish.

745
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,180
I think

746
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,630
it's necessary to clarify this on Weibo.

747
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,790
Clarify what?

748
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,270
That you, me, and Jian Yang

749
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,970
are definitely not some esports version of Twilight.

750
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:43,850
There's no need.

751
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,780
There is.

752
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,410
I can't just let this tarnish your reputation.

753
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,360
You should go and check the Douban fan group.

754
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,400
Nonsense. It's not true.

755
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,240
Don't make random guesses.

756
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,190
This is you?

757
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,310
Why?

758
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,410
Blocking the bullets

759
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,510
is something a man should do.

760
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,020
Cheng.

761
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,500
What? What kind of look is that?

762
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,410
Take it back.

763
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,540
Although I don't know

764
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,510
who will be lucky enough to become your Mrs. Lu in the future,

765
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,130
I'm starting

766
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,850
to feel a little envious of her now.

767
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,090
Because you'll definitely protect her well,

768
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,290
keeping her safe from any harm.

769
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,410
What Mrs. Lu?

770
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,510
Are you an idiot?

771
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,360
We scheduled a public scrim with FNATIC tomorrow.

772
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,830
It will be streamed to the fans.

773
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,960
Play well, don't embarrass yourself.

774
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,330
Pancake!

775
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,440
Jian Yang,

776
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,300
we're already a thing of the past.

777
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,430
Stop dwelling on it.

778
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,870
You and Lu Sicheng...

779
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,610
Hey, buddy.

780
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,400
Hey, Ai Jia.

781
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,410
I have something really important to ask you.

782
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,340
Is it about Tong Yao and Lu Sicheng?

783
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,660
Don't worry. There's nothing going on between them.

784
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,900
It's all just rumors online.

785
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,300
Don't take it seriously.

786
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,380
I'm going to keep playing now. Bye.
