Most of the time, esports players

spend their days silently typing on keyboards.

3
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,880
So they often forget

that they are public figures too.

Yao, did you get into a fight?

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,979
Are you okay?

10
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,450
Come on, let me say a few words.

11
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,930
Yao,

12
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,080
when you're out,

13
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,210
you need to take care of yourself.

00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,460
Don't get into conflicts with others.

I'm fine.

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,670
I know, I know. You don't need to worry about me.

18
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,840
I'll be more careful next time.

19

I have something to do, so I'll hang up now.

How was it?

21
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,270
Feels good, right?

22
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,610
I'm going to find the official blog manager to post an apology

23
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,740
and pin it to the top.

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,470
Then I'll go back and reflect on my actions.

can be solved by acting on impulse.

28
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,510
Actually, the punishment from the club

29
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,510
is quite lenient.

30
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,810
This... this is considered lenient?

31
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,090
Being banned at this stage...

The punishment can be severe or light.

Things like bans or fines

are not that serious.

A foul mouth deserves a slap. What's wrong with that?

Let Lu Yue play in the practice match too.

Apart from Ootengu and Higanbana,

can't you pick something else?

00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,890
Tong Yao, these shikigami you mentioned,

159
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,170
nobody uses them in matches.

160
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,840
What's the point of practicing them?

161
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,970
Even if others don't use them, you can.

162
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,120
Sometimes strategy is more important than version.

Look,

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,530
the opposing team picked Enenra.

165
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,530
Think about it.

166
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,210
When you play Enenra,

167
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,340
what shikigami the enemy uses

168
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,470

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,890
Cheng, pick Oitsuki for him.

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,100
Even if you're a substitute,

171
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,410
you've at least played

172
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,430
as a professional player for two seasons last year.

173
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,130
Do you still need

174
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,930
Tong Yao to tell you what to pick?

175
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,210
You're hopeless.

176
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,900
Did you hear that, Cheng?

177
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,970
Oitsuki.

178
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,510
Go, go, go!

179
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,170
He's still ignoring you, huh?

180
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,050
K, Cat, go top.

181
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
-Got it.
-Got it.

182
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,290
Don't just focus on the top lane.

183
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,450
Come and help your mid laner too.

184
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,880
Cat, I'll help you get to the top lane early.

185
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,210
He's worried about you.

186
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,520
I sat next to him during dinner today.

187
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,900
I saw with my own eyes

188
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,050
that he deleted the video of the program schedule

189
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,980
from his phone.

190
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,050
And he told me not to tell anyone.

191
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,410
What does that mean?

192
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,440
Quick, quick, help me!

193
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,650
No matter what you think,

194
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,340
first of all, Lu Sicheng is the captain of this team.

195
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,600
He has the responsibility to protect each and every one of you

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
and to keep this team out of trouble.

197
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,460
When this kid got into trouble last year,

198
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
he ran himself ragged

199
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,790
to finally suppress the issue.

200
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,490
He was punished with a temporary ban.

201
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,150
If this kind of thing blows up,

202
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,550
a lifetime ban is not out of the question.

203
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,970
So,

204
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,600
there are some things he can't help you with

205
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,980
or teach you.

206
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,310
Don't rely too much on him.

207
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,450
Do you understand?

208
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,700
Tong Yao,

209
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,090
you need to know that

210
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,180
understanding it yourself

211
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,250
-is true understanding.
-Lu Yue.

212
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,380
I've been ambushed!

213
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,920
You bunch of troublesome kids,

214
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,950
always making the captain worry.

215
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:17,930
Alright,

216
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,410
don't overthink it. Everything will pass.

217
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,900
Stay steady, stay steady.

218
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,240
Stop feeding, brother.

219
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,250
Can you not be so irritable?

220
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,850
Where's our mid laner?

221
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,250
Are you really planning to be a useless freeloader?

222
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,920
Shut up, I'm about to take off with my six-item build.

223
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
I'm starving.

224
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,610
Can we finish this game or not?

225
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,570
Come push mid.

226
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,170
Are you waiting to get caught split pushing alone?

227
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,130
Coming, coming.

228
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,620
Initiate!

229
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,740
Go, go, go!

230
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,100
I have my ultimate, go, go, go!

231
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,230
Pang, use your ultimate on me!

232
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,260
Lu Yue!

233
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,690
Where are you? Go, go, go!

234
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,490
Mid laner, go!

235
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,970
One more, one more!

236
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,920
Just one more, just one more!

237
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,000
Go, go, go! Quick!

238
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,050
-Yes!
-Nice! Yes!

239
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,440
How was that, Tong Yao?

240
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,550
Not bad, huh?

241
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,940
Ignoring your laning phase at Challenger level,

242
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,300
your last-hitting with Oitsuki was decent.

243
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,210
It's like watching our own little puppy

244
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,410
growing up.

245
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,140
What?

246
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,090
The first time, we crushed them.

247
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,480
The second time, we beat them easily.

248
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,170
The third time, we faced a bit of resistance.

249
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,790
The fourth time, we felt some difficulty.

250
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,230
Now it's a 50-50 chance.

251
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,660
Can you all wake up a bit?

252
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,490
Next time we compete with them,

253
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,630
we might not win for sure.

254
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,700
Can't you say something nice?

255
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,660
Something nice?

256
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,470
Alright.

257
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,250
From now on, outside of holidays,

258
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,260
especially during training time, whoever plays LinkGame,

259
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,970
browses Weibo or reads comics

260
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,070
will have their salary deducted.

261
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,170
Do you hear me?

262
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,090
Working out is okay, right?

263
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,760
What about mahjong? It's also competitive.

264
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,010
Mahjong is not allowed either.

265
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,080
But that's our national game.

266
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,880
Can't you be more professional?

267
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,150
When I'm resting,

268
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,730
I just watch some game videos

269
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,460
and occasionally play Gomoku.

270
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,570
That's not even a proper case of chuunibyou.

271
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,130
Can we stop chatting?

272
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,330
I'm starving.

273
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,410
Me too.

274
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,650
Let's go then. I'll treat you to dinner.

275
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,570
Okay, let's go.

276
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,930
Let's go have dinner.

277
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,470
-I'm starving.
-Let's go.

278
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,420
Hey, what are you doing?

279
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,650
I'm not going.

280
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,560
You guys go ahead. I'm not hungry.

281
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,550
I'll do livestream later.

282
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,150
My salary is almost all deducted.

283
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,220
I'm not in the mood.

284
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,250
A push costs a few hundred thousand. Isn't it expensive?

285
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,200
With that money, why not buy some handbags instead,

286
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,280
or buy a few dresses and have some fun?

287
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,430
Alright, go ahead then.

288
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,250
I'll bring you food when I come back.

289
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,100
Behave yourself during the stream.

290
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,410
Don't say anything reckless again.

291
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,220
Got it, got it.

292
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:52,780
Bye-bye.

293
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,210
Hello.

294
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,950
Is the porridge I ordered ready for takeout?

295
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,130
It'll be ready soon, sir.

296
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,850
Thank you.

297
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
Is it muted?

298
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,600
Why are only the fans entertaining themselves?

299
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,730
The streamer isn't talking.

300
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,890
Looks like she's really learned her lesson,

301
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,010
practicing seriously.

302
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,810
That's right.

303
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,370
In the past, she could never be this quiet.

304
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,660
Sir, your porridge is ready.

305
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,340
Thank you.

306
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,610
I'll head back first.

307
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,890
Let's all go back together after we finish eating.

308
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,830
The porridge will taste fishy if it gets cold.

309
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,890
You guys continue.

310
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,370
Cat,

311
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,090
do you understand Cheng's move just now?

312
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,010
What's there not to understand?

313
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,810
Cheng just hasn't eaten enough.

314
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,930
Why hit someone?

315
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,970
Why hit someone?

316
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,440
A pro player who hit someone

317
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,900
actually comes to stream.

318
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,370
I don't know why you female fans

319
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,500
are cheering about.

320
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,640
Tong Yao did hit someone.

321
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,290
Defending her teammate is no excuse.

322
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,570
These players earn millions annually.

323
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,730
An interactive game won't kill them.

324
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,510
Fussy and delicate.

325
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,660
This passerby.

326
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,760
Wait a moment, moderator. Don't ban him.

327
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,640
Let him speak.

328
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,490
Even if players earn hundreds of thousands or millions a year,

329
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,370
they don't owe you anything.

330
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,390
Being a pro player isn't like monkeys performing tricks.

331
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,740
Can't they stop if they're not feeling well?

332
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,630
What do you mean by not feeling well?

333
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,320
A bunch of internet-addicted young people

334
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,230
playing a few games,

335
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,570
earning so much money easily and still being delicate.

336
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,330
Earning so much money easily?

337
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,580
Then why don't you come and do it?

338
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
Come quickly, come on.

339
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,820
All major clubs are still recruiting for youth training.

340
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,950
Who's stopping you?

341
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,230
What's wrong with just doing an activity?

342
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,560
Everyone else can do it.

343
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,880
Suppose you have a heart condition,

344
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,290
and the PE teacher asks you to go to the playground

345
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,370
to run 1500 meters,

346
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,160
would you go?

347
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,350
Everyone else can run, but you can't?

348
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,250
I saw Pang and others did it in the end.

349
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,370
Weren't they also hugging those show girls,

350
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,370
smiling happily?

351
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,380
Should they cry instead of smiling?

352
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,000
If you really don't want to do it,

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,900
what are your ZGDX staff for?

354
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,390
Letting a team member go up and argue,

355
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,840
being used as a pawn and helping others count money.

356
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,500
Are you happy being punished after showing off today?

357
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,320
Yes.

358
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,730
I'm so happy.

359
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,020
To be honest,

360
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,530
I don't regret

361
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,370
insisting on not doing it at all.

362
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,040
It's just not appropriate.

363
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,990
What's wrong?

364
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,210
We only

365
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,300
knew it after we arrived at the scene.

366
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,010
It was a last-minute notice.

367
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,120
Rui couldn't speak up.

368
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,680
It's not his fault.

369
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,730
To be honest,

370
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,450
the only thing I regret is

371
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,910
this incident caused chaos among my teammates

372
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,310
and the club as well.

373
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,350
It made everyone get scolded along with me.

374
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,290
Yes, yes, yes.

375
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,570
I shouldn't have rushed over at that time.

376
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,050
There were so many people at the scene.

377
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,240
I should have just—

378
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,370
Back already?

379
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,270
I respect you for having guts.

380
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,320
I did wrong, really.

381
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,210
I should have calmly

382
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,370
and properly communicated with the organizers

383
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,930
about this situation.

384
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,070
Right.

385
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,250
Because in the team,

386
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,360
there were a few players who had just had physiotherapy on their hands

387
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,960
and couldn't do intense physical activities.

388
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,500
I should have communicated well with them

389
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,150
and discussed a solution.

390
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,890
It would definitely be okay.

391
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,950
Yes, yes, yes. We're all civilized people, after all.

392
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,970
Moderator, please give this passerby

393
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,330
a little red flower.

394
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,360
I think he's right to scold me.

395
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,260
I also think I was too impulsive.

396
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,740
Yes, yes, yes.

397
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,040
Like a shrew.

398
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,130
Yes, indeed.

399
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,850
It was really inappropriate.

400
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,410
I shouldn't have done it, no matter what.

401
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,530
No little red flower?

402
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,390
Then forget it.

403
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,190
Thank you, Cheng.

404
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,570
Streamer, your eyes are about to pop out

405
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,700
when you look at him.

406
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,790
You changed your tune faster than turning a page.

407
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,290
Stop talking, all of you.

408
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,619
Captain Lu Sicheng

409
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,390
hasn't spoken to me for an entire day.

410
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,890
It feels like I've fallen into an icy hell.

411
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,089
I haven't found a way to save myself yet.

412
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,300
Still trapped in the depths of hell.

413
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,770
Coax him?

414
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,490
You think he's a three-year-old?

415
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,970
How am I supposed to coax him?

416
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,730
Coax him.

417
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,450
Yes, yes, yes.

418
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,350
He's pretty good at playing Hakuro.

419
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,210
Controlling me from miles away, making me tremble.

420
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,410
This person said they're going to Cheng's room to report me.

421
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,110
Moderator, time to work!

422
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,470
Ban this person.

423
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,850
Those who try to disrupt the harmony between teammates

424
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,450
should be made an example of.

425
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,410
Shut up, you silly.

426
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,040
The system notified five minutes ago

427
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,650
that Lu Sicheng's account entered your livestream room.

428
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,130
And you're still blabbering on non-stop.

429
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,660
Are you asking for trouble?

430
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,640
Everything I said earlier was just a joke.

431
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,110
I'm going to reflect on my actions now.

432
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,060
At next Monday's regular meeting,

433
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,560
I will bring my 10,000-word self-criticism,

434
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
and deliver my most sincere speech.

435
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,650
Alright, I'm going to write my self-criticism now.

436
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,250
Ending the stream. Goodbye.

437
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,650
[The live stream is over.]

438
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,530
Idiot.

439
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:31,970
I'm so upset.

440
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,770
Will this be the opportunity

441
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,500
for Lu Yue to usurp my position?

442
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,410
And then I'll end up

443
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,490
trembling by the water dispenser for the rest of my life.

444
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,530
Then I'll become invisible in the team,

445
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,770
and my teammates will only remember me

446
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,170
when they order takeout.

447
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,950
"Hey, that one's free to order some food."

448
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,210
Those teammates of yours

449
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,390
talk so much that they'd chat with the air if they could.

450
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,410
How could they possibly ignore you and leave you alone?

451
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,740
I think you're just hungry.

452
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,580
Didn't the captain bring you some porridge?

453
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,780
Eat up and go to sleep.

454
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,070
It's just a one-game suspension; it'll be over soon.

455
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,290
Your starting position is still yours.

456
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,800
And the captain can't possibly not talk to you forever.

457
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,480
Really?

458
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,570
Your club has already

459
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,480
released the announcement,

460
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,360
hasn't it?

461
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,380
That's not what I'm asking about.

462
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,110
Just think about it.

463
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,570
If he really decided

464
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,650
to ignore you forever,

465
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,240
would he still worry if you're hungry

466
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,530
and bring you porridge?

467
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,130
He'd only want to torture you

468
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,780
and make you suffer, okay?

469
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,050
What you really care about

470
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,970
is whether the captain pays attention to you or not.

471
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,500
Now you're dragging the whole team into this.

472
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,030
Are girls in love

473
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,930
all this insecure and neurotic

474
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,960
like you?

475
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,050
I...

476
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,810
Sis?

477
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,690
Sis,

478
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,210
I thought you were in trouble,

479
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,490
but I didn't realize it was this bad.

480
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,010
What's wrong?

481
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,310
Did the captain kick you out?

482
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,940
We just witnessed your epic fail.

483
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,290
I feel sorry for you.

484
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,050
No, it's not like that, okay?

485
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,050
Where did you go after your late-night snack?

486
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,380
Why are you back so late?

487
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,190
No.

488
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,040
We didn't go anywhere.

489
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,470
We came back right after eating.

490
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,270
That's right.

491
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,560
Then how did Cheng...

492
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,440
Cheng said

493
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,000
he was afraid the porridge would smell fishy if it got cold.

494
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,290
But now it seems

495
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,670
he was probably worried you'd starve to death.

496
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,870
What did you say?

497
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,820
Say that again.

498
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,380
You two haven't talked yet?

499
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,670
No.

500
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,010
You two,

501
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,970
one is too proud,

502
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,280
the other is too tsundere.

503
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,370
Are you planning to be at odds forever?

504
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,430
Let's wait and see.

505
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,300
It's tough.

506
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,170
it's tough.

507
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,630
It's really tough.

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,490
[ZGDX vs Obsidian]

509
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,490
[2020 OPL National League Group A Round-Robin, Match 3]

510
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,310
Ladies and gentlemen, both here and watching from home,

511
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,820
good afternoon everyone.

512
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,080
This is the Onmyoji Arena

513
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,570
2020 National League group match

514
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,630
between Team Obsidian and ZGDX.

515
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,630
-I'm Dudou.
-I'm Qiu.

516
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,770
First, let's take a look at

517
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,050
the lineups for both teams.

518
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,930
It's worth mentioning that

519
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,610
today's starting mid laner for ZGDX

520
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,840
is player Lv.

521
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,680
It's been a long time

522
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,080
since we've seen Lv at a competition venue.

523
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,060
Don't worry.

524
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,480
The club has already given them a heads up.

525
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,490
They won't discuss your suspension.

526
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,370
Thank you, Rui.

527
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,040
I've always believed that Lv is

528
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,320
a very capable player.

529
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,690
But the opposing mid laner is no pushover.

530
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,360
Although Team Obsidian's record is average,

531
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,170
this player is ranked among the top five

532
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,170
mid laners in the professional league.

533
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,320
The opposing mid laner,

534
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,170
I've encountered him in ranked games.

535
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,570
He can use anything.

536
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,890
It's really troublesome for Lu Yue who specializes in only one shikigami.

537
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:49,410
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

538
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,480
They must know

539
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,960
that I'm suspended today.

540
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,080
Every player on ZGDX has fans,

541
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,830
and most of them are die-hard fans.

542
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,890
Their presence here

543
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,890
proves they haven't given up on you.

544
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,690
I've let them down.

545
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,960
Not at all.

546
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,380
Mr. Wang.

547
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,270
Yes,

548
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,960
we're at the match venue.

549
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,070
Lu Yue, are you nervous?

550
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,550
No.

551
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,300
Really? Play well, Lu Yue.

552
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,810
-No problem.
-Good luck. We're counting on you.

553
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,090
Let's see if we can defeat them this time.

554
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,810
Go, go, go!

555
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,690
Test, test.

556
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,550
Okay, okay. Can everyone hear me?

557
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,760
We can hear you.

558
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,340
Good.

559
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,240
Higanbana and Ootengu.

560
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,120
Okay.

561
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,860
Team Obsidian has banned

562
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,220
Higanbana and Ootengu.

563
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,770
These are shikigami that Lv uses very well.

564
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,130
It seems that Team Obsidian, upon learning

565
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,810
the news that Smiling

566
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,010
was suspended for this match,

567
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,050
has made targeted deployments.

568
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,860
They're really cunning.

569
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,940
Yes, let's take a look at ZGDX's side.

570
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,360
They've banned Aoandon and Tamamonomae.

571
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,480
It seems the mid lane will be explosive today.

572
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,060
To be honest,

573
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,120
I'm personally very excited for this match.

574
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,300
Yes, this match is of great significance

575
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,420
for ZGDX.

576
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,600
If they can secure a victory,

577
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,110
they will temporarily top the group

578
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,670
with a perfect record.

579
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,350
To be frank, I was originally very confident

580
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,350
about their perfect record.

581
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,300
But

582
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,550
after what happened yesterday,

583
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,950
it's quite awkward now.

584
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,850
That's right. In the past few weeks,

585
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,110
ZGDX's status was almost perfect.

586
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,790
Even someone like

587
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,530
Chessman, who rarely praises anyone,

588
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,450
was full of praise for their mid laner.

589
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,100
He said he was very confident

590
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,730
about this season's matches.

591
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,330
Now

592
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,100
it seems quite ironic.

593
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,010
Forget it.

594
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,170
We all know that ZGDX's Lv

595
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,440
has always been known for his steady gameplay.

596
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,900
But at the same time, his shikigami pool

597
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,620
has always been criticized.

598
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,110
Because it's too shallow.

599
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,420
Yes, so today,

600
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,370
with Higanbana and Ootengu banned,

601
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm very curious

602
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,880
about what shikigami he will use

603
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,300
to handle this match.

604
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,130
Lu Yue,

605
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,690
you can take Enenra.

606
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,620
No problem.

607
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,010
Pang,

608
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,390
get Enenra for Lu Yue.

609
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,490
Enenra?

610
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,490
Lv actually picked Enenra.

611
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,830
Enenra in this version

612
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,650
is a very dominant shikigami in lane.

613
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,230
Especially because it has

614
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,970
an extremely long skill range

615
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,320
to harass opponents in lane.

616
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,790
And in late-game teamfights,

617
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,910
it's also very troublesome.

618
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,730
Now that you mention it,

619
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,330
I think Enenra is indeed

620
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
very suitable for Lv to use.

621
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,700
I wonder what kind of performance

622
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,720
they will offer us.

623
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,640
Alright, now both sides have

624
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,220
completed their shikigami selections.

625
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,890
Let's take a look at

626
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,890
the final shikigami lineup.

627
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,130
On ZGDX's side, top laner Cat

628
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,790
got Karasu Tengu.

629
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,910
And K got Yasha.

630
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,600
Mid laner Lv with Enenra.

631
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,210
ADC Chessman with Hakuro,

632
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,140
and Support Pang with Ichimokuren.

633
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,320
Now let's look at Obsidian's side.

634
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,490
Top laner with Hououka, jungler with Itsumade,

635
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,200
and mid laner with Kiyohime.

636
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,030
Divine Miketsu and Kusa for the bottom lane.

637
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,450
Play steady later. Play it safe.

638
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,710
Players are ready, and the match begins.

639
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,010
K, help Cat more in the early game.

640
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,450
Okay.

641
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,780
Cheng, I'm bringing Asura this game.

642
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,010
I'm ready for your commands anytime.

643
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,690
Okay.

644
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,320
Lu Yue, don't push the lane.

645
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,950
Okay.

646
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,210
Lv's play is indeed very steady.

647
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,330
That's right, don't be too aggressive in the early game.

648
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,010
Something's happening in the mid lane. A fight has broken out.

649
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,370
They're trying to retreat to their tower,

650
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,570
but it's clearly too late.

651
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,890
Enenra blinks forward,

652
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,650
unleashing a combo of skills and taking down Kiyohime.

653
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,520
The initiation was brilliant.

654
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,880
Lv actually got the first kill.

655
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,250
Well done, Lv.

656
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,020
Not bad.

657
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,810
That was a nice play.

658
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,730
Cool move.

659
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,570
Lv's Enenra is indeed...

660
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,260
a little bit better than mine.

661
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,370
Just a little?

662
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,090
I think it's more than just a little better than yours.

663
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:52,570
Well,

664
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,930
if I played better than him,

665
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,390
I'd be a pro player, right?

666
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,110
Nice.

667
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:56,950
It's alright.

668
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,650
Lu Yue, join the team fight.

669
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,570
Take the Octopus after the fight.

670
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,530
Pang, stay close.

671
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,190
I'm coming.

672
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,930
Take down the minion.

673
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
A small-scale team fight broke out in the bottom lane.

674
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,750
Nice!

675
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,970
ZGDX got two kills.

676
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,640
They won this team fight.

677
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,590
I'll go farm some minions first.

678
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,980
Come back quickly after farming.

679
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,240
ZGDX activates the Octopus.

680
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,490
ADC, be careful not to get caught.

681
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,080
Try to move back.

682
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,200
Go, go.

683
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,880
But they're not all together.

684
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,760
Go, go, go! I've got the Octopus.

685
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,500
Lu Yue.

686
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,610
Coming, coming.

687
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,290
Lu Yue.

688
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,580
-Why is Lv still farming instead of joining the team fight?
-Lu Yue!

689
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:30,970
Wait a second, I'm coming.

690
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:31,850
Hurry up! What are you doing?

691
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,690
Rush to the team fight.

692
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,000
What kind of move is it to be obsessed with minion wave alone?

693
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,400
Lu Yue, hurry up! I'm losing blood too fast.

694
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,920
I can't hold on much longer. Hurry!

695
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,770
Control, control, control!

696
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,340
We've got control!

697
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,740
Go, go, go! We can do this.

698
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,120
Retreat.

699
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,140
Lu Yue, is your headset broken?

700
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,610
Can you listen to us or not?

701
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,210
The economic advantage they just built up

702
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,510
has been caught up by Obsidian

703
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,040
in this Octopus team fight.

704
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,140
Lv didn't

705
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,080
-cooperate well in this round.
-Calm down, Cat. Next round.

706
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,280
Adjust and continue.

707
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,780
Cat, stay with K at all times.

708
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,110
-Get ready at any time.
-Let's play the same trick.

709
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,790
Okay.

710
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,090
We can't beat them.

711
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,780
Help me!

712
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,270
Retreat! Quickly!

713
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,760
Last round. Chase them!

714
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,770
Alright, coming.

715
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,520
Come on, come on!

716
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,290
Push!

717
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,690
Let's push directly, push directly!

718
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,980
You can end this in one move.

719
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,580
It's a perfect opportunity.

720
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,910
Nice, nice!

721
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,490
Lu Yue, if you had played like this earlier, we'd have won already.

722
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,260
Exactly.

723
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,350
Seeing your substitute on stage receiving cheers,

724
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,870
while you can only sit here,

725
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,000
silently watching.

726
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,300
How does it feel?

727
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,670
I once said in a post-match interview,

728
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,490
"I'm glad to have a teammate like Smiling.

729
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,150
Because of her joining,

730
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,940
this summer, ZGDX

731
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,140
will become unprecedentedly strong."

732
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,310
But now they question my judgment.

733
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,920
They doubt if I made a mistake

734
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,950
in positioning you and Lu Yue.

735
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,630
Why?

736
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,010
Look up.

737
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,560
But I don't care if others question my judgment

738
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,610
or my decisions.

739
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,090
The key is you.

740
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,410
You're the one I care about.

741
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,140
There are seven minutes left.

742
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,060
Before the next match starts,

743
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,850
I need a reason why I won't give up on you

744
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,570
no matter what anyone says.

745
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,370
You're staring at me.

746
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,610
I can't say anything.

747
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,740
If you look at me a bit longer,

748
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,200
I won't even be able to remember my ID number.

749
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,240
Six minutes and 40 seconds left.

750
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,990
Can I ask a question?

751
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,260
In what position, from what standpoint

752
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,520
are you asking me this?

753
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,550
Your captain, your teammate,

754
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,070
or just any random person on the street.

755
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,940
Six minutes and 30 seconds.

756
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,150
What I need is an answer

757
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,750
that can convince everyone,

758
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,730
not some sweet words

759
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,020
just to appease me.

760
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,580
Please be as honest as you were during

761
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,040
yesterday's livestream.

762
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,330
Six minutes and 20 seconds.

763
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,460
Stop counting down.

764
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,710
Give me some time.

765
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,460
Or give me a hint.

766
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,920
You're asking me this so suddenly.

767
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,410
I'm not prepared at all.

768
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,850
I can't say anything.

769
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,630
Let's start with your behavior that day.

770
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,140
I hit someone.

771
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,530
Team AGI's top laner,

772
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,290
flamed others in ranked games

773
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,720
before joining the pro team,

774
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,870
and insulted his teammates in the early days

775
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,870
of his pro career,

776
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,640
saying their plays made him want to vomit.

777
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,770
He was criticized as a flamer for that.

778
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,760
Since then, everyone said he had no class.

779
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,680
They've been mocking him for two years.

780
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,950
Now, even if he streams for 10 hours a day,

781
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,020
you can't hear a single swear word.

782
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,750
He doesn't even type insults anymore.

783
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,880
What's the use of it?

784
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,220
It still can't clear his name.

785
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,660
The Captain of Team CEL

786
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,170
was blindly arrogant, neglecting his teammates

787
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,240
and skipping training while preparing for

788
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,260
the National League's final,

789
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,200
and even went out to play games with girls.

790
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,550
In the end, they were utterly defeated in the final.

791
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,940
He dove the tower, missed his ultimate, and got killed.

792
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,120
He's still being mocked for it now.

793
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,320
They say he's arrogant and deserves it.

794
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,210
Even though everyone can see that a year later,

795
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,490
his temper has greatly improved.

796
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,370
He's become low-key and restrained,

797
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,770
serious and steady.

798
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,890
What's the use of it?

799
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,550
It still can't clear his name.

800
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,090
Do you remember what I reminded you?

801
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,760
Be cautious in words and actions.

802
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,430
Anything a pro player does

803
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,010
can easily be magnified.

804
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,570
It could even end your professional career.

805
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,440
So don't stir things up yourself.

806
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,040
Where did you forget it?

807
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,780
The back of my head.

808
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,680
In yesterday's practice match,

809
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,170
Lu Yue was solo killed at 3 minutes and 50 seconds.

810
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:00,980
After that,

811
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,920
his economy never recovered in any aspect.

812
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,800
At 5 minutes and 37 seconds,

813
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,890
7 minutes and 49 seconds,

814
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,160
and 12 minutes and 11 seconds,

815
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,010
K attempted to gank mid lane three times,

816
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,050
all failed because Lu Yue habitually cowered under his own tower,

817
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,830
causing the enemy mid laner to be extremely vigilant.

818
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,960
It ended in failure.

819
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,430
In today's match,

820
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,190
just now,

821
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,200
at 12 minutes and 20 seconds,

822
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,030
after K stole the Octopus,

823
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,350
it was four of us against their five,

824
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,500
but their ADC in the early game

825
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,950
was suppressed by me to the point of being useless,

826
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,040
falling behind in both equipment and economy.

827
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,650
Coming, coming.

828
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,310
So we could handle a 4v5 fight.

829
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,530
Even if we were surrounded by Obsidian,

830
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,280
we still had a good chance of winning.

831
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,180
At the crucial moment,

832
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,610
Lu Yue couldn't keep up with the pace.

833
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,210
He went to clear a minion wave in the mid lane.

834
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,420
As a result, we were one man short.

835
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,450
-Three against five.
-Can you listen to us or not?

836
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,180
Lu Yue, is your headset broken?

837
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,480
Retreat.

838
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,320
This was against Obsidian.

839
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,370
If it were CK or YQCB,

840
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,460
we would have lost.

841
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,430
Any ideas?

842
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,830
Poor coordination.

843
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,940
Why is the coordination poor?

844
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,630
Because during practice matches,

845
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,810
you habitually push the opponent under their tower.

846
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,570
Because of you, K

847
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,030
has developed a habit of counter-jungling.

848
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,550
Tong Yao, step back a bit.

849
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,480
Kosode no te will come to gank you.

850
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,000
K, come support quickly.

851
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,610
Coming.

852
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,450
She has a rather aggressive playstyle,

853
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,590
prone to impulsiveness.

854
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,270
But her judgment accuracy is still quite high.

855
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,220
When she crosses the river,

856
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,080
I'll be ready to ambush for her.

857
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,180
It's precisely because K changed to adapt to your playstyle.

858
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,440
When Lu Yue came on, he couldn't adapt immediately.

859
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,230
If it had been you in that teamfight just now,

860
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,520
you would have engaged directly.

861
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,240
So it caused them

862
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,790
to engage without hesitation as well.

863
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,480
Why?

864
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,630
Habitual coordination.

865
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,490
Where did this habitual coordination come from?

866
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,140
Quick, follow up. Tong Yao has jumped in.

867
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,740
Come on, keep up, follow her.

868
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,860
Nice.

869
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,030
Nice.

870
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,889
Regular practice matches and ranked duo queue.

871
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:12,429
The team and teammates have made changes to adapt to you.

872
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,230
How can you be so irresponsible?

873
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,159
Do you still think

874
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,409
that the suspension only affects you?

875
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,429
You made a mistake,

876
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,520
and accepted the punishment.

877
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,699
And this matter should be over just like that?

878
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,570
When you sat there watching your teammates compete,

879
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,770
have you ever thought

880
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,510
that your teammates are being punished just like you?

881
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,870
They have to consider

882
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:31,800
the training they did with you as wasted effort,

883
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,730
and start adapting all over again.

884
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,270
If you don't learn your lesson from the first suspension,

885
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,110
continue recklessly doing things

886
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,510
and get suspended again,

887
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,420
will the team still use you?

888
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,429
Will you be allowed to participate in future practice matches?

889
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,139
Should you be invited to ranked games?

890
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:46,929
Does the team have to

891
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,810
change its style again because of you?

892
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,110
There are many skilled players in this game.

893
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,100
Even more are waiting for their chance to take your place.

894
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,650
Should we continue using you,

895
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,530
or use Lu Yue,

896
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,250
or should we recruit a new mid laner?

897
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,390
Lu Yue was suspended due to impulsiveness,

898
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,650
and affected God Ming.

899
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,550
He cost us our chance to participate in the national finals.

900
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,230
He came back this time in disgrace.

901
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,720
His teammates chose to forgive him.

902
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
You can go ask him

903
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,350
if he has forgiven himself now.

904
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,310
Any ideas?

905
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,780
Onmyoji Arena is a team game.

906
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,030
In esports,

907
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,960
there's no individual heroism.

908
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,040
Three minutes left.

909
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:29,990
I've said it,

910
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,900
I don't care what others think.

911
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,400
What I care about is how you view yourself.

912
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,780
Continue or give up?

913
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,230
Professional competitions

914
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,430
are not for casual play or willfulness.

915
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,370
A pro player's career is short.

916
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,360
The peak is even more fleeting.

917
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,850
You can't afford to waste your own time,

918
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,510
let alone waste others' time.

919
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,250
And I am the team captain.

920
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,650
Young lady,

921
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,940
I don't care what you think,

922
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,960
but I'm certain that

923
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,020
ZGDX, as a top professional team,

924
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,540
recruited you to play in competitions.

925
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,290
In this field, there might be some people who

926
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,470
treat you differently because you're a girl.

927
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,310
They might look down on you,

928
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,900
discriminate against you, or idolize you.

929
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,630
They might protect or pity you.

930
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,980
But I won't.

931
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,540
Once you put on the team uniform,

932
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,010
in my eyes,

933
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,800
it's an identity that has nothing to do with gender:

934
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,460
teammate.

935
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,250
Cheng.

936
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,680
Cheng, open the door.

937
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,610
Time's up.

938
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,510
It seems you still have nothing to say to me.

939
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,980
I can't say sweet words,

940
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,730
nor will I apologize for no reason.

941
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,570
I only know that

942
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,350
I want to win every game with you all.

943
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,860
I don't want to miss any of it.

944
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,210
I don't want to disappoint you again.

945
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,810
I don't want to be a stumbling block for anyone.

946
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,590
I want to be your teammate,

947
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,960
until one day

948
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,090
we can stand at the peak of the world

949
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,170
we all aspire to reach.

950
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,970
I know you've been through a lot.

951
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,240
You were just defending your teammate.

952
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Why should you be treated like this?

953
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,860
Everyone is grateful for your defense.

954
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,620
That's why we eventually played that game,

955
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,040
to help reduce the negative comments about you

956
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,640
and try to get more evidence.

957
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,570
And me,

958
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
I'm also grateful for your defense.

959
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,180
But I'm not asking you to dull your edges.

960
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,960
Young lady,

961
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,320
I just want you to know that

962
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,250
when protecting others,

963
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,680
you need to learn to protect yourself first.

964
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,070
When will I be able to protect myself?

965
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,760
When you become strong enough one day,

966
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,220
that no one can defeat you.

967
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,800
Captain.

968
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,080
Cheng.

969
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,530
What are you doing?

970
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,660
It's about to start.

971
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,550
I'm going to play.

972
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,170
Cheng,

973
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,840
are you that kind of person too?

974
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,620
What?

975
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,220
Strong enough to fear nothing.

976
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,690
I'm not.

977
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,120
I also have fears,

978
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,570
hesitations,

979
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,750
and moments when I don't know what to do.

980
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,330
Cheng,

981
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,910
one last question.

982
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:34,780
Go ahead.

983
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,860
You've been ignoring me these days.

984
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,940
Is it just because you're angry

985
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,400
or is there another reason?

986
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,220
Because I'm afraid.

987
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,530
My dear captain, it's about to start.

988
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,360
Afraid of softening my heart.
