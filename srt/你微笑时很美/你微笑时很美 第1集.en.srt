Hello, my esteemed fans,

Today is yet another day full of surprises.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,110
The famous Team ZGDX in our circle

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,660
officially begins its journey to the spring finals today.

Same old. Same old.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,510
According to reliable sources,

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,470
the hand injury of ZGDX's mid laner

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,750
has reached a point where he can't handle

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,680
high-intensity matches anymore.

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,050
Despite that,

13

ZGDX

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,350
still has no intention of calling back their substitute, Lv.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,410
This essentially confirms the rumor

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,230
that ZGDX is finally going to welcome a new mid laner.

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,430
However, as we all know,

18

besides being handsome,

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,510

The point is, why isn't this scammer typing in Chinese?

154

The two teams participating in the showdown

are Team ZGDX and Team CK.

173

Yet, it was still discovered.

339

That's not very nice, is it?

350

You should at least consider Ai Jia's feelings.

351

The popularity of CK's ace jungler

499
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,300
is incredibly high.

500
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,790
No wonder he's the heartthrob of countless girls.

501
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,510
God Yang! God Yang! God Yang!

502
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,720
I just noticed your emotions fluctuated.

503
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,140
Consider this a warning.

504
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,030
You're overthinking it, sister.

505
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,910
Next, let's welcome ZGDX with a round of applause.

506
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,510
Top laner: Cat.

507
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,250
Mid laner: God Ming.

508
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,510
Jungler: K.

509
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,810
Support: Pang.

510
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,330
God of ADC, Lu Sicheng.

511
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,570
We can feel the enthusiasm of the fans,

512
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,720
making the temperature in our venue

513
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,970
rise by several degrees.

514
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,620
Now, let's interview God Yang.

515
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,430
Before the match,

516
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,370
do you have anything to say to the audience?

517
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,860
Fans of Team CK,

518
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,270
please cheer for us with all your heart.

519
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,740
We won't let you down.

520
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,090
CK! God Yang! God Yang!

521
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,150
Next,

522
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,950
let's interview Captain Cheng.

523
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,270
As the captain of ZGDX,

524
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,110
before the match,

525
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,640
do you have anything to say to your teammates?

526
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,230
Play well.

527
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,230
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

528
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,270
Our Cheng is truly inscrutable.

529
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,270
The competition is about to begin.

530
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,230
Let's look forward to their brilliant performance.

531
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,510
Go for it!

532
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,950
Go for it!

533
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,390
Alright,

534
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,550
the audience here and those watching at home,

535
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,880
hello everyone.

536
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,690
This is the 2020 Spring Finals

537
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,750
of Onmyoji Arena.

538
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,660
I'm the commentator, Dudou, who has been commentating

539
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,370
the entire Spring season but still hasn't made it big

540
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,230
I'm Xiaofan, today's commentator.

541
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,590
Let's watch it together.

542
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,270
Our players

543
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,630
have already entered the competition area.

544
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,430
That's right.

545
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,170
Xiaofan, take a bold guess.

546
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,030
Today, CK is facing off against ZGDX.

547
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,270
Who do you think will win?

548
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,630
Well, as things stand now,

549
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,430
these two teams

550
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,310
have completely different playstyles.

551
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,570
Although they're both veteran teams,

552
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,030
their styles are quite different.

553
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,590
I'm guessing CK will win.

554
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,390
Okay, CK.

555
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,130
But I'm not so sure about that.

556
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,880
ZGDX is currently ranked first in points.

557
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,220
I think they have a high chance of winning.

558
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,390
Well, let's wait and see.

559
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:47,990
We'll see.

560
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,150
Alright, next,

561
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,910
let's turn our attention to the audience.

562
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,040
Let's see who the lucky person is that our director has found today.

563
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,620
Who could it be?

564
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Let's take a look.

565
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,350
Kiss, kiss!

566
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,430
That's some serious PDA right there!

567
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,510
It's too much!

568
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,710
Come on, director, let's continue.

569
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,270
Alright, let's keep going.

570
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,080
This time, it's two young ladies.

571
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,840
Quick, look at the screen!

572
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
The director is stirring things up!

573
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,110
Does the director have some ulterior motives?

574
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,710
All the girls here are beautiful.

575
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,270
They're covering their faces when the camera finds them.

576
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,270
God Yang, have you seen a ghost?

577
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,910
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

578
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,110
You spilled water all over my keyboard!

579
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,910
Why did she come to Shanghai?

580
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,670
Who?

581
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,140
My ancestor.

582
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,070
Ancestor?

583
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,560
That's good!

584
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,710
May your ancestor bless you to win the match!

585
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,230
It's an ancestor who's come to collect a debt.

586
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,400
The kind that prays for my limbs to be broken.

587
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,670
That's intense.

588
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,710
Your ex?

589
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,210
Alright, the match officially begins.

590
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,250
First, we enter the ban and pick phase.

591
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,040
For

592
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,270
many of the new players,

593
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,270
let's explain it a bit.

594
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,110
Ban and pick means

595
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,790
banning and choosing shikigami.

596
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,250
Coach, Yamakaze is very strong in this version.

597
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:50,960
Let's ban it.

598
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,760
Ban Yamakaze.

599
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,670
Team ZGDX first chooses to

600
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,350
ban the powerful Yamakaze of this version.

601
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,610
Ban K's Kosode-no-te.

602
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,100
If he chooses it, the front will be hard for us to crack.

603
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,430
Okay.

604
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,460
Ban Divine Miketsu.

605
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,310
Goodbye.

606
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,690
Ban Enma.

607
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,260
The two teams then banned

608
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,100
Kosode-no-te, Divine Miketsu, and Enma respectively.

609
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,620
CK should ban Aobozu.

610
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,000
Let's ban Satori.

611
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,190
Perfect.

612
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,950
Use the last ban on Aobozu.

613
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,590
Okay.

614
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:21,710
Alright.

615
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,950
Now, both sides have entered the pick phase.

616
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,550
Old Cat, pick Menreiki for God Ming.

617
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:25,880
Okay.

618
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,560
Their first choice is

619
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,350
the powerful Menreiki in this version.

620
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,190
At this moment,

621
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,470
I think CK should choose a

622
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,500
shikigami that can counter Menreiki。

623
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,710
When facing Menreiki, who

624
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,770
is relatively weak in the early game,

625
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,500
I would pick Tamamo-no-Mae.

626
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,070
God Yang.

627
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,870
You choose Tamamo-no-Mae.

628
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,590
Yes, I've even watched her matches.

629
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,830
I've witnessed her godlike plays.

630
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,420
she's really, really impressive

631
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
and has a great sense of the game.

632
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:45,990
Right?

633
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,990
If she's not targeted in the early game

634
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,700
and allowed to farm…

635
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,230
God Yang.

636
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,190
God Yang.

637
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,370
What are you thinking? Lock it in!

638
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,230
What is God Yang hesitating about?

639
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,640
He hasn't locked in yet.

640
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,590
Just pick Tamamo-no-Mae.

641
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,720
Tamamo-no-Mae! Tamamo-no-Mae!

642
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,670
Tamamo-no-Mae! Tamamo-no-Mae!

643
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,590
Oh my god, what just happened?

644
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,800
God Yang actually picked Ootengu!

645
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,190
It's like his hand suddenly trembled.

646
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,230
Oh my. What did you pick?

647
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,200
What the heck are you doing?

648
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,430
-It's over.
-I don't understand.

649
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,460
I really had to make a wish to get here.

650
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,070
Alright, alright. Everyone calm down. Let's play well.

651
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,710
God Ming, what strategy is that, picking Ootengu?

652
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,510
I don't understand.

653
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,030
Maybe he's giving us a headstart to increase the game's difficulty.

654
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,290
Maybe his hand trembled and misclicked.

655
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,090
Everyone shut up.

656
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,950
It's starting.

657
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,780
Come on! Come on!

658
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,710
Come on! Come on! Come on!

659
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,270
Bottom lane, stay steady. Play it safe.

660
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,770
Don't come over.

661
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,700
God Yang, help me hide in the grass.

662
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,040
Okay, I'm coming.

663
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,130
God Yang! God Yang! God Yang!

664
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,320
Floret is intentionally feeding damage to God Ming.

665
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,690
God Yang, what are you doing?

666
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,750
It's okay, it's okay, don't panic.

667
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,950
God Yang, don't go in.

668
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,870
Go in.

669
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,480
I'm here.

670
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,610
But God Ming's skill landed on the ZGDX side,

671
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,330
and with a full combo from K, Jian Yang is down.

672
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,340
Congratulations, congratulations.

673
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,140
Cool. Nice!

674
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,470
-Nice.
-Pro Ming. Nice!

675
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,390
But we don't know what happened to Jian Yang.

676
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,790
He really seems to be completely off his game.

677
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,390
God Yang, what are you doing?

678
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,580
Alright, God Yang has respawned again.

679
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,560
He's arrived at his own jungle,

680
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,550
but little does he know that K and Cat are waiting to ambush him.

681
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,810
The two of them suddenly strike.

682
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,010
A perfect combo attacks God Yang again.

683
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,310
We can also see

684
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,630
it is very tacit coordination.

685
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,090
At the same time, God Yang was a bit careless.

686
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,640
K's aggressive moves killed God Yang again.

687
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,710
God Yang got caught while counter-jungling and was killed again.

688
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,830
God Yang's condition is really not good today.

689
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,490
What is Jian Yang doing today?

690
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,020
I guess his hand is cramping.

691
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,220
Zero kills, eight deaths, two assists.

692
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,170
These stats are really suffocating.

693
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,430
God Yang, I beg you, stop feeding.

694
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,130
Don't panic, don't panic.

695
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,430
After this team fight, we can take the Orochi.

696
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,650
We can still turn this around.

697
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,600
Let's go for the Orochi together.

698
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,000
Roger!

699
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,630
Copy that.

700
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,060
K, get your Subdue ready.

701
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,900
I'm coming.

702
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,130
They're taking Orochi. Should we harass them?

703
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,810
God Yang.

704
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,350
God Yang, wait for us!

705
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,790
Jian Yang marked Lu Sicheng with his first skill,

706
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,430
but Lu Sicheng easily dodged it.

707
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,110
Is he trying to fight three-on-one?

708
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,770
God Yang is killed once again.

709
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,460
God Yang's move was really too impulsive this time.

710
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,310
Pang, follow me.

711
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,470
Cat, K, get ready to flank from behind.

712
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,750
Okay, got it.

713
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,090
Come on, retreat, retreat.

714
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,170
ADC, ADC retreat. We can't fight.

715
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,360
Cheng is hacking, huh?

716
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,590
After instantly killing Jian Yang, he went on to kill

717
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,910
Butterfly and Luck.

718
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,670
Pang slowed down Wang and Floret.

719
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,790
K lands his first skill on Floret,

720
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,550
follows up with the second skill, and pops his ultimate. Beautiful!

721
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,470
Floret was instantly killed.

722
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,710
They still want to leave.

723
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,870
Let's see what choice they make.

724
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,550
Yes.

725
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,950
They're coming in strong. This looks like a push.

726
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,550
One push to the high ground.

727
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,150
Here comes the final push.

728
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,350
Go to the high ground!

729
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,630
The minion wave is entering.

730
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,110
The mid lane high ground tower has fallen.

731
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,030
The enemy team is still respawning.

732
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,360
Can we end it in one push?

733
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,350
Beautiful!

734
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,590
-They won the first round.
-Congratulations to ZGDX.

735
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,170
ZGDX is awesome.

736
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,310
Yeah!

737
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:10,989
Let's go.

738
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:11,710
Thanks, God Yang.

739
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,030
What were you thinking about?

740
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,820
Let's go.

741
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,850
-What's wrong with Captain today?
-God Yang.

742
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,070
What's wrong with him?

743
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,800
I don't know.

744
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,870
What's going on?

745
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,730
He really hasn't improved at all.

746
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,949
His ex-girlfriend came to watch the match.

747
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,810
He must be under a lot of pressure.

748
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,550
Say,

749
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,179
ZGDX invited you to watch the match this time.

750
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,909
Could there be some ulterior motive?

751
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,670
Go away.

752
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,840
Put away all your weird conspiracy theories.

753
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,500
Hold this for me.

754
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm going to the restroom.

755
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,170
Are you going to the bathroom?

756
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,600
My kidneys aren't good.

757
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,480
Thank you, God Yang.

758
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,190
Could you please sign this for me?

759
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,820
Tong Yao.

760
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,330
I'm sorry, excuse me.

761
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,310
Why did he leave?

762
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:49,830
God Yang.

763
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,429
-Who is that girl?
-Tong Yao.

764
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,840
What a coincidence.

765
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,070
What brings you to Shanghai?

766
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,230
Did you come to watch my match?

767
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,230
Watch your match?

768
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,510
I saw you earlier.

769
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,420
I figured you'd come to the restroom,

770
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,080
so I came here waiting for you.

771
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,370
Do you need something?

772
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,860
Not really.

773
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,210
I just wanted to ask you

774
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,240
how you've been lately?

775
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,970
Pretty good.

776
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,120
Are you still upset with me?

777
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,700
I really didn't mean to not call you at that time.

778
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,710
During our training camp,

779
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,830
all our phones were taken away

780
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,850
and kept by the coach.

781
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,980
Jian Yang, I'm really not upset with you.

782
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,110
I just want to calmly tell you

783
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,340
that we're over.

784
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,950
You don't need to explain these things to me.

785
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,730
No, Yao.

786
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,550
-Don't…
-Stop.

787
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,670
Don't call me that.

788
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,910
It sounds awkward.

789
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,870
Do you have anything else?

790
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,630
If not, I'll be going now.

791
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,650
Tong Yao.

792
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,300
Wait, you're a girl.

793
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,780
If you didn't come here to watch my match,

794
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,510
what else could you be here for?

795
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,510
Although I don't need to explain it to you,

796
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,780
I'll tell you anyway.

797
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,750
I came here

798
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,870
because ZGDX wanted to recruit me to play professionally.

799
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,060
Don't be ridiculous.

800
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,300
How could a girl like you play professionally with us?

801
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,560
Jian Yang, why are you still so immature?

802
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,420
Why can't women play professionally?

803
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,270
Your own embarrassing performance just now

804
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,300
wasn't shameful enough?

805
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,230
You have the nerve to criticize me?

806
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,670
Mannendake.

807
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,750
God Yang actually chose

808
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,510
his signature shikigami, Mannendake.

809
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,810
Why did God Yang, despite being at a disadvantage in this version,

810
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,850
still choose

811
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,990
his signature shikigami, Mannendake?

812
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,390
It's because Mannendake

813
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,500
requires very precise control and timing

814
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,720
-Yeah.
-when initiating team fights.

815
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,190
If you don't gain an advantage in the early game,

816
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,730
and if you try to target the enemy's core positions in the late game

817
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,100
it'll actually be a very difficult task.

818
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,300
If ZGDX doesn't establish an advantage in the early game,

819
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,630
it will be very difficult to play in the late game.

820
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,910
Go, go, go, go!

821
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,880
Don't push forward directly.

822
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,470
Get him, get him!

823
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,390
Fall back, fall back, fall back!

824
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,150
Come on, keep up, keep up!

825
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,310
The enemy jungler has started the top lane Kirin.

826
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,550
God Ming, Cat, be careful in a moment.

827
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,660
Alright, understood.

828
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,800
I'll go ambush them. You guys look for opportunities.

829
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,460
Was that last move due to God Ming's hand injury?

830
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,310
K, God Yang is not in his own jungle.

831
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,220
You need to be careful.

832
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:42,770
Okay.

833
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,390
Is the exciting part coming?

834
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,310
The bottom lane Kirin has been stolen.

835
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,110
Here it comes.

836
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,150
God Yang, who got the Kirin, has gained the upper hand.

837
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,550
Beautiful, first blood secured.

838
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,950
God Yang has taken out K.

839
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,820
K, stay steady.

840
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,630
Let's buy time and focus on farming first.

841
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,560
Let's see what God Yang is up to now.

842
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,700
He's shown up on vision.

843
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,580
God Ming, move to the left.

844
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,640
Jian Yang is in the bush to your right.

845
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,550
Looks like God Yang is about to make a move.

846
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,710
Floret, go and bait God Ming.

847
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,370
Okay, okay.

848
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,570
Floret is baiting.

849
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,220
God Yang has used his ultimate.

850
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,790
Floret, go in!

851
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,540
Roger that.

852
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,110
Wait, why is Cheng coming to mid lane?

853
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,630
Yeah.

854
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,370
Beautiful, as expected of our Cheng.

855
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,220
So impressive! In a 1v2 situation,

856
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,990
he managed to dodge 80% of the skills.

857
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,430
Why didn't you say Cheng was coming to mid lane?

858
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,070
You're muted?

859
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,150
I saw Pang in the lane.

860
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,210
I thought Cheng had gone back to base.

861
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,350
After gaining a local advantage,

862
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,150
the opponent chooses to push forward.

863
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,500
This game has already reached the mid-game.

864
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,790
If it drags on any longer, it won't be good for CK.

865
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,150
Cheng, I'm going to steal an Octopus.

866
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,230
-Go.
-CK won't be able to beat ZGDX

867
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,150
if they don't pull a surprise move.

868
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,260
Look, it seems K has an idea.

869
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,790
He went to the direction of the Octopus.

870
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,600
K's distraction is good.

871
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,750
K has gone to take the Octopus.

872
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,820
Should we fight or steal the Octopus?

873
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,730
God Yang, make a decision quickly.

874
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:12,950
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

875
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,580
Steal the Octopus.

876
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,600
CK surprisingly didn't forcefully attack the base,

877
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,310
but instead, they went back to take the Octopus.

878
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,430
K, surround them.

879
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:18,920
I'm coming.

880
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,550
Let's end this quickly.

881
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,430
God Yang, they've caught up.

882
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,400
Do we fight or not?

883
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,220
Prepare for a counter-kill.

884
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,270
God Yang has already used his ultimate and got on the wall,

885
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,220
ready to initiate the team fight.

886
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,970
Kill God Ming first.

887
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,870
God Ming, be careful.

888
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,350
They quickly infiltrated the enemy's formation.

889
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,350
God Ming was instantly killed.

890
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,580
God Ming's reaction was half a beat too slow.

891
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,790
Spread out. Spread out.

892
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,310
Find a position. Find a position.

893
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,440
I have my ultimate. I have my ultimate!

894
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,790
God Yang and his team are on a killing spree.

895
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,590
Cat was also taken out by Butterfly.

896
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,170
If they had released the shield earlier,

897
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,670
they could've withstood this wave of damage.

898
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,930
Now, ZGDX is in danger.

899
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,110
God Yang used his first skill, followed by his second skill.

900
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,910
A plain attack.

901
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,950
Triple kill!

902
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,430
ZGDX has been wiped out.

903
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,670
Alright, we can see CK

904
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,530
has already entered ZGDX's base.

905
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,630
They're calmly destroying it.

906
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,710
ZGDX has no chance.

907
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,270
Congratulations to CK for winning the second game.

908
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,800
The score is now tied at 1-1.

909
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,180
Beautiful.

910
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,700
Beautiful, beautiful.

911
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,670
We won.

912
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,900
♫All panic started because of you♫

913
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,670
♫Lost in your beauty♫

914
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,300
Come on, come on, come on.

915
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,300
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

916
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,310
♫I'm trapped, there's no turning back this time♫

917
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,230
Alright, the third round officially begins.

918
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,310
God Yang is really targeting God Ming.

919
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,030
If he's not going to catch him,

920
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,560
he's on his way to catch him.

921
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,750
Cat, K, come help for a bit.

922
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,230
Coming.

923
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,190
Cat and K…

924
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,270
Come on, go, go, go.

925
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,830
Be careful, be careful.

926
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,590
Fall back, fall back, fall back.

927
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,110
-They are fighting.
-Floret is targeting Pro Ming again.

928
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,950
K turned back to shield for God Ming.

929
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,910
Yes, yes, this position is good for a fight.

930
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,620
Good, good.

931
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,030
God Ming killed Floret.

932
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,870
My goodness, this coordination was brilliant.

933
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,110
Take the chance to attack the Orochi.

934
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,750
Yes, yes, come on, come on.

935
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,210
Let's fight. Let's fight.

936
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,990
I really didn't expect this.

937
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,540
Not only did God Ming's mentality not collapse at this round…

938
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,340
Let's group up for the Orochi.

939
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,270
Pang, come with me.

940
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,950
Roger that.

941
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,430
ZGDX is taking advantage while CK's team is not complete.

942
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,420
They're preparing to take on the Orochi.

943
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,870
If they can secure this Orochi,

944
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,540
I think the spring season championship

945
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,390
will be in the bag.

946
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,060
They're taking the Orochi.

947
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,720
God Yang, are you going or not?

948
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,610
I'm going, I'm going.

949
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,030
Let's go, let's go.

950
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,830
Together, together.

951
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,670
Pang, protect God Ming.

952
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,350
Stand on his left side.

953
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,190
Okay.

954
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,150
Go ZGDX, go ZGDX!

955
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,350
The rest of CK's team is also approaching the snake pit.

956
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,410
The opponents have disappeared.

957
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,210
Watch out for the bushes.

958
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,350
Hurry, hurry, attack, attack, attack!

959
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,240
There's a chance.

960
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,780
Beautiful, God Yang's Orochi stealing

961
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,420
is impressive.

962
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:17,980
Cool.

963
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,030
They've regained control of this match.

964
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,990
Luck, initiate the team fight.

965
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,990
Spread out, spread out.

966
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,110
They got the Orochi. Fall back.

967
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,300
I'll cover for you guys. You guys retreat!

968
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,700
After snatching the Orochi, a team fight erupted.

969
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,830
ZGDX didn't linger in the fight.

970
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,700
Wang, protect the ADC.

971
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,430
Alright.

972
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,240
Both sides exchanged skills.

973
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,560
Come on, go, go, go!

974
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,270
I'm coming!

975
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,860
Surprisingly, God Ming made a mistake here.

976
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,830
Has his hand injury flared up again?

977
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,870
Luck's Kuro

978
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,410
is slowly moving forward and looking for a position.

979
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,390
Pang countered and controlled Luck's Kuro.

980
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,250
Stay calm. Everyone, don't rush.

981
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,630
Butterfly, watch your position!

982
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,110
Got it, got it.

983
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,870
If I remember correctly,

984
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,750
K's ultimate should still be on cooldown, right?

985
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,280
This command is a bit risky.

986
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,590
Floret, deal damage! Quickly!

987
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,030
Okay, okay.

988
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,230
Lu Sicheng suddenly activates his ultimate

989
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,270
and takes down Wang and Butterfly,

990
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,630
completing a double kill.

991
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,410
So, now only Jian Yang and Lu Sicheng are left on the field.

992
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,940
Let's see how they'll play.

993
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,300
Jian Yang killed Lu Sicheng.

994
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,150
ZGDX was wiped out!

995
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,830
Jian Yang's quadra kill, oh my god!

996
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,130
What a pity!

997
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,370
CK pushed to the high ground in one go.

998
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,830
ZGDX couldn't turn the tide.

999
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,710
Okay, we can see

1000
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,310
God Ming is about to respawn.

1001
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,970
Does ZGDX still have a chance?

1002
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,630
It's all over in one push.

1003
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,020
God Ming's Higanbana has respawned.

1004
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,150
No chance.

1005
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,580
Congratulations to Team CK.

1006
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,170
Beautiful!

1007
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,560
Champions, champions, champions!

1008
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:40,820
God Yang, God Yang, God Yang! Champions, champions, champions!

1009
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,210
Champions, champions, champions!

1010
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:55,630
Champions, CK! Champions, CK!

1011
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,730
Are you okay?

1012
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,050
I let you all down.

1013
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

1014
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:41,230
CK, CK, CK!

1015
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,720
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1016
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:12,750
God Ming is back.

1017
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,370
What's wrong?

1018
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:14,500
Why did he come back?

1019
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:15,270
Is something wrong?

1020
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,270
Have a seat first.

1021
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,580
Today,

1022
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:27,730
I have some words of apology I'd like to say to everyone.

1023
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,260
Some of you may already know.

1024
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,150
I…

1025
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,330
have finally decided

1026
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,390
to temporarily leave this stage.

1027
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,660
A few years ago,

1028
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,830
I was

1029
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,570
just a rookie who had joined a professional team.

1030
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,510
Yes,

1031
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,890
when I was about your age.

1032
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:49,830
Back then,

1033
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,430
in most people's eyes,

1034
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,270
playing games was considered a waste of time

1035
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,510
and had no future.

1036
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,660
Of course,

1037
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,640
my family thought the same way.

1038
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,160
They would ask me with doubt,

1039
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,310
"What is esports?"

1040
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,250
"Does esports have a future?"

1041
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,910
At that time,

1042
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,230
I really didn't know how to answer.

1043
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,080
But seeing their looks,

1044
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,630
I felt defiant.

1045
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,470
Because my heart told me

1046
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,940
this was my dream.

1047
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,420
Professional esports

1048
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,350
would surely have a bright future.

1049
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,780
For this,

1050
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,240
I argued with my family,

1051
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,110
gave them the silent treatment,

1052
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:26,390
and even left without saying goodbye.

1053
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,270
I boarded a train to Shenzhen

1054
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,210
and joined Team ZGDX,

1055
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,580
becoming a professional esports player.

1056
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,630
During this brief yet long struggle,

1057
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,720
I fought along with Lu Sicheng,

1058
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,270
Cat, K, and Pang from our team.

1059
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,910
We fell down

1060
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,830
and got back up again.

1061
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,550
It was through these repeated

1062
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,920
moments of glory and low points

1063
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,880
that I found my place and direction in life.

1064
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,930
But regrettably,

1065
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,270
today,

1066
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,800
I have to put my dream aside.

1067
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,850
The failure in today's match

1068
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,230
is telling me

1069
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,030
it's time to let go of

1070
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,190
my persistence, which can only move myself now.

1071
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,460
It's time to make way for fresh blood.

1072
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,440
Although I can't do it,

1073
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,820
I know,

1074
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,860
as long as the dream lives on,

1075
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,190
someone

1076
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,790
will stand on this stage to replace me

1077
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,360
and carry on my dream.

1078
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,630
And this person…

1079
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,410
I hope she can make a decision quickly.

1080
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,970
I hope that one day,

1081
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,470
when our Team ZGDX

1082
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,150
wins that trophy,

1083
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,930
I'll still be here,

1084
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,510
and you

1085
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:45,960
will still be here, too.

1086
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:50,750
Now,

1087
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:52,790
I,

1088
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:54,990
Yu Ming,

1089
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:58,120
member of Team ZGDX,

1090
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,040
will officially register for retirement

1091
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,280
after this spring season.

1092
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,110
Go, God Ming!

1093
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,960
Go, God Ming!

1094
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,530
God Ming, we will always support you.

1095
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,150
God Ming, we will always support you.

1096
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,230
Go, God Ming!

1097
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:42,510
Keep it up, God Ming!

1098
00:47:42,680 --> 00:48:01,520
God Ming! God Ming! God Ming!

1099
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:04,770
I want to join Team ZGDX.

1100
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:22,950
God Ming! God Ming! God Ming!

1101
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,950
[The ace mid laner of ZGDX]

1102
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,720
[God Ming]

1103
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,940
[True to the original purpose]

1104
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,290
[Dreams never die]

1105
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:25,940
-Excuse me.
-Look here.

1106
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,910
-I'm sorry. I won't sign it.
-Can I have your autograph?

1107
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,740
Please sign one for me too, God Yang.

1108
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,570
-Tong Yao!
-God Yang.

1109
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,030
Excuse me, let me through.

1110
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,540
I'll wait for you at the entrance.

1111
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,870
If anything comes up, remember to call me.

1112
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,050
I genuinely care about you.

1113
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,230
That's why I said those things to you earlier.

1114
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,450
Why did you join ZGDX?

1115
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,680
Who's that girl?

1116
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,190
Why is God Yang talking to her?

1117
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,290
She's not even that good-looking.

1118
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,160
Exactly.

1119
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,420
Who are you?

1120
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,350
Why is she so close to God Yang?

1121
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,080
Yeah, right?

1122
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,200
Let's go.

1123
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,400
Let go.

1124
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,310
Are you serious?

1125
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:07,870
You really signed with ZGDX?

1126
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,550
Yes, I did.

1127
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,960
It should have been officially announced by now.

1128
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,990
Weren't you strongly against me going pro before?

1129
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,160
Then why are you going pro yourself?

1130
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,120
Because I want to.

1131
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,980
It's none of your business.

1132
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,820
I wouldn't dare to control you.

1133
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,820
I'm just curious.

1134
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,570
Why didn't you tell me you were going pro?

1135
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,600
You should join our team.

1136
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,530
It's better than you going to ZGDX.

1137
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,740
Why should I tell you about my pro career?

1138
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,500
And why should I join your team?

1139
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,920
Because I'm on our team.

1140
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,370
I'll ask you again.

1141
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:29,450
Who are you?

1142
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,630
I taught you how to play the game.

1143
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,540
Even the client on your computer,

1144
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,430
was downloaded by me.

1145
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,560
If you want to go pro,

1146
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,190
you should join my team.

1147
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,910
Bro, how many times do I have to tell you?

1148
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,790
My pro career has nothing to do with you.

1149
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,870
You keep emphasizing that you taught me how to play.

1150
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,310
What? Do you want to charge me tuition?

1151
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:45,880
Tong Yao.

1152
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,730
You're deliberately trying to piss me off, aren't you?

1153
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,460
Jian Yang,

1154
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,710
just focus on your own pro career.

1155
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,710
Look at your first game,

1156
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,240
feeding in all three lanes.

1157
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,740
It was painful to watch.

1158
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,160
Wasn't it good?

1159
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,140
If you had told me earlier that you signed with them,

1160
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,460
I could have continued feeding in the second and third games.

1161
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,440
Consider it a gift to you.

1162
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,170
How nice to give your future team a championship.

1163
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:05,920
As for the championship,

1164
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,070
do we need you to give it to us?

1165
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,180
We have the ability to win it ourselves.

1166
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,940
Yao,

1167
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,450
can we talk seriously?

1168
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,950
Are you joining ZGDX to spite me?

1169
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,800
How many times do I have to say it?

1170
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,800
Going pro in esports is my own dream.

1171
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,120
It has absolutely nothing to do with you.

1172
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:22,940
Fine.

1173
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,320
If that's the case,

1174
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:25,790
when we meet on the battlefield,

1175
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,190
I won't show any mercy.

1176
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,250
Alright, see you on the battlefield.

1177
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,310
Cheng, why are you here?

1178
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,500
Enjoying the show.

1179
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,670
I just found out our team has a new member.

1180
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:58,760
You two know each other?

1181
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,780
You heard everything?

1182
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,990
You were arguing so loudly.

1183
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,250
It was hard not to hear.

1184
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,440
This is interesting.

1185
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,930
I was saying our team's new member

1186
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,190
is quite interesting.

1187
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,110
The fun of a competition

1188
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,010
lies in the fact that until the very last second,

1189
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:26,130
you never know what might happen.

1190
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,370
Life is the same.

1191
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,860
So,

1192
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,690
Tong Yao, whose name we just learned,

1193
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,510
are you ready to embrace it all?
