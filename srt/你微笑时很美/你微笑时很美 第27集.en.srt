What kind?

So strong that you have nothing to fear?

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm not.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,730
I also have fears,

hesitations,

Yeah.

I didn't.

Then who was the one crying so loud just now?

Do you think this room is well soundproofed?

Next time when you want to lie,

25
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,000
go cry under the covers.

I'm sure I wouldn't hear a thing even if you fainted.

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,010
it touched the water. That's why I cried.

Why is it bandaged up so ugly?

If there's a troublemaker in this world,

if you were mad at me

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,870

If that's the case,

113
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
at least I can dump you first.

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,780
That way, I won't be so embarrassed.

No.

According to ZGDX Esports Club,

153
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,360
the reason why Smiling has been absent from matches

154
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,930
is that she received a malicious package and her hand got cut.

155
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,750
ZGDX condemns this kind of behavior

156
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,680
and hopes that fans can restrain themselves

157

It's probably something I ate last night.

This?

169
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,130
This is because Cheng put pressure on the club.

Besides, the reason why we didn't response earlier

171

174
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,240
the public opinion will only get more out of control.

175
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,210
That's even worse.

176
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,680
Also,

177
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,330
this statement really worked.

178
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,080
We've found the person who sent you the package.

179
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,800
She's the one who posted

180
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,040
"How Schemer Tong Came Into Being."

181
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,400
Besides, some fans found that

182
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,240
she claimed on her alt account that she'd send you a knife.

183
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,960
My goodness. The fans are all denouncing her now.

184
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,620
Her Weibo is about to go viral.

185
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,680
Put this on your face.

186
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,400
You'll feel better.

187
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,660
Don't eat anything suspicious anymore.

188
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,520
Also,

189
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,570
be careful with PDA.

190
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,690
Lu Sicheng!

191
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,230
Are you stupid?

192
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,550
You went downstairs in pajamas again.

193
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,590
The one who posted "How Schemer Tong Came Into Being",

194
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,380
you posted such a slandering post and even sent a knife to Smiling.

195
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,040
What kind of grudge do you have against Smiling?

196
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,910
Shameless.

197
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,030
Why did you slander Smiling like that?

198
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,460
You even sent a knife to her.

199
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,870
Are you crazy?

200
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,420
Are you depressed in real life?

201
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,590
Posting slandering posts and sending knives.

202
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,400
Blogger, the prices of goods will definitely go up when your mom goes shopping.

203
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
You'll step in dog poop whenever you go out.

204
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
You'll forget to bring tissues whenever you go to the toilet.

205
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,760
Smiling's fans,

206
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,640
stop showing how low your IQs are, okay?

207
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,160
Doxing a private figure.

208
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,790
Aren't you ashamed at all?

209
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,740
Doxing a little girl.

210
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,850
You're really something, Schemer Tong.

211
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,860
Apologize to her immediately.

212
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,790
How ridiculous.

213
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,320
The victim hasn't said anything yet,

214
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
yet you guys started accusing the victim.

215
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,560
Do you have any conscience left?

216
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,470
Hello, everyone.

217
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm the unforgivable

218
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,840
"Momo is the Devil".

219
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,100
I'm the one who posted

220
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,390
"How Schemer Smiling Came Into Being."

221
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,340
I'm just an ordinary person,

222
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,730
an ordinary 9th grade student.

223
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,890
I was a loyal fan

224
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,170
who used to love Chessman from Team ZGDX,

225
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,420
and I'm also a patient with depression.

226
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,040
This is the diagnosis of major depressive disorder

227
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,520
I got from the First People's Hospital

228
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,220
in March this year.

229
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,770
Since then,

230
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,400
I've been taking medications,

231
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,780
and I was getting better.

232
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,270
But

233
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,860
your doxing behavior

234
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,110
has affected my life.

235
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,780
From the moment I was doxed,

236
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,270
I haven't slept for 48 hours.

237
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,510
I'm too tired,

238
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,030
too disappointed,

239
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,530
and too scared.

240
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,350
Let me end it like this.

241
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,470
Goodbye forever.

242
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,480
As you wish,

243
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,160
my depression has relapsed,

244
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,320
and I'm about to die because of you.

245
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,480
Smiling is so wicked.

246
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
As a public figure,

247
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,280
how could she indulge her fans

248
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,210
to dox and insult a private figure?

249
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,560
Why haven't you come forward to calm the waters?

250
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,840
Smiling and her lackeys.

251
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,760
It's best to have Smiling apologize in public.

252
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,120
ZGDX, please punish Smiling seriously.

253
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
I'm so confused.

254
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,640
How could this be the victim's fault?

255
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,770
Just because the perpetrator has depression?

256
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,190
What a moral manipulation.

257
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,290
I just clicked on the video and took a closer look

258
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,390
at the depression diagnosis of "Momo is the Devil."

259
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,350
I found that

260
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,050
it was diagnosed by the psychiatry department of our hospital.

261
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,250
But I don't recall we ever received her.

262
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,460
Can taking too many vitamins make you sick?

263
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,790
In fear.

264
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,020
The truth is not clear yet,

265
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,160
yet you're already condemning Smiling.

266
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,040
Smiling's lackey.

267
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,370
Get lost, accomplices.

268
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,900
From the moment I was doxed,

269
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,480
I haven't slept for 48 hours.

270
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,200
At this point,

271
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,060
this is no longer a small fight among esports fans,

272
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,010
but a public opinion event that has aroused public attention.

273
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,060
So we must treat it with caution

274
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,280
and come up with the best solution.

275
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,840
We can't bring more trouble

276
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,270
to Team ZGDX and the club.

277
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,550
Before the best plan is settled,

278
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,620
to avoid causing public outrage,

279
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,710
remove Tong Yao from

280
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
all recent activities of Team ZGDX.

281
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,220
How about this?

282
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,930
Ask Tong Yao to make a public apology first

283
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,360
to appease the negative comments online.

284
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,560
Although the whole thing

285
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,520
isn't directly related to Tong Yao,

286
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,350
this incident was still

287
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,360
more or less caused by her.

288
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,580
Caused by her?

289
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,710
First of all, the cause of this incident

290
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,790
wasn't Tong Yao,

291
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,840
but the girl

292
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,070
who sent the knife to Tong Yao.

293
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,010
Secondly,

294
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,880
the diagnosis of depression

295
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,750
that girl showed in the video

296
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,280
is questionable.

297
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,670
Her behavior in the video and the outcome of it are questionable.

298
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,510
When the whole thing is still unclear,

299
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,640
we can't ask Tong Yao to take the blame and make a public apology.

300
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,240
The problem is the public opinion is one-sided.

301
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
It's impossible to tell the truth.

302
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Is it?

303
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,200
If we want to know the truth,

304
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,410
we can call the police and get things straight.

305
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:40,920
Is this how you

306
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,780
protect the players of your club?

307
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,430
Making us take the blame whenever something goes wrong?

308
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,190
Is that so?

309
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,720
Lu Sicheng is right.

310
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,590
In fact, after "Momo is the Devil"

311
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,050
posted her suicide video,

312
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,980
some fans have contacted the local police.

313
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,280
They said they didn't receive any case

314
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,840
concerning a 9th grade student committing suicide.

315
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,300
So, whether this matter is true or not,

316
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,320
I still have my reservations.

317
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,000
This matter

318
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,630
is not as simple as it seems.

319
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,869
Lu Sicheng.

320
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,069
Although

321
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,740
Lu's is the largest shareholder,

322
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,359
you don't own the club.

323
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,520
You can do whatever you want normally.

324
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,440
But now,

325
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,400
I have to act in the collective interest of the club.

326
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,470
You can't punch above your weight.

327
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,839
The most important thing for us now is to swallow our pride

328
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,369
and assuage public opinion.

329
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,190
Aren't you worried

330
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,710
the players will be disappointed if you do this?

331
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,390
Enough.

332
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,610
End of discussion.

333
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,610
This is the club's decision.

334
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,760
Lu Sicheng.

335
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,230
Where are you going?

336
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,640
You higher-ups can disappoint the players of ZGDX,

337
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,480
but I can't.

338
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,940
Because I'm the captain.

339
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Since you won't be responsible,

340
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,360
I'll be responsible till the end.

341
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,910
Hello? I need you to do me a favor.

342
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,800
In the next regular match,

343
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920
we will face

344
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,720
our old rival, Team YQCB.

345
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
According to the system analysis of the last match

346
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,230
and this data comparison chart,

347
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,020
we can clearly see that

348
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,590
our comprehensive strength

349
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,740
is similar to that of the neighboring team.

350
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,430
In terms of attack and economy efficiency,

351
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,790
we have better performance.

352
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,670
But in vision and resource control,

353
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,660
Team YQCB is a little better than us.

354
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,290
Since the two teams are evenly matched,

355
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,470
we need to prepare for a long battle.

356
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,740
The hardest person to deal with in Team YQCB is Pope.

357
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,470
His game playing style has always been aggressive.

358
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,100
Cheng, be alert.

359
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,870
Make sure you pick a shikigami that has stable performance both in early and late stages

360
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,740
during ban and pick, like Komatsu.

361
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,230
This way, we can counter Poke

362
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,890
even if it'll be a long battle.

363
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,040
Hello? Go ahead.

364
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,660
Let's continue.

365
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,580
The subscriber you dialed can not be connected for the moment...

366
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,680
Have you got in touch with Cheng?

367
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,400
No.

368
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,260
Tong Yao also called him,

369
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,460
but he didn't answer.

370
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,560
The same thing happened

371
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,510
yesterday.

372
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,040
Do you think

373
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,990
Tong Yao's incident

374
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,030
affected Cheng?

375
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,980
It can't be.

376
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,710
I've worked with him for so many years.

377
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,710
He's not someone

378
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,140
who will delay training

379
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,810
and matches due to private matters.

380
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,690
If he leaves,

381
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,970
there must be a reason why he has to leave.

382
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,470
Both Tong Yao and I have told him

383
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,070
the time for training today.

384
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,880
I believe

385
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,990
he'll come back

386
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,230
when he should.

387
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,940
But the training is about to start.

388
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,540
What if he can't make it back?

389
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,310
How about this? I'll take his place for now.

390
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,060
I'll play Komatsu.

391
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,130
But God Ming, your hand...

392
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,880
It's okay.

393
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,300
The training is about to start.

394
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,990
Don't be so gloomy.

395
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,730
Let's go.

396
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,290
-Well...
-I'll play a game for Cheng.

397
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,840
So Cheng...

398
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,680
Cheng will definitely be back

399
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,010
for the match tomorrow.

400
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,920
Stop asking.

401
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,590
Come on.

402
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,470
Let's get ready to start.

403
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,240
Stop asking.

404
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,190
Sorry

405
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,760
for wasting your time.

406
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,750
We've been waiting for you.

407
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,460
Sit.

408
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,400
Cheng.

409
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,080
Your hand...

410
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,920
Don't worry. It's okay.

411
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,170
Alright.

412
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,750
Let's start.

413
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,880
Come on.

414
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,740
Now it's time for ban and pick.

415
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,570
Cheng, pick Komatsu.

416
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,850
Pang, pick Kusa.

417
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,160
Cat, pick Ibaraki Doji. K, pick Yasha.

418
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,230
Cat and K, you two flank.

419
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,480
Tong Yao, push lane.

420
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,340
Pang, come with me.

421
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,930
Okay.

422
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,780
Cat, K, push.

423
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,710
Pang, come with me.

424
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,490
Tong Yao, recall to get your HP up.

425
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,550
Cheng, be careful.

426
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,280
What?

427
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,670
What's going on?

428
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,740
It's okay. Let's continue.

429
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,460
We can't win this fight.

430
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,150
Let's focus on farming first.

431
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,610
Steady ourselves, and fight the next round.

432
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,870
Cheng, you're up so early.

433
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
What are you doing?

434
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,800
What am I doing?

435
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,450
I should be asking you that.

436
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,480
You stayed up all night again, didn't you?

437
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,940
You played rank all night?

438
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,800
The doctor said you can't overdo training.

439
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Do you not want your hand to recover?

440
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,070
I'm okay.

441
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,890
What about you?

442
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,930
Does your hand still hurt?

443
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,820
I'm alright.

444
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,620
Look.

445
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,070
It's almost healed.

446
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,450
How can you practice like this?

447
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,000
In the practice match yesterday,

448
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,630
I didn't play Komatsu well enough.

449
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,290
So I wanted to play more games to get a feel for it.

450
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,720
Finish this game for me.

451
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,640
I'll go upstairs and wash my face.

452
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,080
ZGDX versus YQCB.

453
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,080
Lu Sicheng versus Pope.

454
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,880
I'm really looking forward to it.

455
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,990
How much is the ticket?

456
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,970
Is half a month's salary enough?

457
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll bring a telescope.

458
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,360
I want a front row ticket.

459
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,110
Will it be Light's victory or Shadow's counterattack?

460
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,270
Place your bets.

461
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,590
I bet on Lu Sicheng.

462
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,270
Tickets for Light and Shadow Duel!

463
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,630
Take a look!

464
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,990
Don't grab.

465
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,290
Tickets for Light and Shadow Duel!

466
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,040
Don't grab.

467
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,320
There're more here.

468
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,610
Give me one! It's mine!

469
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,970
-Don't grab.
-Give me two more.

470
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Don't grab.

471
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,690
I want one! I want one!

472
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,890
I want to see it myself.

473
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,250
Everyone.

474
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,380
I bought you coffee with my own money.

475
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,460
Here, have some to refresh yourselves.

476
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,390
Do you want some?

477
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,190
Where are Cheng and God Ming?

478
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,920
Cheng just called God Ming out,

479
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,760
saying he had something to say to him.

480
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,410
They should be in the hallway.

481
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,520
They don't want coffee?

482
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,920
I'll bring it to them.

483
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,390
No reason.

484
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,310
It's just I don't want to use a shikigami for protracted fights.

485
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,390
Youko can counter Pope in the early stage.

486
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,040
If we prevent him from farming well,

487
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,700
we may be able to end the game as soon as possible.

488
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,550
Why?

489
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,630
Why do you want to end the game as soon as possible?

490
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,610
If I remember it correctly, I've analyzed it with you that

491
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,680
this will be a tough

492
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,060
-and protracted battle.
-What's wrong?

493
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,520
Give me an explanation.

494
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,920
There's no explanation.

495
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,300
I must defeat Pope.

496
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,520
Team ZGDX, please get ready

497
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,910
to go on stage.

498
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,100
Rui asked me to deliver coffee.

499
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,960
Let's go. Time to go on stage.

500
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,370
Let's go.

501
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,850
YQCB!

502
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,270
Dear audience.

503
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,980
Are you all ready?

504
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,480
YQCB!

505
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,200
The combination of Light and Shadow in the past

506
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,080
has finally come into unavoidable confrontation today.

507
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,090
Please bring us

508
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,690
the game of the century.

509
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,960
Dear audience.

510
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,710
Please put your glow sticks up

511
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,370
and cheer as loud as you can

512
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,670
to welcome them to the stage!

513
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,550
First, let's welcome Team YQCB.

514
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,460
Let's welcome Ai Jia,

515
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,930
Liang Sheng, Xbang,

516
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,980
Rong Rong, and Pope!

517
00:28:52,020 --> 00:29:05,810
Pope!

518
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,780
Since the day Pope

519
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,960
officially joined OPL,

520
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
we've been looking forward to this

521
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,030
during the entire league.

522
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,090
The day for the cross-group battle has finally arrived.

523
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,890
Will it be Light's victory

524
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,160
or Shadow's counterattack?

525
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,910
Let's stay tuned!

526
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,670
Today is just the day

527
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,680
Smiling returns to the professional arena, right?

528
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,800
Why are you so excited?

529
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,040
Don't you think you're a bit too dramatic?

530
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,840
Besides Smiling's return to the game,

531
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,500
aren't you looking forward to

532
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,360
the ultimate open duel between Chessman and Pope?

533
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,220
Let me tell you.

534
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,320
What's up?

535
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,030
Cheng, you...

536
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,120
Of course I'm looking forward to it.

537
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,240
To be honest...

538
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,060
Don't worry. I'm okay.

539
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Besides that,

540
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,520
the battle between the two teams' bottom lanes

541
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,920
is also very eye-catching.

542
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,390
That's right.

543
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,230
In the current patch where

544
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,280
the position of ADC is no longer as glorious as before

545
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,040
and seems unable to turn the tide,

546
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,360
now in OPL,

547
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,960
there are still two teams remaining

548
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,800
with ADC at their core.

549
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,230
Next, let's see

550
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,830
who'll be the final winner.

551
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,530
Let's welcome Cat,

552
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,160
K,

553
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,790
Pang,

554
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,890
Chessman,

555
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,560
and Smiling!

556
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,640
Now, both teams

557
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,190
are ready.

558
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,420
Next,

559
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,190
players of both teams,

560
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,710
please go back to your seats

561
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,030
and bring us an exciting game.

562
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,520
The atmosphere here at the venue

563
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,050
is really warm today.

564
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,140
It's like we're watching the finals in advance.

565
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,160
Dear fans at the venue,

566
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,690
you guys are so passionate.

567
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:14,880
Pope! Pope! Pope!

568
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,810
Check out Pope's fan base.

569
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,890
As expected from a man who's evenly matched with Cheng.

570
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,200
Come on.

571
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,480
The game will start soon.

572
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,740
Put on your earphones.

573
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,660
Now, it's time for

574
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,500
ban and pick.

575
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,510
Let's see which shikigami...

576
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,300
Ban Tesso.

577
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,120
Smiling from Team ZGDX will ban.

578
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,180
I asked Pope what he was going to play today,

579
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,950
and he said he would play Tesso.

580
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,840
Do you think he'd tell you the truth?

581
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,950
Can we believe what he says?

582
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,210
He must be lying to you.

583
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,270
Although it seems Pope

584
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,690
has been practicing that shikigami recently,

585
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,370
still...

586
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,210
Do as I say.

587
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,450
Ban Tesso.

588
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,770
Ban Tesso.

589
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,520
Tesso?

590
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,750
Smiling actually banned Tesso?

591
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,100
-Team ZGDX...
-What's going on?

592
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,600
-What did they learn?
-The look on Pope's face

593
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,480
is as complicated as it can be.

594
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,910
To put it simply,

595
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,360
it's two words,

596
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,640
"You liar."

597
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,950
What's going on?

598
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,440
Judging from their expressions,

599
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,930
it seems they did practice Tesso's tactics.

600
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,570
Cheng, I have to worry that

601
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,130
Pope will come and kill you.

602
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,790
All's fair in love and war.

603
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,790
Let him have Chin.

604
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,940
Ban Higanbana.

605
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,890
Higanbana is too strong in this patch.

606
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,220
I'll pick Susabi later.

607
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,420
I'm worried Tong Yao will counter me.

608
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:48,940
Okay.

609
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,680
As expected,

610
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,510
Team ZGDX banned Susabi

611
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,380
and Ubume.

612
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,900
And Team YQCB

613
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,800
banned the shikigami K's famous for, Mannendake,

614
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,440
as well as Smiling's Tamamonomae.

615
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,640
I wonder if

616
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,530
Smiling will pick Ootengu again.

617
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,430
Cat, pick Ootengu for Smiling.

618
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,110
Okay.

619
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,070
As expected,

620
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,860
Team ZGDX picked Ootengu,

621
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,050
while Team YQCB picked Chin and Yamausagi.

622
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,730
And then, Team ZGDX

623
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,580
picked Yasha for jungle,

624
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,440
and Ibaraki Doji for top lane,

625
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,140
while Team YQCB picked

626
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,100
Menreiki and Yoto Hime.

627
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,710
Now, Chessman is the only one who hasn't picked.

628
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,570
-Cheng.
-Logically,

629
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,250
in the face of YQCB's lineup,

630
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,760
Cheng should pick Komatsu, right?

631
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,440
Yes.

632
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,660
Komatsu

633
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,380
is a relatively safe choice.

634
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,480
What?

635
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,910
Youko?

636
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,260
Chessman picked Youko again!

637
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,530
Gosh, this is another

638
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,210
unexpected pick.

639
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,520
I hope Chessman

640
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,870
can win the upper hand in the early stage

641
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,870
and end the game fast in today's game just like before.

642
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,910
The game's started.

643
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,110
Go, go, go.

644
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,560
Hello, dear audience.

645
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,159
This is the last game day

646
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,230
of the fifth week

647
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,429
of OPL China division.

648
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,580
Today,

649
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,300
we'll witness the first cross-group battle of BO3

650
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,380
between Team ZGDX and Team YQCB.

651
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,560
Will the usual powerhouse, Team ZGDX,

652
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,429
end YQCB's journey to victory,

653
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,790
or will the dark horse of the national games,

654
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,080
the rising phoenix, Team YQCB,

655
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,820
end Team ZGDX's journey to godhood?

656
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,920
Let's stay tuned!

657
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,550
Cat, come to top lane.

658
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,170
Okay.

659
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,420
Cheng, we've pushing the minion wave too deep. It's not safe.

660
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,350
K, come to bottom lane to camp them.

661
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,280
We should retreat.

662
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,949
Their jungler, Yoto Hime, is about to come to the bottom lane.

663
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,389
Pang, go scout.

664
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,420
Chessman is pushing our tower quite aggressively.

665
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,670
He wouldn't leave even after clearing the minion wave.

666
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,160
The reason he picked Youko was to fight me in the early stage

667
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,430
and suppress the farming of Chin.

668
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,580
Since they're pushing so aggressively,

669
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,220
okay,

670
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,220
Xbang, camp them.

671
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,590
Ai Jia, stay on mid lane.

672
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,830
Be careful. Their jungler must be there too.

673
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,120
K has also come to bottom lane.

674
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,160
Will he camp Pope successfully?

675
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,550
My goodness. Pope wouldn't leave the tower at all.

676
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,490
Xbang's Yoto Hime

677
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,430
has also been wandering around bottom lane.

678
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,620
We can't get any advantage at all.

679
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,580
Let's retreat. They have advantage in HP.

680
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,680
Wait for our mid laner to farm,

681
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,840
and we can come to bottom lane together then.

682
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,280
They don't have any advantage on mid lane and bottom lane now.

683
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,000
It'll be hard for ZGDX to win this game.

684
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,360
Besides, on mid lane right now,

685
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,900
Ai Jia's Menreiki is farming steadily.

686
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,760
Smiling can't get any advantage.

687
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,240
Obviously, Ai Jia is as stable as a rock.

688
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,560
trying to make our mid laner die a slow death.

689
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,890
He's not as stable as a rock, okay?

690
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,250
He's just cunning.

691
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,690
I can't support you now.

692
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,540
It's okay. We've evacuated safely.

693
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,000
Be careful on bottom lane.

694
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,280
Rong Rong's Aobozu

695
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,350
is also hard to deal with.

696
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,150
I'm personally

697
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,150
marked by Ai Jia today.

698
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,040
He's clinging to me in this game

699
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,300
like he does to Jinyang in real life.

700
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,750
I couldn't find any chance.

701
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,750
My skills are ready. Let's counterattack.

702
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,210
Pang's Kusa has his control skill ready.

703
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,090
Be careful.

704
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,790
-Okay.
-It's only been a few minutes.

705
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,900
What levels are you guys at?

706
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,480
Don't push them too hard on bottom lane.

707
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,170
Cheng.

708
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,010
We can fight.

709
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,040
-Light and Shadow are confronting each other on bottom lane.
-Don't rush.

710
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,480
Back off a little.

711
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,640
Clean up!

712
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,560
Will Pope be able to escape?

713
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,120
He succeeded!

714
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,400
Pang, control Pope.

715
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,840
Okay.

716
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,750
YQCB almost fed two kills.

717
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,310
Not bad, Cheng. Nice.

718
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,940
Captain, well done.

719
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,750
Nice counterattack.

720
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,160
Pope suffered a loss in this round.

721
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,760
Cheng earned 260.

722
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,960
I think you should keep a low profile.

723
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,840
Lay low.

724
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,250
What a pity.

725
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,380
Youko and Kusa are also low in HP.

726
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,030
My support won't die in vain.

727
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,810
What? Pope didn't recall to get his HP up!

728
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,110
He made a tower dive, ganked

729
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,030
and cleaned up Youko and Kusa who were both in low HP.

730
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,060
Nice, Pope! Awesome.

731
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,160
Pope's tower dive

732
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,640
instantly turned the number difference from 1 to 0

733
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,750
to 2 to 2.

734
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,300
The economies of both teams have returned to similar levels.

735
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,870
It seems the final winner of this game

736
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,090
is still far from certain.

737
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,800
Tower dive?

738
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,960
Was that necessary?

739
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,220
I guess Pope couldn't stand

740
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,460
letting Cheng go since he saw Cheng was in low HP.

741
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,310
Pope was so brave in that blink and head trade.

742
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,590
If I were him, I would have backed down.

743
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,970
That's the kind of person you are.

744
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,090
As we can see,

745
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,960
Chessman is still pushing bottom lane.

746
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,600
We should retreat.

747
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,930
I think Xbang is coming.

748
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,020
Let's go.

749
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,430
-Oh my god.
-Yeah.

750
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,940
Xbang started to attack.

751
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,940
Pang blocked it.

752
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,230
Both of them started to retreat.

753
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,490
Can they escape alive?

754
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,350
Can they?

755
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,630
-That was so close.
-He scared the hell out of me.

756
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,440
Xbang's flanking is so underhanded.

757
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,370
Cheng, you really need to recall and get your HP up.

758
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,040
Pushing the lane like this.

759
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,470
My heart can't take it anymore.

760
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,020
Cheng's Youko

761
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,710
should have recalled to recuperate, right?

762
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,520
The minion wave is coming.

763
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,030
Chessman will definitely go earn the experience

764
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,040
and try to destroy the tower when I'm not around.

765
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,080
Xbang, don't leave.

766
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
Keep camping him.

767
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,680
The minion wave is coming.

768
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,810
Let's clean up the minion wave before we leave.

769
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,720
We can't do that. Xbang is still here.

770
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,280
Pope will also be back soon after he recuperates.

771
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,150
They've started a fight on bottom lane.

772
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,080
Xbang is still here.

773
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,730
Pope and Liang Sheng's HPs are both very healthy.

774
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,790
Be careful, Cheng!

775
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,030
Xbang is on bottom lane.

776
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,990
K, come to top lane.

777
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,090
Let's push the top lane tower.

778
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,150
Don't be greedy. There's not enough time.

779
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,350
Whatever. I'll do it.

780
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,490
Luckily, they escaped fast.

781
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,370
Yeah.

782
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:00,760
Let's see top lane.

783
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,040
K is on his way to top lane.

784
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,080
Cat attacked alone first

785
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,640
and was damaged to low HP.

786
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,470
K has arrived.

787
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,760
Can he save Cat?

788
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,190
Cat was killed.

789
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,530
K didn't let go of Rong Rong, who was low in HP.

790
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,300
Tower dive!

791
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,240
Unfortunately, he failed to escape.

792
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,310
I told you to come earlier,

793
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,250
yet you insisted on staying on bottom lane

794
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,820
and camping that Pope.

795
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,750
If I didn't block bottom lane,

796
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,060
would you deal damage later?

797
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,790
This trade of two for one was really a loss to them.

798
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,200
To be honest,

799
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,520
Team ZGDX's situation is not optimistic.

800
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,110
The game has been going on for 11 minutes.

801
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,570
The economy gap between the two teams is 1,300 yuan.

802
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,610
-Team YQCB is in the lead for now.
-Yeah.

803
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,600
Did you see that?

804
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,140
For Team ZGDX,

805
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,990
its top lane and bottom lane

806
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,400
are having a really hard time right now.

807
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,240
Look, Pope

808
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,230
has been keeping Chessman on bottom lane

809
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,530
-and wouldn't give him a chance to fight.
-Yeah.

810
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,440
He could neither get rid of him nor leave.

811
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,210
Now, it's safe to say that

812
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,440
in Team ZGDX,

813
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,110
the only player

814
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,240
who's farming normally is Smiling,

815
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,250
who's been laning against Ai Jia.

816
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,920
-Yes.
-We can only count on her now.

817
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,460
Hopefully, she will turn the tide by herself.

818
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,920
Come on, let's destroy it.

819
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,380
Hurry up.

820
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,000
Cheng, they're pushing the Octopus.

821
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,840
Let's give up Octopus.

822
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,040
Go destroy the mid lane tower.

823
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,830
I'll try.

824
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,450
Be careful. Liang Sheng's Yamausagi has speed boost,

825
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,910
and Pope is following him.

826
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,470
It won't do. Pope is too fast in cleaning up the minion wave.

827
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,380
I can't destroy the tower. I'll go back to our tower.

828
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,680
Drag it a bit longer and destroy the tower.

829
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,600
It's not that hard.

830
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,560
I'll flank.

831
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,180
Be careful not to be separated by them.

832
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,280
Ai Jia has no ultimate.

833
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
Cat, hold the tower. I'll kill them.

834
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,670
They've engaged!

835
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,300
Retreat. Retreat.

836
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,960
Ai Jia has been killed.

837
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,830
Three seconds till my ultimate.

838
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,360
Their jungler hasn't shown up till now.

839
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,670
Aim your ultimate at my position.

840
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,590
My skills are all ready, too.

841
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,140
Xbang rushed out,

842
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,370
trying to kill the squishies,

843
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,720
but unexpectedly, he got controlled by Pang

844
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,280
and was killed by Smiling's skills.

845
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,520
Retreat. Retreat.

846
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,990
The current situation is very unfavorable for Team YQCB.

847
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,560
I don't think they can hold the tower anymore.

848
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,270
They'll definitely give it up.

849
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,200
We can't let them recall.

850
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,880
Cat, push the tower.

851
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,720
Yes, keep going.

852
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,730
Cat rushed over.

853
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,120
Look, Liang Sheng got killed.

854
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,250
The only one alive on Team YQCB now is Pope.

855
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,200
Team kill! Team YQCB got wiped out!

856
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,240
YQCB suffered a great loss in this team fight.

857
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,850
They got killed, and they lost the first tower on mid lane.

858
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,180
Xbang also made a mistake in positioning.

859
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,370
Team ZGDX got a head trade of 0 to 5.

860
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,760
But I don't think

861
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,840
this will happen again.

862
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,310
Team YQCB will learn their lesson

863
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,790
and protect their damage dealer.

864
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,050
As for Team ZGDX,

865
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,880
it won't be that easy

866
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,840
to kill the other team's core player again.

867
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,640
Yeah. I also hope Team ZGDX

868
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,040
can seize this opportunity.

869
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,840
I finally destroyed the mid lane tower Ai Jia was guarding.

870
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,170
Captain, let's go push.

871
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,490
Where are you going?

872
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,010
Chessman is retreating?

873
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,640
-Why did he choose to retreat
-Cheng?

874
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,400
when they have the biggest advantage?

875
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,080
We can't push Orochi now, can we?

876
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,610
What is Chessman thinking?

877
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,080
They seem to have left.

878
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:26,850
No way.

879
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,280
Since Chessman gave up this tower,

880
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,350
he must have gone to push Orochi.

881
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,250
Everyone, go to Orochi's pit after you respawn.

882
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,300
What, Cheng?

883
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,070
It's too dangerous to push Orochi now.

884
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,310
If they don't keep pushing,

885
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,310
they won't have enough time to destroy Orochi!

886
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,540
They've respawned.

887
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,420
Let's retreat.

888
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,090
Let's retreat, Cheng. We won't be able to destroy it.

889
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,300
Cheng, let's go.

890
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,250
How can we fight like this?

891
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,430
Cheng, they're here.

892
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,160
We can fight.

893
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,170
Smiling, engage with your ultimate.

894
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,140
I'll stall Pope.

895
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,400
Team YQCB has respawned!

896
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,860
-Is Team ZGDX still not retreating?
-Fight!

897
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,140
Cheng?

898
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,260
Cheng actually missed.

899
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,180
That was really a historical moment.

900
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,640
Cheng, I can't hold on any longer.

901
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,770
What should we do?

902
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,770
Go for team fight. My ultimate is ready.

903
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,830
Let's go. Let's go.

904
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,520
Let's go. Let's go.

905
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,340
I'm dead.

906
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,350
What a pity.

907
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,360
Chessman was so close.

908
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,330
If he had killed Pope with that ultimate just now,

909
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,460
the result would have been hard to say.

910
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,800
Obviously,

911
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,560
Chessman made a mistake in command.

912
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,870
Yes. How could he have asked their mid laner to engage?

913
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,750
Think about it. How long could a mid laner possibly last?

914
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,220
Where was the tank? How could they fight like that?

915
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,220
Exactly.

916
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,080
Great!

917
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,000
Nice! Nice.

918
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,880
Let's congratulate Team YQCB

919
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,710
on winning the game.

920
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,760
Congratulations to Team YQCB!

921
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,610
Cat!

922
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,550
Cheng, your hand...

923
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,070
It's okay.

924
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,460
Let's go.
