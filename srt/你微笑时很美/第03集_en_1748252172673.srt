1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
No one can be attracted to the internet.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm used to it.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,600
Why didn't you tell me about your career?

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,600
You came to our team,

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,800
so you don't have to be a ZZDX, okay?

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
Brother,

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm willing to be in charge of my career.

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,600
I have nothing to do with you.

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,400
I can't take it anymore.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,600
Brother Zhan,

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,600
is this your girlfriend?

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,800
Especially in my case.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,800
Snorri?

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,600
It must be.

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
Although I'm only a backup,

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,200
it looks like a cute girl.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Do you know Jian Yao?

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I've only been here a few days,

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,400
so I've been with Brother Cheng.

20
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,000
Snorri,

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,600
we all have something to look forward to.

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,200
It's your first time to be in a blind date.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,400
Democracy

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 2

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
defeated

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,800
Jaundice

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Miss,

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,000
are you getting yourENSMEimmtÃ© double card?

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm interested.

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Try it!

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
The fire is ready.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
It's sealed.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Xiao Yi, you're good at this.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Don't run away.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Wait a moment.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I'll fight them.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Why is the opponent here?

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
He's so strong.

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Miss, stop hiding. I can't keep my hands on you.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Just take a step back. I'll be right back.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Stop it. There are three people over there.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
It's okay. Just hit them.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Just jump on them.

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I...

46
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I'll jump on you.

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
I...

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Fatty, you're so mean.

49
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Nice.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
You're so fast.

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Come on, Fatty. One more time.

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
One more time. One more time.

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Come on. Protect him.

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Run.

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
One.

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Six.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Six.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Miss, what kind of weirdo are you?

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
I feel like I've played a fake game.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Are you sure we're playing double?

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
How can I feel like a orphan?

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Fatty, you're a support.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
You're going to get hurt.

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
How can I be a coward?

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Miss, I didn't realize

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
that you're playing games with someone completely different.

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
No wonder someone called you a power-up.

68
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Miss, you got an MVP.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
You're so good.

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Relax. Let's fly together.

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Okay.

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
K, our new middle class Miss.

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
You're so good.

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
You got the whole team's money and the head of the crowd.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
You're so good.

76
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
You're a good player.

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Why do you care about others' death?

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
It's okay.

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
It's okay.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
You played really well.

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Really.

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Let's go. Let's go.

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Okay.

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I'll play the third.

85
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
I won't play the third.

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You won't play the third?

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I know you're going to be a replacement.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Although K is wrong,

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
it doesn't make sense to say that.

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I understand.

91
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
He's too reckless.

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
He doesn't have any consciousness.

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
He lacks professional speed.

94
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
I know.

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
When we were testing,

96
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
you told me that.

97
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Are you okay?

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I told you to come for you.

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Why are you so quiet?

100
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
It's okay.

101
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
How do you feel?

102
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm not in a team.

103
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I lack professional speed.

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Professional speed can be cultivated.

105
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
He's the best among all of us.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Why do we have to find a new person?

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
We've discussed this issue.

108
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
You're our middle class.

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
You're the best.

110
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
You're the best.

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
You've discussed this issue.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
You're our middle class.

113
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
You're the best.

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
You're the best.

115
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
You're the best.

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
You've never asked me.

117
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Why did you choose Tong Yao?

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Half of our team

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
is from your eyes.

120
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Moreover,

121
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
she's your middle class.

122
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I believe in your judgment.

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
She's the one

124
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I picked out from hundreds of people.

125
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Her victory is very strong.

126
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
She doesn't easily admit defeat.

127
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
She's not afraid of the sky or the earth.

128
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
She's a little like you.

129
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
I can't play anymore.

130
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
But I didn't choose to retire

131
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
because of my injury.

132
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Many new people

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
came out of the Spring Festival this year.

134
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
If we want to enter the finals,

135
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
we need to have a new training like Tong Yao.

136
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
You're so handsome.

137
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
There's a risk.

138
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
The national team is about to start.

139
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
So I need you

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
to train Tong Yao with me.

141
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
You're right.

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
She must learn

143
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
to be a professional player.

144
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
She's not a player.

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm not a player.

146
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I'm not a player.

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
You should

148
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
make a plan for her.

149
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Let's start from tomorrow.

150
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Okay.

151
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Hello.

152
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Son,

153
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
do you know how much your mom is upset?

154
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I just said a few words.

155
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Your mom is out of the team again.

156
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
I got it.

157
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
I'll go home tomorrow.

158
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
No, son.

159
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
You need to think of a way.

160
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
How can I help you?

161
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
It's okay.

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
You should go home.

163
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Don't worry.

164
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I'll train her tomorrow.

165
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Tong Yao,

166
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
we're starting to train.

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
What I'm going to talk about today

168
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
is a professional player.

169
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
It's not the purpose of the final game

170
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
to get her personal victory,

171
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
but the team's victory.

172
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
In this process,

173
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
you need to be very patient

174
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
and have a lot of personal experience.

175
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
First, you need to be

176
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
the mastermind of the team.

177
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Okay.

178
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm ready to be a professional player.

179
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Okay, let's start.

180
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Look at this.

181
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Train the speed, train the arm,

182
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
understand the background and the characteristics of the teacher.

183
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
The character?

184
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
These are too basic.

185
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Did you get it wrong?

186
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
You're a newbie to professional computers.

187
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
You need to know that

188
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
playing games with computers

189
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
is like playing a game.

190
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
So you need to train hard.

191
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Let's start.

192
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Keep playing.

193
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
One more time.

194
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I'm so tired.

195
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm being trained.

196
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Hello?

197
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Hello, Yao Yao.

198
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
You got up so early?

199
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I didn't get up.

200
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I haven't slept yet.

201
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm tired.

202
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I sent you a picture.

203
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Look, look at it.

204
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,300
XU Kai Shui,

205
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,960
well,

206
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,600
you have your problem.

207
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Why?

208
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
No one knows you.

209
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,440
Let go.

210
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,540
I didn't QIUQI.

211
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,940
It's amazing,

212
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,100
when he said that

213
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,600
we were so close to each other.

214
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
What happened to him then?

215
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Just now,

216
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
it was just a dream

217
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,640
It's too hard.

218
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,200
I was trained as a dog.

219
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,280
I train 12 hours a day

220
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,440
and I still have basic operations.

221
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,760
My hands are almost gone.

222
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,360
I suspect they're really against me.

223
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,200
Oh no.

224
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
What's wrong?

225
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,640
I have a mistake

226
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,680
that I'm talking to my family.

227
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,960
Goodbye.

228
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,800
The End

229
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,960
Who is it?

230
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,880
Miss,

231
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,080
are you up?

232
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,200
Have you eaten?

233
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,760
I just fell asleep.

234
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,560
I'm not eating.

235
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,160
It's dark.

236
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,480
The god of the name called you

237
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
to give me a pair of shoes.

238
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,080
Do you want a pair?

239
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,360
Oh.

240
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,240
Ke.

241
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,640
Yes, Ke.

242
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,120
Coming.

243
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,720
Let's go.

244
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,520
I'll be there soon.

245
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,320
The god of the name called you?

246
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,800
I'm done.

247
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,320
Oh no.

248
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:05,880
What's wrong?

249
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,880
Who came by?

250
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
This sunflower?

251
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Why is this name so familiar?

252
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Yang Yang, what a coincidence.

253
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Play it well later. I'll call you.

254
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
God of Yang.

255
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
My goodness.

256
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Lui Chengkou.

257
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
No, right?

258
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
What's wrong again?

259
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I've sent Chengkou.

260
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Why didn't I go to buy the lottery ticket today?

261
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Chengkou and Jian Yang.

262
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
What position does Chengkou have?

263
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
He's also good at playing the game.

264
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
That's it.

265
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
He's probably going to help you with the mid-way.

266
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
What should I do?

267
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,880
I almost got to the capital.

268
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Why did I meet Chengkou?

269
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm convinced.

270
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
And there's a Jian Yang.

271
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Don't be ridiculous.

272
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Chengkou chose this god of the world.

273
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
He's a god of the mid-term.

274
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
As long as God of Yang comes to the mid-way,

275
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
he can still play the game for a minute.

276
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Don't panic. I'll teach you a lesson.

277
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,880
You can just let me play for a while.

278
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
Fine.

279
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Or you'll just hang up.

280
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Listen to me.

281
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Chengkou will definitely win.

282
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
You're going to say it now?

283
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Listen to me.

284
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
That's right.

285
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Chengkou.

286
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I still have one more god of the mid-term.

287
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,880
So, please don't mess with me.

288
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
I'm going to kneel for you.

289
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I think I really have one.

290
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Chengkou is down.

291
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Of course.

292
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
You're so suspicious.

293
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
It's OK.

294
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
What are you doing?

295
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Let me hug you.

I'm sorry, Brother Cheng.

322
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,060
It's all because of Xiao Pang.

323
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,860
Your son is very good.

324
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,660
He's a good son.

325
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Hello, good boy.

326
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,700
Brother Cheng,

327
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,700
we miss you so much.

328
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,700
When will you come back?

329
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,500
It seems that we miss you so much.

330
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,300
Don't come to Zhonglu

331
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,700
to see the scenery of the next road.

332
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
What is it?

333
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,500
They don't care about you.

334
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,300
They say it's interesting.

335
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,700
It's interesting to talk about it yourself.

336
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,700
What is it?

337
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,700
What is it?

338
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,500
What?

339
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,500
I'll just call them.

340
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,700
Tong Yao,

341
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,500
you want this, right?

342
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,100
Hello.

343
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,300
Didn't I tell you not to call?

344
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,300
Old K.

345
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
Miss, don't worry.

346
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,700
I guess Old K called the family.

347
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,300
He just called the family.

348
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,100
That's all.

349
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,900
Not you.

350
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,700
Why don't you call?

351
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,500
I'll call back tomorrow.

352
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Watch your cat.

353
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,100
Good bye.

354
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,900
Who? What's wrong?

355
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,300
Brother Cheng.

356
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,900
Brother Cheng? What did he say?

357
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
He said he would come back tomorrow.

358
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
No, you can go later.

359
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:07,900
What?

360
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,900
Look, the ë§ìëï¿½arian general's entrance.

Super Gill.

367
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,840
This is the sham.

368
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,340
Look what I am saying.

369
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,100
Such a cheap words?

370
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,140
Everything in this world needs UCLA now.

371
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,560
Are you sure?

372
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,640
Everybody has their own matters here.

373
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,240
That's good.

374
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,400
If we break up,

375
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,920
how can we play the game together?

376
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
What's all this?

377
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Is it about Yao Yao?

378
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,120
Didn't she play the game?

379
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,600
Why did she even date?

380
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,600
Who is this?

381
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,240
It's so hard to hear.

382
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,840
No.

383
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,280
Hello?

384
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,880
Hello, mom.

385
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,440
Yao Yao.

386
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,280
Explain to us.

387
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,600
What's going on?

388
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,640
Why did you come out of the car?

389
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,000
Are you going to play the game

390
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,880
or to date?

391
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,400
Mom.

392
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,440
I've said it eight hundred times.

393
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,680
What else can I say?

394
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,600
There's nothing.

395
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,440
I've been here for a few days.

396
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
How could I date?

397
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,640
And we practice for 12 hours every day.

398
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,440
I have to have some space to date.

399
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,880
Well,

400
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,480
Jing Jing.

401
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm not sure.

402
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm not sure.

403
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,200
What's the name of the Jing Quan Yang's factory?

404
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,840
What do you mean by Jing Quan Yang's factory?

405
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
I don't know what people on it say.

406
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,800
I want to ask them

407
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,840
why they understand it so much.

408
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,080
Let me ask you.

409
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,280
Is God Yang Jian Yang?

410
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,520
He broke up with you last year.

411
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,040
He used to live next door.

412
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,560
Yes.

413
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,160
God Yang Jian Yang.

414
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,720
Yes.

415
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,320
He lives next door.

416
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,560
When we were in a relationship,

417
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,280
you didn't take me to college.

418
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,560
Why did you do that?

419
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,520
I met him when we were competing.

420
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I didn't meet him.

421
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,720
Who was Brother Cheng?

422
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,840
Did he seduce you?

423
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,880
Brother Cheng is our captain.

424
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,080
He's innocent.

425
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,120
Don't say that.

426
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,360
What did he seduce me?

427
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,800
I have that ability.

428
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,720
No.

429
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm telling you.

430
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,320
You're a little girl.

431
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,280
You're a little girl.

432
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,400
You need to be more careful.

433
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,440
Don't do anything random.

434
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,840
Let the internet guy catch the hook.

435
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,960
It's not good to win a blind date.

436
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,360
Mom, I'm hanging up.

437
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,680
Yao Yao.

438
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,280
Brother Cheng.

439
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,440
What are you doing?

440
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,520
Why are you back so early?

441
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,600
Kid.

442
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,760
What's the matter with

443
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,800
Jian Yang in CK?

444
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,520
What's the matter?

445
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,360
We met at the pool yesterday.

446
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,200
Someone put it on the gym.

447
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,080
It's all a secret.

448
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,920
Don't tell me you didn't see it.

449
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,000
I did.

450
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,880
Why do you watch the gym?

451
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,680
It's thousands of floors back.

452
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,360
The relationship between us

453
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,920
is connected.

454
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,800
The specific content.

455
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,280
The female lead of the new day.

456
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,960
The man who can't find a man.

457
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,680
The man who can't cool down.

458
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Come on.

459
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,680
Come on.

460
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Of course I know him.

461
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,400
I knew him a long time ago.

462
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Yang.

463
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,560
Don't be unhappy.

464
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,840
Have some yogurt.

465
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Oh, no.

466
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,600
Yang is scolding people.

467
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
I'm sorry.

468
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I'm sorry.

469
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I'm sorry.

470
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm sorry.

471
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
I'm sorry.

472
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm sorry.

473
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
I'm sorry.

474
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
I'm sorry.

476
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
I'm sorry.

477
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm sorry.

479
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
I'm sorry.

480
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,880
Yang is scolding people.

481
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,040
Oh, no.

482
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
It's raining.

483
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,640
What should we do?

484
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Go.

485
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Go.

486
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
I...

487
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Yang.

488
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,720
What's the matter with that smiley?

489
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
You really want to know?

490
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
There's a ex-girlfriend.

491
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
She came to work.

492
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
It's all because of me.

493
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,760
Come on. This way.

494
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
It's too much.

495
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Come on.

496
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I can't beat her.

497
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Come on.

498
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,920
Right.

499
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Hit her.

500
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Go.

501
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Go.

502
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Hit her.

503
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
I can't beat her.

504
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Come on.

505
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Come on.

506
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Come on.

507
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm sorry.

508
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yang.

511
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,400
Are you happy?

512
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Or do you want to teach me?

513
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
I'll play with you.

514
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Okay.

515
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Sit.

516
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Which one should I choose?

517
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Which one is better?

518
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Don't mess with me.

519
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Choose this one.

520
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
White hair, long hair, and this one.

521
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
It's her.

522
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
It's so ugly.

523
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
You can choose the one you want.

524
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Is there any type of one

525
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
that doesn't need to run around

526
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
and can blow up the house?

527
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
It's pretty and it's easy to see.

528
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
It doesn't have to be a line with others.

529
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
It's not like the one

530
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
that's sold by others

531
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
when it's not picked up.

532
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
There is.

533
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
The middle one.

534
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Choose the one with the early morning.

535
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
You're very young!

536
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
Change your clothes.

537
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Is there anything wrong with today?

538
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Come on, cook.

539
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
Okay.

540
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,240
Right, in the meantime...

541
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Hm?

542
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
You want to eat ice cream

543
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
or add nailako ã­

544
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
An Ice Cream?

545
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
Ice Cream at the end.

546
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,800
Help! Help!

547
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,920
I'm dead again. Why am I dead again?

548
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,600
Jian Yang,

549
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,080
there's no girlfriend in the middle of the road.

550
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,240
Coming. Coming. Coming.

551
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,840
I'll kill you if anyone dares to touch you.

552
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,160
Gosh.

553
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,280
Where was she afterwards?

554
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,160
She was...

555
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,240
My girlfriend is here lately.

556
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Jian Yang.

557
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,240
Thank you.

558
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Thank you.

559
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,800
Open it.

560
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,520
How is it? Do you like it?

561
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,160
I like it. You like everything I give you.

562
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,400
I know. I'll help you wear it.

563
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,640
Look, is it nice?

564
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,680
Hurry and wear it.

565
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
You want me to go out?

566
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,520
It's snowing. Don't you want to write it?

567
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,960
Don't just stand there and beg me to write it for you.

568
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,880
What's wrong?

569
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,520
I won't go to school.

570
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,360
What?

571
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,680
A professional team manager has looked at me.

572
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,480
He's going to Shenzhen to get a training. If it goes well,

573
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,680
I'll stay at the big competition.

574
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,880
My parents have agreed.

575
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,920
You know I'm not good at learning.

576
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
I don't know what to do after graduation.

577
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,400
I like this profession. I think I can go even further in this aspect.

578
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,280
I don't understand.

579
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:43,520
I don't know where the wind comes from.

580
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,240
Later, he joined the professional team.

581
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,800
He had teammates, fans, and bright future.

582
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,680
At that time, I was thinking,

583
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,800
is there still my position around him?

584
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,160
At first, I thought there was.

585
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,000
I talked to him in a hurry every day.

586
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,760
I'm talking about winning a competition today. How many fans like him?

587
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,040
Seeing his post-it photo,

588
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,760
it's like I witnessed the glory with him.

589
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,080
I didn't understand it.

590
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,720
Even if we were supporting him, we couldn't go back to the past.

591
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
Yang Yang, did you see my performance today?

592
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,640
I was good. Did you see my third round?

593
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
It was just a meaningless night.

594
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,960
I saw everyone praising me.

595
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,080
Yes. They were asking where this Yang Cun came from.

596
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,000
He was really good.

597
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,720
He's going to be a representative tonight.

598
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,760
Don't be so desperate.

599
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,200
The most suspicious person.

600
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,680
Come on, go up.

601
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,640
I'm going to go up.

602
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,960
You can hit him.

603
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,760
Go up.

604
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,640
I didn't understand.

605
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,640
I didn't understand the wind coming from somewhere.

606
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
What are you doing?

607
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,640
You're in my arms.

608
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,640
My heart is with this pain.

609
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,640
My heart is always broken.

610
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Are you ready to sleep?

611
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm tired.

612
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,040
Qian Ying.

613
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,540
Let's meet face to face when we die.

614
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,740
Bad boys.

615
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,620
Not only past development but also future.

616
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,940
What can we destroy?

617
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,180
What, what should we destroy?

618
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,560
How about now?

619
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,260
Then,

620
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,560
he has really become a famous star.

621
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,400
Then

622
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,120
he will never answer my mobile number or Wechat with me.

623
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,040
Then

624
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,960
we will break up, human beings will be eitherrsv.

625
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
and free.

626
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,360
So the small things in the chicken and horse are going to be enlarged.

627
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,960
It's normal to break up.

628
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,560
Captain, you have a life.

629
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,160
How dare you do this?

630
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,760
Who doesn't have a life?

631
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Yang Shan, you are just a small peasant.

632
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,160
Look,

633
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,960
you train him to be the first in the national service.

634
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Then break up with him.

635
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,160
You strengthen a wave of hatred.

636
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,960
Then let him join the enemy team.

637
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,160
Let him become the biggest soft-blooded rhythm for you.

638
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,960
What kind of bitter drama is this?

639
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
This is too much.

640
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,160
Yang Shan is too old.

641
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,760
No.

642
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,560
Yang Shan, what kind of grudge does our team have with you?

643
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,960
Why are you so against us?

644
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,160
Are you sure, Yang Shan?

645
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,760
You are so stubborn.

646
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,160
Don't be scared.

647
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
I haven't finished my story yet.

648
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,160
What if the two of them are together?

649
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,560
Then they will become the enemy team.

650
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,360
They will become my team.

651
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,160
That's good.

652
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
That's right, Yang Shan.

653
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Don't be too happy.

654
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,760
In the competition yesterday,

655
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,360
Brother Cheng didn't say anything.

656
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,360
He is the kind of person who doesn't talk much.

657
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,960
The netizen said,

658
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,160
Brother Cheng is Xu Xian.

659
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,960
What?

660
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,360
What Xu Xian?

661
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
What does Brother Cheng mean?

662
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,560
What Brother Cheng?

663
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,760
What do you mean by Brother Cheng?

664
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,960
What did you say?

665
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
What did you say?

666
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,560
Why did you kick me?

667
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,760
Who is Brother Cheng?

668
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,960
Fan Yushan.

669
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,560
Brother, let's go.

670
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,760
Let's go.

671
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,560
I should be the one to face it.

672
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,560
No one should be afraid of the wind.

673
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,160
Let's go.

674
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,760
Come on, let's fight.

675
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,560
Come on.

676
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,960
Yao Yao.

677
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Let's get back together.

678
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Let's go.

679
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,360
What's up?

680
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,560
Nothing.

681
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,960
Brother Cheng.

682
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,160
I have said what I should have said.

683
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,760
I didn't tell you before.

684
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
I broke up with you for a year.

685
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,960
But I've been here for a long time.

686
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,960
I didn't expect you to be so troublesome.

687
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,360
It also affected you.

688
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,560
I didn't blame you.

689
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,160
Why did you make this expression?

690
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,760
I just arrived at the team.

691
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,560
I didn't do anything.

692
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,760
So I caused such a big trouble.

693
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,560
And I still had a fight with K yesterday.

694
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,160
I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to get along with him.

695
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,760
But this operation yesterday,

696
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,560
he seemed not very happy.

697
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,960
Not like that.

698
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,160
But I heard from Xiao Pang.

699
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,360
You never had a negative news.

700
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,360
The first time I got a shot at this kind of thing.

701
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
I really feel very sorry for you.

702
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,160
You are a girl who comes to work.

703
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,560
You are all boys.

704
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,760
It's hard for you to be concerned about this.

705
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,960
I thought you were already in a hurry.

706
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,160
I did think so.

707
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,760
But I didn't expect it to be so serious.

708
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,760
When they are all over,

709
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,560
the rest of the attention will be on your achievements and strength.

710
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,360
The fastest one is when the champion of the national championship.

711
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,360
But the first question is whether you can get hurt.

712
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,160
I swear, Brother Cheng. I can do it.

713
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,960
Brother Cheng, don't worry. I will definitely take good care of Da Bing.

714
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,160
I promise you will be well-behaved.

715
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,160
What's wrong, Brother Cheng?

716
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,360
Why is your eyes red?

717
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,960
Nothing. I'm just being allergic.

718
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Is the smell of the old man real?

719
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm not happy anymore. I'm really touched.

720
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,960
I want to cancel the contract and transfer the people.

721
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,960
Your fans are threatening you.

722
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,360
You didn't have any phone.

723
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Actually, you don't have to care too much about what they said.

724
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,360
They said it as a joke.

725
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,360
If they don't want you to be in a relationship, they won't love you anymore.

726
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,360
In the ring, you transfer people and transfer the people.

727
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,680
This is normal.

728
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,960
Someone said that I didn't believe

729
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,160
you and Brother Cheng were shopping together.

730
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,440
I'm so angry.

731
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,280
I can do it.

732
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,240
Zhen Yi,

733
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,040
I lost my husband.

734
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
I lost my wife, too.

735
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,440
This strange news

736
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,480
is still on the news.

737
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,600
I'm a little worried about you.

738
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,440
As the only female player,

739
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,280
don't fall into this kind of

740
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,400
beginning, Miss.

741
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,120
What's wrong?

742
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,960
Look.

743
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,680
Look.

744
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,760
They said that I was shopping with you

745
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,720
and you.

746
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,520
They don't need to pay the cost.

747
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,440
I didn't even touch your hand.

748
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
You touched it now.

749
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,080
Are you still upset?

750
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,160
You touchedâ¦

751
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,400
Are you tired

752
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,760
of being your cat?

753
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,840
Tong Yao,

754
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,120
you used to feel that

755
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,760
our bed

756
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,240
is too difficult to handle.

757
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,400
Love is

758
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
rather miserable than success.

759
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,760
Therefore, you finally came to

760
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,600
stretch your arms

761
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,920
from the blind spot

762
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
You are a professional player now.

763
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,360
You should understand the game of professional players.

764
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,360
I really didn't mean to force you at that time.

765
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,960
I didn't want to break up with you at all.

766
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,560
KTV's things are all over.

767
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,560
I shouldn't have lied to you.

768
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,560
It's my fault.

769
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
I also apologize to you.

770
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
Yao Yao.

771
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Let's have a good talk, okay?

772
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,560
What are you doing?

773
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,960
You should wear a horse armor.

774
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
You should fight on the T-bar.

775
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,560
Am I that boring?

776
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,560
I think so. I just want to see you.

777
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Is it necessary?

778
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,160
I think it's necessary to send a Weibo to clarify this matter.

779
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,560
What do you mean?

780
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Me, you and Jian Yang

781
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,160
don't have any electric white snake.

782
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
No need.

783
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
No need?

784
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,160
I can't just ignore your innocence like this.

785
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,760
Go and see the Douban bricks yourself.

786
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,560
Chou Dan, don't be so greedy.

787
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,760
It's really you?

788
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,560
Why?

789
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,160
It's about Du Qiang. You should do it for a man.

790
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,960
Brother Cheng.

791
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,560
What are you doing? What are you looking at? Go back to sleep.

792
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,560
Although I don't know who will be your Mrs. Lu in the future,

793
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,960
I'm starting to envy her now.

794
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,160
Because you will protect her well.

795
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,360
She's not good at shooting, she's not good at flying.

796
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,760
What Mrs. Lu? Are you saying that you're weak?

797
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,860
Do you guys worry for our freedom?

798
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,860
Did you do it well?

799
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,160
Not that.

800
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:57,460
I think, to see howä¸å¯¹ America and Tony Cath ÐÐ¾Ð³Ð´Ð° perform with they...

801
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,460
Come.

802
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,460
Jian Yang, we are in the past.

803
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,460
Don't investigate any more.

804
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,460
You and Lu Si Chen?

805
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,460
Hello, bro.

806
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,460
Hello, Jiang.

807
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,460
I want to ask you something very important.

808
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,460
Do you want to ask about the relationship between Tong Yao and Lu Si Chen?

809
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,460
Don't worry.

810
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,460
They don't have anything.

811
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,460
They are all on the internet.

812
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,460
Don't worry.

813
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,460
I'll leave first.

814
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,460
Bye.

815
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,460
I want to hear it.
