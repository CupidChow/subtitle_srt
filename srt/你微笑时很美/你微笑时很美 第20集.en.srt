[Team DQ.Five's jungler, dragon, date with a woman other than his girlfriend]

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,910
The jungler of Team DQ.Five, Dragon,

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,370
date with a woman other than his girlfriend.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,030
When Dragon was livestreaming,

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,100
he was wearing completely different clothes from those in the photo.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,350
So the person photographed in the morning

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,520
definitely wasn't Xu Tailun.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Watching a movie?

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,590
You must have mistaken someone else for me.

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,300
At 2 PM in Wantai Cinema,

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,330
Smiling and Chessman were spotted.

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,670
What were these two doing?

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,670
Why did they watch a movie together?

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,150
Wasn't the time

15
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,930
exactly when the person suspected to be Xu Tailun

16
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,760
was watching that movie?

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,230
The background in that back view photo

18
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,030
was clearly also Wantai Cinema.

19
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,710
On the wall...

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,910
There were indeed a few people

21
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,310
who snuck in after the movie had started.

22
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,210
As for who they were,

23
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,830
if you're so curious,

24
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,580
why don't you ask him yourself?

25
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,080
Watch out, Dragon,

26
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,320
your secret is about to be exposed.

27
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,700
[Falling into your smile]

28
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,460
[Episode 20]

29
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,200
The current kill score is 7 to 5.

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,030
ZGDX is leading DQ.Five

31
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,570
by nearly 1,500 gold.

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,870
This doesn't make sense.

33
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,390
Dragon seems to have lost all rhythm today.

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,750
He's only focused on mid lane, only ganking mid.

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,940
This isn't the Dragon we usually know.

36
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,710
Look,

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,360
after clearing the upper camp,

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,040
he's again appearing at a time

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,829
when it's completely impossible and shouldn't happen,

40
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,150
in the upper bush of the mid lane,

41
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,320
preparing to ambush Smiling for the fifth time.

42
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,020
This is really going too far.

43
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,740
I knew it.

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,390
Is the enemy jungler planning to live in our mid lane?

45
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,550
Is there gold in our mid lane?

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,430
Yes, yes, why don't you come and see for yourselves?

47
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,430
Let's have the jungler and support roam together.

48
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,150
So noisy.

49
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,070
Nice!

50
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,050
Hakuro's ultimate

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,800
accurately pinned Yamakaze under the tower for a few seconds,

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,690
allowing it to take full damage from the tower.

53
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,630
He could even hit from this angle.

54
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,790
Dealing damage with Yamakaze.

55
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,750
The enemy thinks suppressing our mid lane is enough,

56
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,070
but don't forget, our bot lane is also a carry point.

57
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,510
Cheng's arrow could totally make it

58
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,310
to the top of the hero rescue highlights.

59
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:54,960
As the game has progressed to this point,

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
Pang and Chessman

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,030
have already started pushing towers in the bot lane.

62
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,270
Smiling, controlling Shiro,

63
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,270
just finished farming a minion wave.

64
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,310
Dragon, controlling Yamakaze, has snuck into mid lane again.

65
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,590
Dragon's Yamakaze rushes out from the bush,

66
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,630
launching his second skill.

67
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,150
At the same moment,

68
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,710
Smiling unhesitatingly blinks back under the tower.

69
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,750
The enemy immediately dashes to follow.

70
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,750
Smiling, your equipment isn't good enough.

71
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,510
Not enough damage. Retreat.

72
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,990
She uses her first skill to quickly deal a set of damage,

73
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,910
and slows Yamakaze in front of the tower with her third skill.

74
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,590
Yamakaze blinks directly onto Shiro's face,

75
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,750
uses his ultimate, then a combo to kill Shiro.

76
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,550
I feel that Smiling

77
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,060
must be feeling a bit frustrated now.

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,020
I told you I should have picked Yuki Onna.

79
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,870
This Xu Tailun today

80
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,110
is relentless, isn't he?

81
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,310
Constantly ganking.

82
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,430
It really feels like mindless targeting.

83
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,590
Let me be honest with you.

84
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,720
I think this is getting a bit impolite.

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,550
I really don't know

86
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,410
what on earth DQ.Five wants to do.

87
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,680
After watching the match for about ten minutes,

88
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,810
I only saw one thing:

89
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,030
they want to kill Smiling.

90
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,270
They're determined to kill Smiling.

91
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,440
They're insistent on killing Smiling.

92
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,829
I think you should watch what you say, Dudou.

93
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,940
Don't say I didn't remind you.

94
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,070
And don't ask me why.

95
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,680
Go check the comments from

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,660
Team DQ.Five's fans on your Weibo later,

97
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,990
and you'll understand.

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,410
K, come here for a moment.

99
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,340
Okay, I'm coming. I'm on my way now.

100
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,700
Don't go mid; there's no vision.

101
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,190
K's Puppeteer

102
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,670
already hide in the mid-lane river...

103
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,150
Coming.

104
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,360
to prevent Yamakaze from ambushing Smiling again.

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,490
There he goes again!

106
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,310
Dragon completely ignored the Puppeteer

107
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,340
and dashed straight towards Smiling.

108
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,800
At the same time, DQ's Week also arrived mid.

109
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,680
Dragon took down Smiling,

110
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,630
but he was also easily eliminated

111
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,680
by K's Puppeteer.

112
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,860
Is it worth it? A one-for-one kill.

113
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,190
Injure the enemy, but also lose yourself.

114
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,200
I think DQ.Five injured the enemy

115
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,410
and lost even more themselves.

116
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,100
This time, Dragon's gank on Smiling

117
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,520
was way too aggressive, wasn't it?

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah.

119
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,909
The game has now

120
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,250
reached the 20-minute mark.

121
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,780
ZGDX has already pushed to the mid inhibitor.

122
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,230
Cheng, I'm going for it. The position is perfect.

123
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,750
Okay.

124
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,030
Cat initiates the teamfight.

125
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,950
Smiling dashes in and slows down three enemies.

126
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,130
She directly uses her ultimate to knock them up.

127
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,620
Come on, come on!

128
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,350
Smiling was ganked too hard in the early game.

129
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,230
Her damage output is a bit awkward now.

130
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,550
-We can do it.
-Go! Go!

131
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,950
We can play this round.

132
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,870
-Don't retreat. Don't retreat.
-Go, go, go, go.

133
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,430
DQ.Five wants to fight this time.

134
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,310
There they go!

135
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,420
All skills have been used,

136
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,150
focused on Cat and Smiling.

137
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,140
Cat has fallen.

138
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,730
Now Chessman has room to deal damage.

139
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,970
Chessman is dealing crazy damage from behind.

140
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,060
One, two,

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,590
still going, three.

142
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,870
Four! Nice! A quadra kill!

143
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,080
Well done, Cheng.

144
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,270
Yamakaze, Yamakaze! Yamakaze has respawned!

145
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,130
Can we still save this, Yamakaze?

146
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,410
Yamakaze charges out!

147
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,530
No, defend the base! Defend the base!

148
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,790
Why are you chasing her? Defend the base!

149
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,070
This is going a bit too far, isn't it?

150
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,810
The enemy has already pushed to their base,

151
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,030
yet Dragon is still

152
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,370
relentlessly targeting Smiling.

153
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,440
It's as if taking down the enemy mid laner

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,080
is more important than defending their own base.

155
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,500
Yes, now ZGDX has no obstacles.

156
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,840
They're methodically destroying the enemy base.

157
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,820
Nice!

158
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,110
Let's congratulate once again

159
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,390
ZGDX for winning the match.

160
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,230
What were they thinking?

161
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,650
Why don't you go ask them?

162
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,590
Today was really bizarre.

163
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,970
What the hell was Xu Tailun doing?

164
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,600
K, what do you think he's really up to?

165
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,310
I can only tell he wants to kill Tong Yao.

166
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,420
I can't figure out anything else.

167
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,550
Doesn't he really believe

168
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,930
what Tong Yao said during her previous livestream,

169
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,530
using this to get back at her?

170
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,490
Hey, you.

171
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,580
I heard you didn't help clear his name and even made sarcastic remarks.

172
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,110
Why should I lie for him?

173
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,790
Well said. Lying is no good.

174
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,190
No way. Doing this in an official match?

175
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,550
Would his teammates even agree to this?

176
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,230
So what if they lose one group stage match?

177
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,850
Besides,

178
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,260
DQ.Five is a team that uses the "Protect the Carry" strategy.

179
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,750
Four Chinese players protecting one Korean player.

180
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,010
I really want to laugh.

181
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,110
See that, teammates?

182
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,930
This is what you call being sarcastic.

183
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,310
When it comes to sarcasm, you're the best.

184
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,730
I really admire you for that.

185
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,050
I'm going to the restroom.

186
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,030
Let's use the "Protect the Carry" strategy next game.

187
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm fine with any strategy.

188
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,590
They're targeting me so hard.

189
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,190
Even if I pick a tanky shikigami with full defensive items

190
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,890
and just sit in mid lane, I'll still get killed.

191
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,890
As long as we win the match, it's fine.

192
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,740
If he camps mid lane like this again next game,

193
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,860
could one of you please

194
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,390
report him for match-fixing after the match?

195
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,210
Impressive. I thought she would cry.

196
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,550
I thought so too.

197
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,690
She's probably too angry to cry.

198
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,060
Are you guys coming in or not?

199
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,920
Yes, yes, we're coming. Let's go.

200
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,230
Hey, Jinyang.

201
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,830
I'm so angry, sis.

202
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,930
I just saw that jerk Xu Tailun bullying you.

203
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,870
It makes me so mad.

204
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,770
What kind of behavior is that?

205
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,220
Does he have any professional ethics at all?

206
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,940
Exactly.

207
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,580
I'm really fed up with this.

208
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,350
That Xu Tai—

209
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,200
I'll talk to you later.

210
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,710
What's up?

211
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Nothing. Can't I talk to you?

212
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,790
Your Chinese is pretty good.

213
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,810
But no, you can't.

214
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,100
During that livestream,

215
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,680
why did you say those embarrassing words?

216
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,500
Wouldn't it have been better to just deny it?

217
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,230
I can say whatever I want to say.

218
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,610
Besides, I was being nice by not exposing you directly.

219
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,790
So in today's match,

220
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,760
you did this to get back at me?

221
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,290
Because I

222
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,300
am unhappy.

223
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,610
Your team lost the match because of you.

224
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,120
I don't care.

225
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,920
They...

226
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,790
won't object either.

227
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,430
I've led them to victory many times.

228
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,180
Being selfish once in a while

229
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,170
is not a big deal.

230
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,790
And I can do more.

231
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,140
Even in the next match,

232
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,030
we can quickly lose to your team.

233
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,280
But you have to promise me

234
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,830
to be a good girl.

235
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,230
Who are you looking for?

236
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,370
Lu Sicheng?

237
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,670
Stop looking.

238
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,150
Your teammates are all in the lounge.

239
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,830
No one will come to save you now.

240
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,210
I don't need anyone to save me.

241
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,470
Are you sick or something?

242
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,800
My mom said a loose tongue causes trouble.

243
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,920
What's going on?

244
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,390
What do you mean?

245
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,470
Look in the mirror. Your face is as white as a ghost.

246
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,540
I'm fine.

247
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,790
What's happening?

248
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,520
How did Dragon injure his hand?

249
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,870
I hope it won't affect the match.

250
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,840
You're fine?

251
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,900
Why do you and the other team's jungler

252
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,500
keep making googly eyes at each other?

253
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,350
What googly eyes?

254
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,280
I'm clearly glaring...

255
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,890
Never mind.

256
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,320
Let's play the match first.

257
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,390
Explain everything when we get back.

258
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,720
Don't come in unless you explain clearly.

259
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,990
For the last two positions,

260
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,800
let's choose Ibaraki Doji and Yuki Onna.

261
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,270
Okay.

262
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,550
Alright.

263
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,890
Everyone, do your best.

264
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,590
Got it.

265
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,990
Okay.

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Now both teams have made their selections

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,700
for the second match's shikigami lineup.

268
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,180
On ZGDX's side, the top laner Cat

269
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,600
has picked Kuro.

270
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,770
The jungler K is using Ibaraki Doji.

271
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,800
The mid laner Smiling is using Yuki Onna.

272
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,080
The ADC Chessman has chosen Chin.

273
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,700
And the support Pang is using Ichimokuren.

274
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,310
Looking at DQ.Five's side,

275
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,200
there's the top laner with Hannya, jungler with Mannendake,

276
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,930
mid laner with Higanbana, ADC with Youko,

277
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,070
and support with Ebisu.

278
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,060
The big battle is about to begin.

279
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,320
Let's wait for a moment

280
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,040
and enter the game right away.

281
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,550
The enemy's Mannendake

282
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,680
is already hiding in the mid lane bush.

283
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,390
Will this match be

284
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,750
a repeat of the last one?

285
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,070
Why is it starting again?

286
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,510
Yeah, what's going on?

287
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,750
But clearly, Smiling's Yuki Onna

288
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,670
is playing much more cautiously, only farming under the tower.

289
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,920
Mannendake has no opportunity...

290
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,590
Pang, come with me.

291
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,430
And can only return to his own jungle to farm.

292
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,630
Roger that. Let's go.

293
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,430
Dragon's Mannendake is counter-jungling

294
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,790
and got caught by Chessman.

295
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,350
He wants to kill him?

296
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,250
Mannendake used his blink.

297
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,140
Are they still going to chase?

298
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,750
Chase.

299
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,080
-What's the situation?
-What's going on?

300
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,990
I don't know.

301
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,620
The bottom lane duo starts roaming towards mid.

302
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,970
Chessman is going mid in the early game.

303
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,300
Is he giving up his lane?

304
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,790
You should know that the ADC's farm

305
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,150
is very crucial.

306
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,930
Camping for Smiling's Yuki Onna in mid lane

307
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,300
but failed.

308
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,940
Returning to bot lane to continue farming.

309
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,730
At this moment, Dragon emerges from the jungle.

310
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,750
Just as they left, he comes out to attack.

311
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,110
Lu Sicheng and Pang immediately rush back to mid,

312
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,350
making a quick return.

313
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,650
At this point, Yuki Onna is still alive,

314
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,050
throwing out her skills.

315
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,030
ZGDX's Chessman and Pang

316
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,280
arrive at mid lane at this moment.

317
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,350
They unleash a combo of skills,

318
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,550
taking down Dragon and Week,

319
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,010
completing a double kill.

320
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,590
It's too late, it's too late.

321
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,470
Nice.

322
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,410
Come to Octopus to fight, gather up.

323
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,050
I'm here.

324
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,270
-Coming.
-Coming.

325
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,470
Check if the enemy jungler is there.

326
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,430
Both teams have now reached level 15.

327
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,160
They've arrived at the Octopus simultaneously.

328
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,090
-We got it.
-They're fighting.

329
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,350
At this moment, Dragon...

330
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,390
Dragon suddenly flanked ZGDX's backline.

331
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,750
Smiling in the backline is in danger again.

332
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,110
Chessman and Pang both engaged.

333
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,570
The team fight continues.

334
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,070
Dragon is down again.

335
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,260
It's now a 4v5 situation.

336
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,300
Thanks for saving my life, Cheng.

337
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,740
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

338
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,600
Team wipe!

339
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,670
This game is decided.

340
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,190
ZGDX is about to take down the high ground.

341
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,350
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

342
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,710
Cheng, attack the tower!

343
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,910
Taking advantage of this team wipe,

344
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,710
ZGDX is methodically attacking the base.

345
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,290
Lu Sicheng isn't hitting the tower.

346
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,420
He's standing at DQ.Five's fountain.

347
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,450
Five, four, three, two, one.

348
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,620
Mannendake has respawned.

349
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,500
Chessman isn't hitting the base.

350
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
He charges into the enemy fountain.

351
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,150
What did I just see?

352
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,310
Dragon is killed by Chessman in the fountain.

353
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,530
Cheng is fountain killing!

354
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,550
Our Cheng has gone berserk today,

355
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,270
charging into the fountain like a fierce tiger pouncing on its prey

356
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,950
and gave Xu Tailun a good thrashing.

357
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,050
A heart like a fierce tiger, yet delicate enough to smell a rose.

358
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm talking about tigers here.

359
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,470
Why are you bringing up roses?

360
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,330
Get out of here!

361
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,550
We can see he's not even pushing the base anymore.

362
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,110
As soon as Dragon's Mannendake respawns,

363
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,470
he sends him right back to the fountain.

364
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,140
This is revenge for earlier.

365
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,730
Let me tell you,

366
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,730
if I were Smiling,

367
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,570
I'd be moved to tears, you know?

368
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,080
Incredibly touched.

369
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,950
Such a wonderful Chessman.

370
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,150
Such a great captain.

371
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,670
What more could one ask for?

372
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,220
It seems this "Protect the Carry" lineup

373
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,280
isn't about abandoning their mid laner to protect the ADC.

374
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,310
Instead, it's Chessman, the ADC,

375
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,770
taking the support to protect mid laner.

376
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,270
You bullied our mid laner, didn't you?

377
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,770
So I'll give you a taste of your own medicine.

378
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,520
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

379
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,250
Nice.

380
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,360
Congratulations to ZGDX

381
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,050
on winning their fifth match in the group stage.

382
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,170
Hello, Tong Yao.

383
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,310
Hello.

384
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,370
Hello, everyone, I'm Tong Yao.

385
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,630
Being mindlessly targeted like this in today's match,

386
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,510
are you angry?

387
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,430
I was a bit angry at first,

388
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,510
but then I wasn't angry anymore.

389
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,520
It doesn't matter who carries

390
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,980
as long as we win the match.

391
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,120
Besides, a strong team

392
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,060
should have carry potential everywhere.

393
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,320
Taking turns to carry.

394
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,310
Different positions carry

395
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,230
in each match.

396
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,350
That's very good.

397
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,230
Today, your teammates

398
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,930
adopted the "Protect the Carry" strategy

399
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,970
to protect your mid lane,

400
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,370
and secured the victory.

401
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,600
Do you have anything to say about this?

402
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,280
Cheng's Chin is very powerful.

403
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,880
Remember to ban it next time.

404
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,910
So today,

405
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,600
regarding the extreme tactics employed against you by the opposing team,

406
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,790
do you think they were effective?

407
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,390
Or at least, were they effective at some point?

408
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,460
I think

409
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,910
given that we had an advantage in the other two lanes,

410
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,830
targeting me wasn't effective.

411
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,030
My teammates are not pushovers either.

412
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,070
ZGDX is a team with three cores.

413
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,510
I believe that if any lane gets ahead,

414
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,460
they have the confidence to take over the game.

415
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,980
Do you agree with this attitude towards the game?

416
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,110
What's going on?

417
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,270
Your questions today are quite scary.

418
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,830
I don't know

419
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,090
if this is the opponent's strategy

420
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,890
or an individual player's idea.

421
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,710
But I think as a core member of the team,

422
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,790
one should be

423
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,130
responsible for his team and teammates.

424
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,030
That's the most basic thing, right?

425
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,710
There are rumors that it's because

426
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,930
some comments you made

427
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,330
during a livestream on the incident

428
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,080
regarding player Xu Tailun dating a fan

429
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,870
has led some people to believe it was true.

430
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,730
Do you think it's related to that?

431
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,390
I don't know what I said,

432
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,380
but

433
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,140
if there's nothing wrong with the person himself,

434
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,190
no one's words can create any drama.

435
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,180
I believe

436
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,780
player Xu Tailun knows this as well.

437
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,000
Why are you here?

438
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,330
Give me the microphone.

439
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,070
Today,

440
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,790
Smiling was just answering

441
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,720
your questions.

442
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,790
I sincerely hope that everyone present

443
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,120
can report accurately.

444
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,070
I don't want her to walk out of this door

445
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,400
and find her words completely distorted.

446
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,990
I know some media,

447
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,110
sometimes, to attract attention,

448
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,329
resorts to taking things out of context.

449
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:08,260
But this matter concerns the reputation of players.

450
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,200
Please be cautious about how you write

451
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,599
and what you write about.

452
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:17,980
Let's go.

453
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,089
Thank you.

454
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,590
So happy.

455
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,080
Lu Yue, you promised a game with me.

456
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,190
Let's solo.

457
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,590
I want to drink Rio, the iced one.

458
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,190
K's treat.

459
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,250
Why should I treat?

460
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,510
Because you got the MVP.

461
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,910
Smiling also got the MVP.

462
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,310
Smiling had two months' salary deducted.

463
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,630
They let me get the MVP

464
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,690
just because they want to gossip about me and Xu Tailun—

465
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,770
Let's go, let's go.

466
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,660
Speak.

467
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,790
Think it through before you speak.

468
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,680
During the halftime break,

469
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,200
I met Xu Tailun at the bathroom door.

470
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,010
He asked me, when I was asked about

471
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,330
the cinema incident in the livestream,

472
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,700
why didn't I help clear his name

473
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,750
and instead said some ambiguous things to stir up drama?

474
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,380
What did you say?

475
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,490
My mouth is on my face.

476
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,670
I could say whatever I want.

477
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,030
No problem. Then what?

478
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,460
Then he asked if he lost the game on purpose,

479
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,160
would that make me keep quiet?

480
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,830
We could win the game with our skills.

481
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,990
Why would I agree?

482
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,980
I said no,

483
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,230
then I bit him

484
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,140
and ran away.

485
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,550
What?

486
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,630
I ran away.

487
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,030
The previous sentence.

488
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,990
I said no.

489
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,250
The next sentence.

490
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,860
I bit him.

491
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,870
You told me not to hit people.

492
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,740
Biting should be okay, right?

493
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,980
It's not like I'll bite him to death.

494
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,660
So when the second match started,

495
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,380
Xu Tailun had his arm wrapped in bandages

496
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,510
because you bit him?

497
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,190
Yes.

498
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,900
Stay here. Don't go next door.

499
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,310
None of you are allowed to open the door for her.

500
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,950
Cheng,

501
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,790
what's wrong with her?

502
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,580
She looked for food in the trash can,

503
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,710
standing outside to air out the smell.

504
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,860
Trash can?

505
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,080
Is she really that unsanitary?

506
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Just ignore him.

507
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,970
She must have made my brother angry.

508
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,060
What's going on?

509
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,990
Pang, help me open the door.

510
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,500
I'm afraid I can't help you.

511
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,180
Mr. Lu's takeout is here.

512
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,500
Give it to me.

513
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,560
Miss,

514
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,660
on such a hot day,

515
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,550
what are you doing out here alone?

516
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
Feeding the mosquitoes.

517
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,610
Thank you.

518
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,710
Hey!

519
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,070
Two choices.

520
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,610
Either let me in,

521
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,830
or I'll be bitten to death by mosquitoes out here,

522
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,250
and you'll starve to death inside.

523
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:54,910
Your choice.

524
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,930
Your takeout is all here.

525
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,860
Please confirm.

526
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,080
No need. Thank you.

527
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,070
I want this one.

528
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,780
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

529
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,380
What's this? Hamburger?

530
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,730
Yeah, hamburger.

531
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,710
Let me get you a coffee.

532
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,460
Okay, thanks.

533
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,860
Hamburger.

534
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,510
I didn't order yours.

535
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,470
Yes, you did. I saw it.

536
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,490
Take it outside to eat.

537
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,850
Do you know what you did wrong?

538
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,200
Yes, I know.

539
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,540
What should you do if you encounter a situation like this again?

540
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,980
Turn and run, call the police, and call for help.

541
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,110
Who should you call?

542
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,980
Alright, I got it.

543
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,140
Who should you call?

544
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,870
You.

545
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,030
Sit down and eat.

546
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,110
This man is so fierce.

547
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,790
Why do you keep staring at him?

548
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,920
You don't even look away for a second.

549
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,790
Why... why are you here again?

550
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,570
Because you need me.

551
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,780
What's so good about this man?

552
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,400
What do you know?

553
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,660
He's Lu Sicheng, who can carry it all on the field.

554
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,310
His promotional photos are handsome enough to be a star.

555
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,190
He doesn't talk much in livestreams, occasionally teases fans.

556
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,270
My idol, he has no flaws.

557
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,640
Proud, arrogant, and sharp-tongued.

558
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,900
Always expressionless.

559
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,400
Too many tricks.

560
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,760
Teases teammates when he's in a good mood,

561
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,020
and becomes a nightmare when he's in a bad mood.

562
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,820
Doesn't wash his face or shave unless there's a match.

563
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,020
Having a ton of expensive casual clothes,

564
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,370
yet he loves wearing Pang's 39.9-yuan,

565
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,020
oversized shirts with free shipping from Taobao.

566
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,830
If you want to hear more, I can continue.

567
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,890
I'm not listening.

568
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,170
Pang,

569
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,650
are you fed on tissues?

570
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,820
I just put a new pack yesterday,

571
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,980
and today they're all gone.

572
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,710
How am I supposed to wipe my ass?

573
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,880
It seems even idols have to use the bathroom themselves.

574
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,390
Even so,

575
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,180
even if he's stripped of his idol halo,

576
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,160
he's still very attractive to me.

577
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,030
If even cursing and swearing

578
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,790
while holding up his pants looking for tissues

579
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,840
can be considered as cute,

580
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,820
then you're in big trouble.

581
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,200
Let's go.

582
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,550
Where are you going?

583
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,310
Taking Pancake to experience the life of an aristocratic cat.

584
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,670
Get in the car.

585
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,070
I'll give you a ride.

586
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,330
Where are you going?

587
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,190
To wash the car.

588
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,800
Didn't you just wash it the day before yesterday?

589
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,630
Get in.

590
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,780
Fasten your seatbelt.

591
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,840
Don't wander off. I'll come pick you up later.

Hello, I have an appointment today.

I have to rely on sleeping pills to fall asleep.

I know you.

603
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,330
You're the mid laner of Team ZGDX, right?

604
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,050
We met at the flower and bird market that day.

605
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,160
I was with Tailun.

606
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,520
What's wrong with the kitten?

607
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,340
It might be feline distemper.

608
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,040
And too many people at the base

609
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,470
caused stress and such.

610
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,020
I shouldn't have taken it to the cinema that day.

611
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,110
Tailun doesn't have time to take care of it,

612
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,040
so I brought it to the pet hospital.

613
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,920
But I need to clock in at the company later.

614
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,910
Could you please watch it for me?

615
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,240
I'll be back to pick it up in 10 minutes.

Here, good kitty.

If you didn't want to keep it, why did you buy it in the first place?

Miss,

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,510
did you hear what Xu Tailun said

during his livestream?

622
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,110

That was quick.

you know...

630
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,970
She brought the kitten for a check-up,

631
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,960
saying it might have some kind of weekly cat flu or something.

632
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,740
But from what I saw in the test results,

633
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,070
it's just a common cold.

635
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,460
how many games would one be suspended for stealing someone else's cat?

Keep your voice down.

They might think I'm really going to do something.

642

This is already someone else's cat.

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,790
We're raising it together.

672
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,440
He's even worse than that idiot Lee Kunsuk.

673
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,970
Good kitty.

674
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,940
What's wrong with you? You hate it but still want to watch.

675
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,870
Go away. Don't turn it off.

676
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,870
Even though I hate him,

677
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,920
it doesn't stop me from watching his livestream act.

678
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,980
This person is full of lies.

679
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,310
Someone who can lie as soon as they open their mouth

680
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,520
is quite rare, isn't it?

681
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
This is a living textbook,

682
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,150
teaching us

683
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,150
that men in the esports industry are not to be trusted.

684
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,490
What nonsense are you talking about?

685
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,690
Men are all liars.

686
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,930
You can't find a good one yourself

687
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,460
and talk nonsense here.

688
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,720
What do you mean I can't find a good one?

689
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,030
So it's my fault then?

690
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,280
Then tell me,

691
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,690
how many good men are there in the esports industry?

692
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,890
Who's good at gaming,

693
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,370
handsome, patient,

694
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,350
not messing around and not deceiving people.

695
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,080
There is one.

696
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,940
Who?

697
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,170
Me.

698
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,630
Me. Want to give it a try?

699
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,970
What are you saying?

700
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,130
What's going on?

701
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,830
Just saying.

702
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,330
Look at you, so easily being fooled.

703
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,740
Can you just say things like that casually?

704
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,240
Yes,

705
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,230
I can say whatever I want.

706
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,830
Don't you think the captain has been acting a bit strange lately?

707
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,560
For example?

708
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,640
First, he went out to watch a movie on a date, which is rare for him.

709
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
Then he started flirting in public.

710
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,780
He goes out often, even washing his car more frequently.

711
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,360
Now that you mention it,

712
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,560
the captain has indeed been acting strange lately.

713
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,240
Right?

714
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,040
Is that so?

715
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,790
Which part do you find particularly strange?

716
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,470
Recently, the captain...

717
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,100
has started drinking more water.

718
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,390
Men in the esports industry, huh.

719
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,380
I need some time alone.

720
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,410
Xu Tailun is in trouble!

721
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,420
Look at this.

722
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,220
Xu Tailun's cheating confirmed.

723
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,630
Xu Tailun deceives fans, with pictures as proof.

724
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,590
Scumbag liar.

725
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,910
Buy, buy, buy.

726
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,590
Who is this "In Your Name"?

727
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,320
It's confirmed that DQ.Five's jungler slept with a fan.

728
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,690
I bought a kitten from the flower and bird market today.

729
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,520
I'm happy.

730
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,160
It feels like I have a bond now, and something to care for.

731
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,090
Who on earth is this "In Your Name"?

732
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,460
Could this be the fan who was, you know...

733
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,830
Even bought clothes for him.

734
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,230
Why don't I have fans buying me clothes?

735
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,030
Because you don't have any fans.

736
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,560
But I have you.

737
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,540
Jerk.

738
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,750
Guoguo, you're not worthy of being Dragon's fan. Have you lost your mind?

739
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,600
Then who is this Guoguo who liked the post of

740
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,390
"In Your Name"?

741
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,110
Idiot.

742
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,300
Who else could it be?

743
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,940
Of course it's "In Your Name" herself.

744
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,050
I didn't expect this.

745
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,880
Isn't Xu Tailun always saying in his livestreams

746
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,870
that he and his girlfriend Ning Jiaqi

747
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,860
are so happy together?

748
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,400
And then showing off their love on Weibo.

749
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,520
Who knows which time it was

750
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,360
that became the last straw.

751
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,270
The girl was pushed to her limit

752
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,140
and directly unleashed a combo of moves.

753
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,930
A targeted explosion that took him out.

754
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,930
Nice.

755
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,960
Why are you all so gossipy?

756
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,780
He also said that other teams

757
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,070
didn't play OPL well.

758
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,350
I feel like I've been caught in the crossfire.

759
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,190
Pang just beat him so badly last week

760
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,550
in a practice match.

761
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,220
K dominated him in the jungle, making him tremble with fear.

762
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,390
And he said that others

763
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,590
didn't play OPL well.

764
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,850
This really can't be tolerated.

765
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,910
Can't tolerate it.

766
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,660
There's another new gossip.

767
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,680
Go ahead.

768
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,510
I'm a staff member of Team DQ.Five.

769
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,200
Hehe.

770
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,350
Team DQ.Five

771
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,870
has always been run by the Korean.

772
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,210
When he says go east, teammates don't dare go west.

773
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:09,949
Actually, last week

774
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,639
when they played against Team ZGDX,

775
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,889
even an idiot knew the other lanes

776
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,290
couldn't win at all with him ganking like that.

777
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,260
But they still did it that way.

778
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,889
Why?

779
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,420
Because the fan-sleeping jerk hates ZGDX's mid laner.

780
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,840
That day about the cinema incident,

781
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,370
she didn't speak up for him.

782
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,670
Why such hatred?

783
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,750
It's because their club's players

784
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,199
are too obedient to him.

785
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,100
He thinks all Chinese people are like this.

786
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,350
When one person stands up against him,

787
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,409
he's not used to it.

788
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,150
Let me see.

789
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,030
Arrogant.

790
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,239
Not all Korean players are like him.

791
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,750
OPL

792
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,060
also has good Korean players.

793
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,500
Pope, Xbang,

794
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,850
and Lee Kunsuk are good.

795
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,489
This kind of thing

796
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,739
is directly related to club discipline.

797
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,690
I think whether it's an all-Chinese team or with Korean players,

798
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,790
no matter how well you carry, you still need to follow the rules.

799
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,690
DQ.Five did well in the spring season,

800
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,489
but it was just a flash in the pan.

801
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,880
From the moment their club

802
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,550
tacitly allowed Xu Tailun to misbehave,

803
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,679
it was already over.

804
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,230
Now in OPL,

805
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,650
there are more than just one team

806
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,790
that are like DQ.Five where

807
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,790
Korean players have the most say and even

808
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,530
the management can't control it.

809
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,730
If this bad trend isn't corrected soon,

810
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,550
OPL

811
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,820
will be truly finished.

812
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,670
Finished.

813
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,020
It should have been dealt with long ago.

814
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,270
If domestic clubs

815
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,600
could all seriously reflect on the issue of Korean imports,

816
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,150
then this scandal being exposed

817
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,480
might not be a bad thing.

818
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,450
This industry should have been cleaned up long ago.

819
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,920
Such a strong sense of justice.

820
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,370
After verification,

821
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,900
Xu Tailun has committed a serious violation.

822
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,610
First, in the game between DQ.Five and ZGDX,

823
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,250
the player played negatively

824
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,230
and the situation was serious.

825
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,270
Second, Xu Tailun's private life is inappropriate,

826
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,910
which greatly affected the image of the esports industry

827
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,640
and caused a bad social impact.

828
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,600
According to the OPL rules,

829
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,460
the player is suspended for one season

830
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,120
and will be fined 10,000 yuan.

831
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,470
Meanwhile, the club is poorly managed.

832
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,020
The DQ.Five club has been given a serious warning

833
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,620
and fined 100,000 yuan.

834
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,520
Congratulations to Team DQ.Five on their victory.

835
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,420
Now, let's welcome their team captain, Dragon,

836
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,350
to share his thoughts on the match.

837
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:21,920
It's a great honor

838
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,560
that our team was able to win this match.

839
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,390
And then,

840
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,120
I not only want to thank my teammates,

841
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,750
but here,

842
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,680
I also want to thank someone.

843
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,250
It's because of her

844
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,330
that our team has been able to

845
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,790
gradually grow stronger.

846
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,530
I also hope that this person

847
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,990
can continue to accompany us on our journey.

848
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,880
Great!

849
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,820
Heart sign!

850
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,220
Heart sign!

851
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:57,710
Nice!

852
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,310
Let's go, brothers.

853
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,570
I'm treating tonight.

854
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,310
Let's go! Great, let's go!

855
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,670
Time to eat! Let's go!

856
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,190
Do you like it?

857
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,670
It's pretty good.

858
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,420
Can I take a photo with you?

859
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,730
Let's use my phone,

860
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,460
okay?

861
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,520
Come on.

862
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,220
Okay.

863
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,060
Come on, smile.

864
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,990
Three, two, one.

865
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,280
Good.

866
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,140
Can I take a look?

867
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,860
I'll send it to you next time.

868
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,570
Well,

869
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,640
blow out the candles.

870
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,000
Guoguo, are you okay?

871
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,320
Your Weibo has been cleared.

872
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,540
Are you leaving the industry?

873
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,430
I don't understand why you did this.

874
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,310
Didn't we agree

875
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,710
not to talk about these things?

876
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,830
Xu Tailun has been suspended.

877
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,390
You're the one who betrayed Xu Tailun.

878
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,060
It's because of you.

879
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,030
You've also betrayed us.

880
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,740
You really are a vicious woman.

881
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,740
Guoguo, let it go.

882
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,270
If I had known he was this kind of person from the beginning,

883
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,870
I wouldn't have been his fan at all.

884
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,310
This week is his last match in China.

885
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,290
Are you coming?

886
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,030
Stop messing around.

887
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,840
Miss Tong Yao,

888
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,790
thank you for coming.

889
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,390
Thank you.

890
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,690
Everything is ready inside.

891
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,690
This way, please.

892
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,670
The interview hasn't started yet.

893
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,930
Why don't we go inside and sit for a while?

894
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,280
Hasn't the interview started yet?

895
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,060
Given what happened with Xu Tailun,

896
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,940
so...

897
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,040
Then I'll go buy some food first.

898
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,950
I'll be back soon.

899
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,420
Alright, take the umbrella with you.

900
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,450
Okay, thank you.

901
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,810
Are you alright?

902
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,430
I'm just too greedy.

903
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,120
At first, I just wanted to watch him from afar.

904
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,420
Gradually, it turned into wanting to be with him.

905
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,720
Then I became dissatisfied and started to be picky.

906
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,940
Just because I couldn't have him,

907
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,690
I became irritable, anxious, and hysterical.

908
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,380
Did I destroy him with my own hands?

909
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,760
If you had known it would turn out like this, why did you even start?

910
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,250
Cheng,

911
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,790
why are you here?

912
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,950
The interview suddenly changed to a two-person interview,

913
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,790
so I came.

914
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,430
How did you end up like this?

915
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,290
Didn't they give you an umbrella?

916
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,710
They did.

917
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,550
There was a little accident.

918
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,170
I gave the umbrella to someone else.

919
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,140
Where are the interviewers?

920
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,150
They haven't arrived yet.

921
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,730
I just saw some fans still at the entrance.

922
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,970
Looking at those fans,

923
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,560
I kind of feel bad.

924
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,020
Why do you think they come?

925
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,470
What are they pursuing exactly?

926
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,510
A hero in their hearts?

927
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,730
Or the image they've created in their minds?

928
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,480
Actually, those people on stage

929
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,870
are not as great as they imagine.

930
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,790
Some might even be worse

931
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,420
than the fans themselves.

932
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,720
What's wrong?

933
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,560
That's what I should be asking you.

934
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,740
I just saw that girl.

935
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,890
The one with Xu Tailun.

936
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
I disliked her at first,

937
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,770
but now I feel

938
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,110
that it's kind of

939
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,470
sad of her being a fan.

940
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,850
Fans,

941
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,420
always like to think of the people they like

942
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,790
as perfect,

943
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,510
whether it's Xu Tailun

944
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,790
or us.

945
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,890
Disregarding the feelings of those who like us,

946
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,320
doing whatever we want,

947
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,030
being exposed,

948
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,350
being destroyed.

949
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,710
Thinking about this,

950
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,690
I feel that our industry

951
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,360
might not be worth being liked by others.

952
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,370
It's not as bad as you think.

953
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,870
At least our teammates

954
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,470
are doing pretty well, aren't they?

955
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,170
They're all at the training base all day,

956
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,450
almost turning ZGDX into a monastery.

957
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,780
We can't judge everyone

958
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,430
based on one or two people.

959
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,950
That's not fair.

960
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,600
Besides, I've told you before.

961
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,030
I'm a good person.

962
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,530
But your current thoughts

963
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:14,650
make me worried.

964
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,070
Worried?

965
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,560
Before I even get a chance to say it,

966
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,110
you've already given up hope on this industry.

967
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,030
That's too bad.

968
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,560
In this industry,

969
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,220
there are still many good men.

970
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,500
Rich and handsome,

971
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,860
good at gaming and not sleeping with fans,

972
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,330
treating the training base like a monastery,

973
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,730
might even reciting sutras every morning.

974
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,830
Who?

975
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,390
Me.

976
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:41,020
So,

977
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,030
I'll ask you the same question again.

978
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,200
Do you want to give it a try?

979
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,960
Try what?

980
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,250
Me.
