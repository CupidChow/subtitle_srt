1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,040
Superb!

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,000
It doesn't make sense!

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,440
Is he drunk tonight?

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,640
If he doesn't drink I could use the toilet for him

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,720
to get a spokesman for someone else.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,800
I told her,

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,360
Let me finish this for you!

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,320
I should have let you take it first,

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,920
but runterzh reportedly needs to come first.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,740
Together we didn't see each other anymore.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
Now he is tidak you!

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,920
What are you doing?

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,560
You're looking at a movie.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,800
It's not the right time

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,240
for the person who is watching the movie

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,960
in the same direction as Xu Tai Lun.

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,520
The movie that was shot

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,240
is also a film.

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,920
The movie is on the wall.

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,080
The movie was shot

21
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,440
when the audience was watching the movie.

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,640
It was blackened out.

23
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,520
Who is it?

24
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,040
You're so curious.

25
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,240
Why don't you ask him yourself?

26
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,520
Be careful, Dragon.

27
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Your secret

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,680
will be exposed.

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,600
The movie is about

30
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,480
the person who is watching the movie.

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,600
The movie is about

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
the person who is watching the movie.

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,280
The movie is about

34
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,720
the person who is watching the movie.

35
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,840
The movie is about

36
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,120
the person who is watching the movie.

37
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,400
The movie is about

38
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,080
the person who is watching the movie.

39
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,440
The movie is about

40
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,960
the person who is watching the movie.

41
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,240
The movie is about

42
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,640
the person who is watching the movie.

43
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,040
The movie is about

44
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,320
the person who is watching the movie.

45
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,520
The movie is about

46
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,080
the person who is watching the movie.

47
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,480
The movie is about

48
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,960
the person who is watching the movie.

49
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
The movie is about

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,880
the person who is watching the movie.

I am too strong

A stack ofρεЫ is also waiting for our mid

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,780
Can we get the gold chance

60
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,220
Yes

61
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,640
Check this out

You are stopping Nvp

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,220
He is and nvp

70
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,720
Can we beat this one

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,840
Do you think that the Mid Zack

72
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,180
Can we investigate only the yeti

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,800
In the whole match

74
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,960
we can take on

75
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Is he really using an US economy direction?

76
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,060
the situation

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,420
the familiarodge behavior is getting worse

gewaizenshu

79
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm not saying this to learn from you.

80
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,260
Today, Xu Tai Lun is not alone, right?

81
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,260
He's been catching.

82
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,540
It's really a mess.

83
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,700
To be honest,

84
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,980
I think it's a bit unreasonable.

85
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,700
I really don't know what DK5 wants to do.

86
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,900
After watching the game for more than ten minutes,

87
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,100
I saw one thing.

88
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,220
They want to kill Smiling.

89
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,460
They have to kill Smiling.

90
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,780
They insist on killing Smiling.

91
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,060
I think you should stop talking nonsense, Du Du.

92
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,180
I didn't remind you.

93
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,300
Don't ask me why.

94
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,900
Later, you can go and see your Weibo

95
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,620
and find out the comments of the fans of DK5.

96
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,620
Come here, Mr. K.

97
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,340
I'm coming.

98
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
I'll be right there.

99
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,860
Don't go to the middle.

100
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,860
There's no vision.

101
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,460
Mr. K's back is in the middle.

102
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,180
In addition to the free-range and free-range Smiling,

103
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,020
he's in the middle.

104
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
He's in the middle.

105
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,820
I'm really going to go up.

106
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,180
I'm going to fight against him.

107
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,340
I'm not going to go to the middle.

108
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,140
I'm going to go to the middle.

109
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,620
I'm not going to go to the middle.

110
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,940
I'm going to fight against him.

111
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,860
But I'm also going to fight against Mr. K's back.

112
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,220
I'm going to fight against him.

113
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,220
This is the first one.

114
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,220
I'm going to fight against him.

115
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,500
I think DK5 is the top 800.

116
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,820
He's the top 100.

117
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,900
Isn't it too much for Dragon and Smiling to catch?

118
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,620
Yes.

119
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,620
The game has been played

120
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,180
and the 20-minute ZZDX

121
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,700
has pushed the high ground of the middle.

122
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,460
I'm going to fight against him.

123
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,580
I'm also going to fight very well.

124
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,380
Mr. K, open the group.

125
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,900
The second group is going to pick up the third person.

126
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,140
Open the group.

127
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
Come on.

128
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,340
The first group is too bad.

129
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
Now the injury is a bit bad.

130
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,220
Yes.

131
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,580
It's okay.

132
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,140
You can't fight.

133
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,100
You can't fight.

134
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,580
DK5 wants to fight.

135
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,540
He's fighting.

136
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,660
All the group is fighting.

137
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,740
Mr. Smiling is fighting.

138
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,260
Mr. Smiling is down.

139
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,940
This is the space for the kickback.

140
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,940
The second group is going to fight.

141
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,140
One, two.

142
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,940
The child continues.

143
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,140
Three, four.

144
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,940
The beautiful four.

145
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,100
That's great, Chen.

146
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Four.

147
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,380
Shen Feng.

148
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,340
Shen Feng is dead.

149
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,180
He can't save him.

150
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,140
Shen Feng.

151
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,380
Shen Feng, get out.

152
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,020
No.

153
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,620
It's the first place.

154
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,700
Why are you chasing him?

155
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,620
It's the first place.

156
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,100
This is a bit too much.

157
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,740
The opponent has pushed the first place.

158
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:28,980
Yes.

159
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,940
The second group is still

160
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,380
fighting against Mr. Smiling.

161
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,180
It seems that

162
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,460
the middle of the opponent

163
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,100
is more important than the first place.

164
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,620
Yes.

165
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,580
But ZZDX has no main case.

166
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,780
There is a mistake.

167
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,140
You have to take the first place.

168
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
You're so stupid.

169
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,900
ZZDX.

170
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,940
ZZDX.

171
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,940
Congratulations again.

172
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,540
You won the game.

173
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,380
What are they thinking about?

174
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,540
What are they thinking?

175
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,100
Is it really Mo Ming?

176
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,620
Qin Miao?

177
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,980
What the hell is he doing?

178
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,620
Kei, what do you think he wants to do?

179
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,340
I just saw that he wanted to kill Tong Yao.

180
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,460
I didn't see anything else.

181
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,060
Could it be that when Tong Yao was live,

182
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,660
he was so angry with me.

183
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,820
Hey, friend.

184
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,300
I heard that you didn't help him

185
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,700
to wash the white clothes.

186
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,460
What's the point of helping him to lie?

187
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,180
It's okay.

188
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,420
I can't lie.

189
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,100
No way.

190
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,340
It's really a game.

191
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,740
The team can agree.

192
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,380
So what's wrong with the team?

193
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,180
Besides,

194
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,420
DQ5 is the team of four treasures.

195
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,660
The four Chinese

196
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,900
and one Korean.

197
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,220
I really want to drink.

198
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,300
See the team?

199
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,020
This is called Yin Yang Monster.

200
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,860
Yin Yang Monster is really like you.

201
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,300
I'll go to the bathroom.

202
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,260
I'll go to the bathroom.

203
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,820
You can do anything.

204
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,700
It's so important.

205
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,220
Even if I have a final record,

206
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,300
I'll just sit in the middle.

207
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,060
I'll be killed by Zhao Yan.

208
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,100
I'll win the game.

209
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,940
Xia Ba is still living in the middle.

210
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,100
Please report to the team

211
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,820
after you finish the game.

212
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,580
He's going to cancel the game.

213
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,180
That's great.

214
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,500
I thought he would cry.

215
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,780
I also think so.

216
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,900
I guess he's angry.

217
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,260
Are you guys going in?

218
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,100
Go in.

219
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,260
Let's go.

220
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,860
Lets go.

221
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,580
Hello, Jing Yang?

222
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,240
Gorgeous, slip yesterday.

223
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,460
When I saw Xu Tan where he was bullying you,

224
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,260
I was so angry.

225
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,100
How could he do so?

226
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,700
Is there anything out of frying蘋果?

227
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,620
Right.

228
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,060
I was just Wen.

229
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
Xu ...

230
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,820
Let me talk to you again.

231
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,020
I'm sorry.

232
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,740
What's the matter?

233
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,020
Master Wei is looking for you.

234
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,420
The Chinese language is good,

235
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,700
but it's not good.

236
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,660
Why did you say

237
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,100
that kind of thing

238
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,300
was hard to watch on the live broadcast?

239
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,460
Is it bad for you to deny it?

240
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,140
What are you talking about?

241
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,260
Besides, you're not

242
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,820
wearing it directly.

243
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,740
You're not wrong.

244
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,780
So, today's competition,

245
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,740
you're doing it

246
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,900
because you're trying to revenge me?

247
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,260
Because I'm not happy.

248
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,940
Because you lost the competition

249
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,660
because of your team?

250
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,220
I don't care.

251
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,940
They...

252
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,780
They won't object.

253
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,060
I've already won them many times.

254
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,660
I'm so proud of them.

255
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,300
I have no big problem.

256
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,060
And I can do more.

257
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,220
Even in the next competition,

258
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,820
I'll lose to you soon.

259
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,140
But you have to promise me

260
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,900
to be a good girl.

261
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,740
Who are you looking for?

262
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,380
Lu Si Cheng?

263
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,660
Don't look.

264
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,820
Your teammates are resting.

265
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,020
No one will come to save you at this time.

266
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,980
I don't need any help.

267
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,180
Are you sick?

268
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,020
I'm sick from the mouth.

269
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,140
You'll be sick from the mouth.

270
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,140
Are you really sick from the mouth?

271
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,900
Yeah.

272
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,980
Do you want me to do...

273
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,060
He said that it's not okay.

274
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,260
Just...

275
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,980
He said that she's too wordless.

276
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,100
She's tooтак and an organized person.

277
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,820
I hope

278
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,940
that it can speed up your performance

279
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,220
and spare your efforts.

280
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,700
And

281
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,300
just look at the feeling if the appearance is serious

282
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,940
and patient.

283
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,940
You don't have to happen 4 times in a row.

284
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,620
Hurry up.

285
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,700
Come on, hurry up.

286
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:47,980
Come on, hurry up.

287
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,700
You take it.

288
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,220
Taking 60baht.

289
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Wasn't it hard to get out of home?

290
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,100
Take standing?

291
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,260
I'll understand.

292
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,740
You can be on hold over,

293
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,700
and I'll recognize you when putting up bulky sum of clothes.

294
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,100
Wow, we got这个 Store Put in avionics.

295
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,280
Nice dates.

296
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,040
It's not a big deal.

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What did you do

298
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,220
with the other team's team

299
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,060
that didn't come with that expression?

300
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,380
We didn't come with that expression.

301
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
It's such a useful word.

302
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,260
I sense it's not...

303
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Forget it.

304
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,260
It's a match first.

305
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,560
Go back and teach everything.

306
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:32,400
It's那就

307
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,040
in the final two positions.

308
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,500
Choose Cecilia and refused.

309
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,740
Okay.

310
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,780
It looks interesting.

311
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,500
Okay.

312
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,740
Come on, everyone.

313
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,340
Okay.

314
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,740
Okay.

315
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,940
Okay, both teams have chosen

316
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,620

317
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,660

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,780
wins the black bell.

320
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Now the black baby will end up with Cecilia.

321
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,620
That means the Spaceож is whipped by Snow Sunüs,

322
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,100
while the WiFi are fat as ice.

323
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
And the fat one,

324
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,460
is Nemueng.

325
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,060
The First 5,

326
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,220
the cover that was released was

327
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,020
the achievement of a Poison City

328
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,980
in the middle of the wild.

329
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,920
The surprise attack of regions are everywhere.

330
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,020

331
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,380
Kang Dujun

332
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,280
Great!

333
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,560
Good job!

334
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,880
The Snow Queen of the Manic

335
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,480
has surrounded many

336
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,160
and only have been killed.

337
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
The Manic...

338
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Come with me.

339
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
I've got it.

340
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,840
Let's go.

341
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,080
The Manic of the Dragon

342
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,920
was caught by the Chessmen at night.

343
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,440
It seems he wants to kill them.

344
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
The Manic of the Manic is in the middle of the forest.

345
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,280
Is he still chasing them?

346
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,920
Yes.

347
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,280
What's going on?

348
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,160
I don't know.

349
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Come on.

350
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560

Come on.

352
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,160
Hello?

353
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,560
The two of them are going to the middle.

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,960
Chessmen is going to the middle.

355
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Are you going to the middle?

356
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
It's very important to know

357
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
the development of the team.

358
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,960
The Snow Queen of the Manic in the middle.

359
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
The Manic of the Manic.

360
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,560
The next round is the development.

361
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,560
I'm going to kill them with my special skill.

362
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,560
I just killed them from behind.

363
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,960
The Snow Queen of the Manic

364
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,160
is in the middle of the forest.

365
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,360
She killed the Ma Xiang.

366
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,760
The Snow Queen of the Manic is still alive.

367
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,160
She's going to the middle.

368
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
The Chessmen and the Manic of the Manic

369
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,360
are going to the middle.

370
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm going to kill them with my special skill.

371
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm going to kill them with my special skill.

372
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,160
It's too late.

373
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Yes.

374
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,160
Come out and fight.

375
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,160
I'm here.

376
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I'm coming.

377
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,560
Let's see if they can fight.

378
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Both teams have reached the 15th level.

379
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,760
They've reached the 10th level at the same time.

380
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
They're fighting.

381
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,360
The Chessmen and the Manic

382
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
have all been defeated by the ZGDX.

383
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
The Chessmen and the Manic are in danger again.

384
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,160
Chessmen and the Manic are fighting together.

385
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
The Chessmen and the Manic are still alive.

386
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
The Chessmen and the Manic are gone again.

387
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,160
It's the fourth and fifth day.

388
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,960
The Chessmen and the Manic are in danger again.

389
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,560
It's hard to walk in my hometown.

390
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Perfect.

391
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,760
There's no more blood.

392
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,360
They're going to be destroyed by the ZGDX.

393
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
The Chessmen and the Manic are in danger again.

394
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Chen, you're in A-tank.

395
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
I'm in the group.

396
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,560
The ZGDX has a hidden A-tank.

397
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,960
The Chessmen and the Manic are not in danger.

398
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,160
They're standing under the first monster's water.

399
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

400
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,360
The Manic is back to life.

401
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,960
They're in the group.

402
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,360
The Chessmen and the Manic are in danger.

403
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
What did I see just now?

404
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
The Chessmen and the Manic are in danger again.

405
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
Chen is in the group.

406
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,560
Chen is in the group today.

407
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,160
He's in the group.

408
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
He's in the group.

409
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,760
He's in the group.

410
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,160
The Manic is in danger again.

411
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm telling you.

412
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,560
What kind of danger are you telling me?

413
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,160
You're a fool.

414
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
We can't even see the base.

415
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,160
As long as the Manic is alive,

416
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,360
we'll send him back to the group.

417
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,960
This is the revenge I've been holding.

418
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm telling you.

419
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,560
I'll kill you.

420
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
I'm so touched.

421
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Do you know?

422
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm so touched.

423
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,160
The Chessmen and the Manic are so good.

424
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,960
They're not in a good mood.

425
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm afraid that

426
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,160
this treasured title

427
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,360
will not be given to the Chessmen and the Manic.

428
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
But Chessmen and the Manic

429
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,560
will help to protect the Chessmen and the Manic.

430
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,160
Didn't you go to our Chessmen and the Manic?

431
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,760
Then I'll give it a try.

432
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,360
A little bit of blood.

433
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,160
Nice.

434
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,360
Congratulations to ZGDX

435
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,960
for winning the game.

436
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,760
Hello, ZGDX.

437
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Hello, host.

438
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Hello, everyone.

439
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,960
I'm Tong Yao.

440
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
Is the game

441
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,960
that you're angry with the team?

442
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,960
I was a little angry at the beginning.

443
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,560
I wasn't angry at the beginning.

444
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,760
The game won.

445
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,160
Everyone is the same.

446
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Besides,

447
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,560
a strong team

448
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,360
should be the same everywhere.

449
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,560
The Chessmen and the Manic.

450
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Every game

451
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
has different positions to be the same.

452
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
So,

453
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
the team today

454
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
will use the strategy of

455
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
using the four treasures

456
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
to protect the team.

457
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,160
And they won the game.

458
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,560
Do you have anything to say about this?

459
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,960
Brother Cheng is really good.

460
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,160
He's going to be the next player.

461
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Then, today,

462
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
do you think

463
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,560
the extreme tactics

464
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
that the opponent took

465
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
or at least used them?

466
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I think

467
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
the other two ways

468
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,560
are both useful.

469
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,560
It's useless for me.

470
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
My teammates are not jealous.

471
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,960
ZGDX is the third team.

472
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
I believe that

473
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,160
there will be new results

474
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
in the future.

475
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Do you think this game is too much?

476
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
What's going on?

477
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
You're asking a terrible question today.

478
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,360
I don't know

479
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,760
whether the opponent's strategy

480
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,560
is the idea of the player.

481
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,760
But I think

482
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,560
as a core of the team,

483
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
we should do

484
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
the action of

485
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,960
the teammates and the team.

486
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,560
That's the most basic.

487
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
There's a rumor that

488
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,360
it's because of the previous

489
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,560
meeting between the Xu Tai Lun player

490
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,960
and the fans.

491
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,760
In the live broadcast room,

492
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,160
some of your comments

493
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,960
made people think

494
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,560
this is a fact.

495
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,560
Do you think this is related to it?

496
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
I don't know what I said.

497
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
But

498
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
if this person

499
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,160
has no problem,

500
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,760
no one

501
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,360
can take any rhythm.

502
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,560
I believe

503
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Xu Tai Lun's player

504
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
knows this.

505
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,960
Why are you here?

506
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,760
Director Huang,

507
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
why are you here?

508
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Today,

509
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,960
Smelling is just

510
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,360
answering your questions.

511
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,160
I hope that

512
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,760
everyone in the arena

513
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,360
can report it in person.

514
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,960
I don't want to wait

515
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,160
until he leaves the door

516
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
and finds out

517
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
that he's completely interesting.

518
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,960
I know that some media

519
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,560
sometimes

520
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,160
do some dirty tricks

521
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,360
to make a mistake.

522
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,960
But the world

523
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,360
is full of players.

524
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
How to write?

525
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Where to write?

526
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Wang Shizhou.

527
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Let's go.

528
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,360
Thank you.

529
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Let's go.

530
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Happy.

531
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,760
Lu Yue,

532
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
let's finish the game.

533
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
Let's go.

534
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,560
Let's go.

535
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Let's go.

536
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:37,960
Let's go.

537
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,760
Why do I have to go?

538
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,360
You got the MVP.

539
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,560
Smelling got the MVP.

540
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
Smelling was paid

541
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,160
for two months.

542
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,360
They asked me to get the MVP

543
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,760
because they wanted to gossip.

544
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
I and Mr. Xu Tai Lun...

545
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Tell me.

546
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Think about it and then say it.

547
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,960
When I was resting in the middle of the arena,

548
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,360
I met Xu Tai Lun

549
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
at the door of the washroom.

550
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,360
He asked me

551
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
about the thing

552
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
that happened in the cinema

553
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
before the live broadcast.

554
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Why didn't he help him wash the dishes?

555
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
And he said some

556
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
dirty words to make up for it.

557
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
What did you say?

558
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
He said it to me.

559
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
What did I say?

560
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
It's okay.

561
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Then what?

562
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
Then he asked me

563
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
whether I can shut up

564
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
by playing the game.

565
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Why did he let me

566
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
win the game?

567
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
I said I can't.

568
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Then he said yes.

569
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Then he said yes.

570
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Then he ran away.

571
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
What?

572
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I ran away.

573
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
You said you can't.

574
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I said no.

575
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
You said no.

576
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
The last one.

577
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I said yes.

578
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
You said you didn't let me beat him.

579
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
I said yes.

580
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
I can beat him.

581
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
I won't beat him to death.

582
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
So when the second game

583
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
started,

584
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Xu Tai Lun was holding a sandal

585
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
on his arm.

586
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
You said yes.

587
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Yes.

588
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Stand here.

589
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Don't make a move.

590
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
I'm going to wait for you.

591
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Excuse me.

592
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
senior

593
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
senior

594
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
all is your senior

595
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
senior

596
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
senior

597
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
senior

598
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
senior

599
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
senior

600
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
senior

601
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
senior

602
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
senior

603
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
senior

604
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
senior

605
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
senior

606
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,920
You're angry, aren't you?

607
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,320
What?

608
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,080
Fatty, open the door for me.

609
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,520
I can't live without you.

610
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,000
Girl, it's windy inside.

611
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
How nice of you to be called like that.

612
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,600
Don't you think?

613
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,520
I'mですね,

614
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,200
a girl from the taxi service.

615
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,800
There's 3 cars outside.

616
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,920
Mr. Lu,

617
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
this is for me, these are for me.

618
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,440
Girl,

619
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,680
why are you alone

620
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,120
is it additionally, outside?

621
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,680
Either put me in

622
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,720
or I'll be bitten by mosquitoes

623
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,120
and you'll be starved to death.

624
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,800
Go on.

625
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Your delivery is here.

626
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,720
Please order.

627
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,400
No need.

628
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,000
Thank you.

629
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,840
I want this.

630
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,200
Here you are.

631
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,840
Thank you.

632
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,800
What's this?

633
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,720
Hanbao?

634
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,720
Hanbao?

635
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,040
Here you are.

636
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,800
Okay.

637
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Thank you.

638
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,000
Hanbao.

639
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,520
I didn't hear you.

640
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,800
I saw it.

641
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,400
Take it out.

642
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,480
Did you know I was wrong?

643
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,280
I know.

644
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,120
What if I meet you again?

645
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,680
You run away.

646
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,360
Call the police.

647
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,120
Call the police.

648
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,800
Who?

649
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,160
Okay. I know.

650
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,880
Who?

651
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,040
You.

652
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,960
Sit down and eat.

653
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,000
You.

654
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,040
You.

655
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,720
Make way.

656
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,280
This person is so fierce.

657
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,160
Why have you been hear him?

658
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,960
And 치 you're not mindless,

659
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,880
how did you hide from me?

660
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,360
Secondary.

661
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,160
Someone nice?

662
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,280
You drew a small ear and a little fan in the live room.

663
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,320
My idol, they didn't have any shortcomings.

664
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,680
They are proud, self-respecting, and being stubborn.

665
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,960
They are used to being shy.

666
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
They are not familiar with the way they are dressed.

667
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,800
When they are in a good mood, they are focused on their teammates.

668
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,040
When they are in a bad mood, they are being stubborn.

669
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,840
As long as they don't play, they don't wash their faces or look like a fox.

670
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,640
They are obviously a bunch of people.

671
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,280
They are all very expensive.

672
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,320
But they are all wearing small pants, 39.9 yuan.

673
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,040
A big shirt that is full of treasure.

674
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,840
If you still want to listen, I can still continue to say,

675
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,560
I don't listen. I don't listen.

676
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,080
Xiaopang,

677
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,880
did you grow up with a purple scarf?

678
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,840
You put a new one in your bag yesterday.

679
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,160
It's gone today.

680
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,840
How did I wipe my butt?

681
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,200
It seems that the idol has to go to the toilet in person.

682
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,800
Even if it is like this,

683
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,440
even if he takes the idol's crown,

684
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,560
he still likes it.

685
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,840
If he even asks the girl to find a purple scarf,

686
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,240
and he can be loved by the girl,

687
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,640
then you will be in big trouble.

688
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,040
Let's go.

689
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,560
Where are you going?

690
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,120
Feeling spirits Showing giddy dolls.

691
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,140
Don't miss it.

692
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
I'm leaving.

693
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Where are you going?

694
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Take Da Bing to experience the life of a noble.

695
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,140
Get in the car.

696
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
I'll drive you to the main road.

697
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,140
Where are you going?

698
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
Get in the car.

699
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,140
I'll drive you to the main road.

700
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Where are you going?

701
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Get in the car.

702
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
Didn't you just wash the car the day before yesterday?

703
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,140
Get in the car.

704
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,140
Put on your safety belt.

705
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,140
Don't run around. I'll see you later.

706
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,140
Hello, welcome.

707
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,140
Hello, I made an appointment today.

708
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
The phone is not working.

709
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,140
I'm sorry.

710
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
I'm sorry.

711
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,140
I'm sorry.

712
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
I'm sorry.

713
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
I'm sorry.

714
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,140
The phone number is 0305.

715
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
Okay, here.

716
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
Do you know how sad I am?

717
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
I have to rely on An Mi every night to sleep.

718
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
Can you...

719
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,140
I know you.

720
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,140
You're in the middle of the ZZX team, right?

721
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Yes.

722
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
I saw you at the flower bird market that day.

723
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,140
I was with Tai Long.

724
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
What's wrong with the kitten?

725
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,140
Maybe it's a cat.

726
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
It's too much for the body.

727
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,140
It's too much for the body.

728
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
I shouldn't have taken him to the cinema that day.

729
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
Tai Long didn't have time to take care of him.

730
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,140
So I took him to the hospital.

731
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
But I have to go to the company later to check.

732
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,140
Can you help me take care of him?

733
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
I'll pick him up in ten minutes.

734
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
I'll leave it to you.

735
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
I'll leave it to you.

736
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Come on.

737
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
If you didn't want to take care of him,

738
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
why did you buy it?

739
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
Miss.

740
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
Did you hear what Xu Tai Long said

741
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
on the live broadcast?

742
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
I heard it.

743
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Did you know?

744
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
I...

745
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,140
What's wrong, little kitten?

746
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
So fast?

747
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Why is Xu Tai Long's cat here?

748
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,140
I just met Xu Tai Long.

749
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Who is he?

750
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
He brought a kitten to the hospital.

751
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,140
He said he got a new cat fever.

752
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,140
But I think the result of the painting is obvious.

753
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
It's just a normal cold.

754
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Captain.

755
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
Captain.

756
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
The cat that's been brought to the hospital

757
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
is going to be banned.

758
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,140
What's the point of that?

759
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,140
I want to commit a crime.

760
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,140
You stole it.

761
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Be quiet.

762
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
The clerk heard it later

763
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,140
and thought I was really that kind of person.

764
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
This is already someone else's cat.

765
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
I know.

766
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,140
It's impossible to really steal it.

767
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,140
Your cat is already recovered.

768
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,140
You hate cats so much.

769
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
I'm leaving.

770
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
Smelly.

771
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
Thank you for taking care of him for me.

772
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Let's go.

773
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,140
He's not going to bring the cat back to the hospital, right?

774
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,140
Xu Tai Long's fans

775
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,140
should like that cat.

776
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,140
They should bring it back.

777
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,140
Don't tell me you're going to the airport.

778
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,140
Don't think too much.

779
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
Let's go.

780
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,200
Phone That According to theیں

781
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Yes.

782
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,140
Really.

783
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,720
In the afternoon, the staff took him to

784
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,140
この地方.

785
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,140
Bring me when he feels better.

786
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,140
The staff?

787
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,140
It's all right.

788
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,140
It's not aboutpoons.

789
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,180
Just vision with a cat.

790
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
Now he's very much better.

791
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,140
I want to see him off.

792
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,140
But

793
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
I'm going to fight some reli Licht Pickups in the afternoon.

794
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,140
Sixty weightpling fights you.

795
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,820
Say, who is that

796
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,140
I won't tell you.

797
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
A girlfriend?

798
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Yes, Jia Qi likes her too.

799
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
I raised her with her.

800
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
It's not as good as Li Heng said.

801
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
Good boy.

802
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,140
What's wrong? You hate her again?

803
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,140
Get away from me.

804
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,140
Don't blame me for live streaming.

805
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,140
Although I hate her,

806
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,140
she doesn't mind me watching her live streaming.

807
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
She's a liar.

808
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
She can lie to others.

809
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,140
It's so hard.

810
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,140
This is the textbook of living life.

811
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,140
It teaches us men in the power circle.

812
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
It's impossible.

813
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
What nonsense?

814
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,140
Men's mouth.

815
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
They're liars.

816
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
It's not good to be excited.

817
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
It's not good to be angry.

818
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
What do you mean?

819
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
I'm not good to be angry?

820
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Then blame me.

821
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Tell me.

822
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,140
There are several good men in the power circle.

823
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
They're good at playing games.

824
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,140
They're handsome and patient.

825
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,140
They don't lie to others.

826
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
There are.

827
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,140
Who?

828
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
Me.

829
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
Me?

830
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Do you want to try?

831
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
What are you talking about?

832
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
What's going on?

833
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,140
Just say it.

834
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,140
See if you can get it.

835
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,140
Is there any problem?

836
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,140
Can you say that casually?

837
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
Yes.

838
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,140
I can say it casually.

839
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,140
Do you think the captain is strange lately?

840
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,140
For example?

841
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,140
He's a man who has been out for a thousand years.

842
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,140
He's been out for a date.

843
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,140
Then he's been out for a while.

844
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,140
He's been out often.

845
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,140
He's even washed his car.

846
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,140
You said that.

847
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,140
The captain is really strange lately.

848
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,140
Right?

849
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Really?

850
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,140
Which part do you think is more strange?

851
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,140
The captain has been

852
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
drinking water lately.

853
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Okay.

854
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,140
The man in the mirror.

855
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
He He.

856
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,140
I want to have a drink.

857
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,140
Powder Be robotic

858
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Wow, there are噱 Vladöt breathers.

859
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,680
python heart

860
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,100
Shaveガfinder

861
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
Buy Buy Buy

862
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,860
loving

863
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,540
Who's in thisapp Bringing Light

864
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,180
Just rapport, right?

865
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,860
Today, the small untouched kitten

866
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,780
is happy.

867
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,220
It seems like having an Löser

868
00:32:50,220 --> 00:33:03,360
and you have some

869
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,600
No you don't,

870
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,700
I want you

871
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,460
I don't want you to go

872
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,500
Why is it black?

873
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,060
Is it black?

874
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,180
Who is the one who gave you the proof?

875
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,300
The proof?

876
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,500
Who else?

877
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,060
Of course, it's the one who gave you the proof.

878
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,260
How can it be?

879
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,900
Xu Tai Lun said in the live broadcast

880
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,860
that he and his girlfriend

881
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,820
had a good time.

882
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,260
If we love each other,

883
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
I don't know which time

884
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,500
he became the last straw in the world.

885
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,460
He was so angry.

886
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,540
He just sent a message

887
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,900
and sent a message to the public.

888
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,060
He just took it away.

889
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,900
Nice.

890
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,180
Why are you so gossipy?

891
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
He also said that the other teams

892
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,140
are bad at OBL and water bottle.

893
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,260
I think I was kicked out.

894
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,540
Last week,

895
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Mr. Fat was the one who

896
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,860
blew him up in the training match.

897
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,380
K also sent him the color of the match.

898
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,060
He told me that

899
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,460
he was bad at OBL and water bottle.

900
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,060
This is really hard to endure.

901
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,700
It's hard to endure.

902
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,660
There's another new report.

903
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,820
Go ahead.

904
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,780
I'm the staff of DQ5's team.

905
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,500
He He,

906
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,700
DQ5's team is originally

907
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,060
the Korean team.

908
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,020
His team is not familiar with the East.

909
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,820
When we played our ZGDX team last week,

910
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,100
we knew that

911
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,340
other teams couldn't beat him.

912
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,420
But we still did.

913
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,260
Why?

914
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,260
Because the water bottle

915
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,460
and the ZGDX team

916
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,860
didn't talk to him

917
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,860
about the movie.

918
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,020
Why are you so cruel?

919
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,820
It's not because

920
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,780
the team members of the club

921
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,300
are too much for him.

922
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,780
He thought that

923
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,820
the Chinese are all like this.

924
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,340
He's not used to

925
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
fighting against him alone.

926
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,020
Nonsense.

927
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,340
We can't just beat him to death.

928
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,740
OBL has good Korean.

929
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,980
The teaching,

930
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,700
the tea,

931
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,020
and the etiquette are good.

932
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,620
This is directly related

933
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,340
to the travel route of the club.

934
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,660
I think

935
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,780
no matter if it's the Chinese team or the Korean team,

936
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,580
you have to follow the rules

937
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,940
of the R2.

938
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,820
DQ5 is not bad in the spring game.

939
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,620
But it's just a line of talk.

940
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,540
From the moment

941
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,500
they started to take the lead

942
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,580
and came to the game,

943
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,420
it's over.

944
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,260
Now OBL

945
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,740
is like DQ5.

946
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,940
The club that can't control

947
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,940
the Korean team's team

948
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,660
is not just this family.

949
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,500
If this kind of OBL

950
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,820
is not changed,

951
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,860
OBL is really a real game.

952
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,060
Good night.

953
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,260
It's time to get used to it.

954
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,260
If the club

955
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,700
can reflect on the Korean problem,

956
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,300
then it might not

957
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,700
be time to change the subject.

958
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,660
This circle

959
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,700
should have been closed long ago.

960
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,940
I'm so afraid.

In the Observatory,

Xu Tai Leng利' s hands

968
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,140
will be seriously fragmented,

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,980
encounter

973
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,300
in the DQ5 players'.

974
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,340
Xu Tai Leng li'l

975
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,580
is a spontaneous

976
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,020
greatly affected the industry image of the electronic economy

977
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,940
and the social impact of the evil.

978
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,740
According to the OPL 30 rules,

979
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,580
the players should compete in a game

980
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,500
and pay 10,000 yuan.

981
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,620
At the same time, the club is not good at managing

982
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,100
and is limited to DQ5 club's serious warning

983
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
and pay 10,000 yuan.

984
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,620
Congratulations to our DQ5 team for winning.

985
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,420
Next, let's welcome their captain, Dragon,

986
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,420
to share his new performance.

987
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,420
It's a great honor for us to win this game.

988
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
And then,

989
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,420
I would like to thank my teammates.

990
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,420
I would also like to thank someone here.

991
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,420
It's because of him that our team

992
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,420
can slowly grow.

993
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
I also hope that this person can

994
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
accompany us and keep going.

995
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,420
You are so lucky.

996
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,420
You are so lucky.

997
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
You are so lucky.

998
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
You are so lucky.

999
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,420
Let's go, brothers.

1000
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,420
I'll treat you tonight.

1001
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,420
Let's go.

1002
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,420
Let's go.

1003
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,420
Let's go.

1004
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,420
Let's eat.

1005
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,420
Let's go.

1006
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
Do you like it?

1007
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,420
It's good.

1008
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,420
Can I have a photo with you?

1009
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,420
Please use my phone.

1010
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,420
Okay?

1011
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,420
Okay.

1012
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,420
Smile.

1013
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,420
Three, two, one.

1014
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
Okay.

1015
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,420
Show me.

1016
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
I'll send it to you next time.

1017
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,420
Then,

1018
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
eat the chili.

1019
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
Eat it.

1020
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
Okay.

1021
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
No.

1022
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
No.

1023
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,420
No.

1024
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
No.

1025
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
No.

1026
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,420
It's okay.

1027
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
It's okay.

1028
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,420
You're not happy.

1029
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
I'm not happy.

1030
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
You're not happy.

1031
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
No.

1032
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Okay?

1033
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,420
No.

1034
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,420
That's fine.

1035
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,420
I'm not happy.

1036
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,420
Okay?

1037
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Okay, okay?

1038
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,420
Okay.

1039
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,420
No.

1040
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,420
Okay.

1041
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
It's fine.

1042
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
He will never leave this week.

1043
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,100
He has to work on it until he's fully Green.

1044
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,860
Don't show it blamed her.

1045
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:17,980
Good bye.

1046
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,620
Be a good boy!

1047
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,700
Miss Meng'er, thank you.

1048
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,420
Thank you.

1049
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:38,060
It's all prepared.

1050
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,620
Will you go and have a sit inside?

1051
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,940
Not yet.

1052
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,500
Xu Tai Ling is interested in that matter...

1053
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,300
Okay.

1054
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,380
I'll go buy some food first.

1055
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,100
I'll be back in a while.

1056
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,740
Okay.

1057
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,820
I'll give you the umbrella.

1058
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,340
Okay.

1059
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,020
Thank you.

1060
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,020
detoxify

1061
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,700
liches

1062
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,100
Take it easy.

1063
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
I just wanted to look at him from afar.

1064
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
I wanted to be friends with him.

1065
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,100
I started to be shy and picky.

1066
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,900
I couldn't get the chance to be friends with him.

1067
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
I was the one who got him.

1068
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,700
If it had been so, why did you have to go out?

1069
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,900
Brother Cheng, why are you here?

1070
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,100
The interview was suddenly turned into a double interview.

1071
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
I came at once.

1072
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,900
Why did they not give you the money?

1073
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
I gave it to them.

1074
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,700
I had an accident.

1075
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,900
I gave the umbrella to someone else.

1076
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,900
Where are the interviewers?

1077
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,900
They are not here yet.

1078
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,900
I saw some fans at the door.

1079
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,300
They looked at the fans.

1080
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,900
They were so upset.

1081
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,300
Why did they come?

1082
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
What were they searching for?

1083
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,900
The heroes in their hearts?

1084
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,900
Or the people they designed?

1085
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,900
Actually, those people on the stage

1086
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,300
are not as great as they thought.

1087
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,700
Some of them may even be worse than themselves.

1088
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,100
What's wrong?

1089
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,500
I should have told you that.

1090
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,100
I saw that girl just now.

1091
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,300
It was Xu Tai Lun.

1092
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,100
I hated him at first.

1093
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,900
But now I think

1094
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,300
he has been a fan of his while he was hating.

1095
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,700
Fans always like to think about the people they like.

1096
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,700
Whether it's Xu Tai Lun or us.

1097
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,900
But the feeling of loving yourself

1098
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,500
is what they want to do.

1099
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,500
They are exposed and destroyed.

1100
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
When I think about it,

1101
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,700
I think that this circle of ours

1102
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,500
may not be liked by others.

1103
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,300
You think so highly of yourself.

1104
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,100
At least our teammates did a good job.

1105
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,100
One or two of them are in the base all day.

1106
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,500
They almost took ZJDX as a box.

1107
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,500
One or two of them can't be recognized by the media.

1108
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,100
It's unfair.

1109
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,500
I've reminded you.

1110
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm a good person.

1111
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,300
But your idea now makes me feel worried.

1112
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Worry?

1113
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,700
Before I can say it,

1114
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,300
you should be disappointed by this circle.

1115
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
That's a problem.

1116
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,300
There are still many good men in this circle.

1117
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,700
They are rich and handsome.

1118
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,900
They are good at playing games and not good at sleeping.

1119
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,700
They treat the base as a box.

1120
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
They almost read the news every day.

1121
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,300
Who?

1122
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,300
I.

1123
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,300
So,

1124
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,700
I'll ask you one more question.

1125
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,900
Do you want to try it?

1126
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,900
What?

1127
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
Me.

1128
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,900
You said you'll always be by my side.

1129
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
You left a message to me.

1130
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,900
I'm waiting for you.

1131
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,900
Now I know how long the future will last.

1132
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:59,300
You don't need to have the passion.

1133
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,700
I want to get close to you.

1134
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,100
A little bit closer.

1135
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,500
One moment without expression.

1136
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,900
Calm down.

1137
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,300
The heartbeat is always the best proof.

1138
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,500
From the road to the sky, the clouds are shining.

1139
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,300
The world is only me and you.

1140
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,700
The first silence.

1141
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,100
You laugh at my breath.

1142
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,500
I also want to be with you.

1143
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,500
I want to get close to you.

1144
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,900
A little bit closer.

1145
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,500
One moment without expression.

1146
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Calm down.

1147
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,100
The heartbeat is always the best proof.

1148
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,500
From the road to the sky, the clouds are shining.

1149
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,300
The world is only me and you.

1150
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
The first silence.

1151
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,100
You laugh at my breath.

1152
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,500
I also want to be with you.

1153
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,500
From the road to the sky, the clouds are shining.

1154
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,500
The world is only me and you.

1155
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,700
The first silence.

1156
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,300
You laugh at my breath.

1157
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,300
I also want to be with you.
