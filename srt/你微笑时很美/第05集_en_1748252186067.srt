00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:27,080
I'll ask Mr. Lu Sicheng to pay the הגb

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,840
Stay here

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,040

Mom

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,280
Where is the Chiziman?

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,960
With Chiziman in her Master's Maid?

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,320
Could she be interested?

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,880
Uncle and Auntie,

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,320
I forgot to introduce myself,

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,380
I have a name,

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,240
Chiziman.

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,320

Come.

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,280
Good morning, Aunt Shu Shu.

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,800
Good morning.

63
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
We've prepared a great breakfast.

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
I don't know how Aunt Shu Shu's taste is.

65
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,400
So I bought everything.

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,320
There are porridge,

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,240
fried tofu,

68
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,880
soy milk,

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,400

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
and panini.

71
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,320
You can pick whatever you like.

72
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,840
This is so great.

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's eat together.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,320
We've already eaten.

75
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Aunt Shu Shu, please enjoy.

76
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,440
Okay.

77
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,320
Thank you.

78
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,400
Good morning, Aunt Shu Shu.

79
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,640
Hello.

80
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,440
My name is Han Mei Mei.

81
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,440
Good morning.

82
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
Good morning.

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
How do you do?

84
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,800
Good morning, Aunt Shu Shu.

85
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,680
Good morning.

86
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
We prepared a great breakfast for you.

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Good morning, Aunt Shu Shu.

88
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Good morning.

89
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay.

90
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,120
Let's find a time to have a meal with him.

91
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,760
Okay.

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
Dad, mom.

93
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,760
Wait a minute.

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,520
I called Liang Dili to the car.

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
I think he'll arrive soon.

96
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,640
What car?

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
We'll stop by the roadside.

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
That's enough.

99
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,800
That's right.

100
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,080
There are plenty of places to spend money.

101
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Save some money.

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,560
It's okay.

103
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,040
It's inconvenient to stop by here.

104
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,400
It's convenient to use the ladder.

105
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,640
You can use your fingers.

106
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,480
Yao Yao, mom, tell you what.

107
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,920
It's a bit crowded here.

108
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,320
When I came here last night,

109
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,600
I didn't see anyone.

110
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,840
If you go out at night,

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,120
you must find someone to accompany you.

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,240
Don't go out alone.

113
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,600
Mom, I'm not a kid.

114
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,320
I can take care of myself.

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
Besides, we're all teammates.

116
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
We're almost there.

117
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
We don't have to be alone.

118
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,680
If you really want to go out,

119
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,320
you can call Chesman to accompany you.

120
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Brother Cheng?

121
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,440
Forget it.

122
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,440
His name is Lu Si Cheng.

123
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,080
What do you do at home?

124
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,040
I think he's doing business.

125
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,200
Mom, look at him.

126
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,920
His family is pretty good.

127
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,160
He's quite polite.

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,400
Is he a student?

129
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,680
Is that so?

130
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
Here he is.

131
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,040
Hello.

132
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,600
Hello.

133
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,960
I'm here to serve you.

134
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,760
Please ask me

135
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
if you're a student of the 0305.

136
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,960
Yes, I'm a student of the high school.

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,120
Okay, I'll help you.

138
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,080
No need.

139
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,040
I'll do it myself.

140
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,640
I'll do it myself.

141
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,040
Okay.

142
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,880
You can take a rest.

143
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,680
Thank you.

144
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
Where is he?

145
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
He's a student of the high school.

146
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
He's a student of the high school.

147
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,160
He's a student of the high school.

148
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,840
I know that.

149
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,080
Mom, what are you doing?

150
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,160
Do you want me to show you

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,040
his passport?

152
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,720
You have his passport?

153
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
Get in the car.

154
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay, let's go.

155
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,720
Come on, please get in.

156
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
Be careful.

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,960
Please take care of your health.

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,720
Mom,

159
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,600
be safe.

160
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
Send me a message when you get home.

161
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,160
Okay.

162
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,880
I got it.

163
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,800
Don't worry.

164
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,200
Yao Yao,

165
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,800
you're doing well.

166
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Good luck.

167
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,040
Enjoy your meal.

168
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,720
Bye.

169
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,760
Bye.

170
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Bye.

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,840
Let's go.

172
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
The meeting is over.

173
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,680
Today, we're going to talk about

174
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,840
the four-packed clothes system.

175
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
According to the traditional definition,

176
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,840
the four-packed clothes is...

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,120
Sorry.

178
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,640
Wait a minute.

179
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,120
Wait a minute.

180
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,240
I'll get a package.

181
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
Let's wait and see.

182
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,080
Doctor,

183
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,000
look here.

184
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
There's something wrong.

185
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
Tong Yao,

186
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,680
these are all your fans' clothes.

187
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,800
They're so nice to you.

188
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
They're all your food.

189
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,600
These two items are so nice.

190
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,960
The packaging is so delicate.

191
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,720
Miss,

192
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,440
your fans' taste is good.

193
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
What's this?

194
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,280
Miss,

195
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,640
you have fans?

196
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,760
My dear Yao Yao,

197
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,400
I don't know how you've been

198
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,040
these days.

199
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,520
Are you happy?

200
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,160
You...

201
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,400
In 24 hours,

202
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
do you have

203
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,600
a minute to think about it?

204
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,040
Who's the place

205
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,720
that's so bright?

206
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,520
Sunflower.

207
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,320
Jian Yang.

208
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,720
All the names in the future

209
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
will be removed.

210
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,000
No.

211
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,560
It's not good.

212
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,360
Everyone, be careful.

213
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,040
I think

214
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,760
the weather is very good this morning.

215
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,840
The department of Zhengqiao District

216
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,120
has just passed

217
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,920
the new team member schedule

218
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,400
that I've mentioned.

219
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,080
Let's start.

220
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,760
That means

221
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
from tomorrow,

222
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,840
you can't sleep and sleep.

223
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,200
How many hours of training?

224
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,440
Nine.

225
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,080
Nine?

226
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,240
You can't sleep

227
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,280
at 8 o'clock.

228
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,080
Children can sleep early.

229
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,200
What do you two want?

230
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,440
Yes.

231
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,960
I want to sleep and sleep.

232
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Let's continue.

233
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,000
Their tactics

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,160
are comparable to ours.

235
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
If their list

236
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,280
is the main type of

237
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,360
leading role in the lead role,

238
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,720
then I think

239
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,640
AD and Zhong Dan's role

240
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,680
are more important.

241
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,920
Haha.

242
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,080
Okay.

243
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,800
I'll super your target.

244
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,320
Please.

245
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,880
그럼 Tschu losses

246
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,560
1-1.

247
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,480
Okay.

248
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
Wasn't that good.

249
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,440
?

250
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,480
Everyoneаго.

251
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,060
Commit self- independence training.

252
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,640
See you.

253
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,280
See you.

254
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,720
See you.

255
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,240
Un Kitty.

256
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,920
Disturbing.

257
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,880
We should work with 1-1 attitude according to her opinion.

258
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,480
We should compare

259
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,440
to our result.

260
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,880
breakfast

261
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,040
Time to get up

262
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,600
Time to get up

263
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,680
Get up and practice

264
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,960
I have Siberianense

265
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,040
Sorry, I can't control you

266
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,080
Ray, you are not a hero

267
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,800
Get up

268
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
Get up

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,280

270
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:44,040
instantly easily suspectable and

271
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,960
flawless from mind when.

272
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,640
An air-conditioner is always

273
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,760
good to take care of a nuet.

274
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,520
It's no occurance

275
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,560
to alertear these figures%.

276
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,480
If moimans come here

277
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,920
to scan their

278
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,280
DNA

279
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
these."

280
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,960
Well,

281
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Okay, since it's the first day,

282
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
we must turn on the switch.

283
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Wait for Wei Wei to go out.

284
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Come on, turn on the switch.

285
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Hands.

286
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Legs.

287
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Yeah.

288
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
It's almost done.

289
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Are you ready?

290
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Ready.

291
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Then let's do a slow run first.

292
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Are you ready?

293
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Ready.

294
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Ready.

295
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Ready.

296
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Come on.

297
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
No.

298
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Run.

299
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Didn't you say slow run?

300
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Don't look.

301
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Go. Go.

302
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Follow him. Follow him.

303
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I'm so hungry.

304
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Where did you get it?

305
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
It's so hot.

306
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
You're so cute.

307
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
You're so cute.

308
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
I can't touch you.

309
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Lu Si Cheng.

310
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
So hot.

311
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
So talented.

312
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Sir.

313
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Can you tell me

314
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
if you're capable of training?

315
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
You're obviously capable of doing it.

316
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Who's begging for Cheng Ge to stop doing it?

317
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
What's the sound?

318
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
What's the smell?

319
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Cheng Ge.

320
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Sir.

321
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm on live.

322
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
The whole world can see it.

323
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
The whole world can see it.

324
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
The whole world can see it.

325
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
The whole world can see it.

326
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
The whole world can see it.

327
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
What are you doing?

328
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm busy.

329
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm on live.

330
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm looking for...

331
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Is it Xiaorui?

332
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Is it Xiaorui?

333
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
The one who wears a camera

334
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
with a big smile on it

335
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
will be seen sooner or later.

336
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
That makes sense.

337
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Do you agree?

338
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
No.

339
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
You signed the contract.

340
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
You'll see

341
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
what's better.

342
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
This camera

343
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
doesn't match my heart.

344
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Didn't you buy

345
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
a camera?

346
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Go.

347
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Remember the live broadcast.

348
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
45 hours

349
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
is not the end of the month.

350
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
It's a long time.

351
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
When the cook arrives,

352
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
you find someone to tie Xiaorui up.

353
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Otherwise, he'll still

354
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
finish your contract

355
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
without any mercy.

356
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
I bought it.

357
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
It's a good deal.

358
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Cheng Ge's voice is so good.

359
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
I'm so happy.

360
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
He's so kind.

361
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
He's so good.

362
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
He's so good.

363
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
It's a good deal.

364
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Let's see the voice of the crowd.

365
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Tong Yao.

366
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
It seems you have to

367
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
start the live broadcast.

368
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Okay.

369
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
But give me some time.

370
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I need to prepare.

371
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
What do you need to prepare?

372
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Just a live broadcast.

373
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
You're going to prepare

374
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
the voice acting

375
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
according to the role of the queen of the three families.

376
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Brother Rui,

377
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
don't care about it.

378
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Okay.

379
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
I'll send you.

380
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm off to work.

381
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Hello, I'm looking for...

382
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Hello, I'm looking for Tong Yao.

383
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Hello, sister.

384
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
The world is so beautiful.

385
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I'm so happy to see you.

386
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm so happy to see you.

387
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm so happy to see you.

388
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm so happy to see you.

389
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Okay.

390
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Hello, sister.

391
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Close the door.

392
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Okay.

393
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
What are you hiding from me?

394
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Why do I feel

395
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
you're pulling my eyes up?

396
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Sister, look at yourself.

397
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
You even have black circles.

398
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
How could you face

399
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Gao Qingsheng's test?

400
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Sister,

401
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
your night training

402
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
is dry.

403
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
I can't come to your makeup

404
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
every time.

405
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
I'll save money

406
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
for the next live broadcast.

407
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Remember,

408
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
every day,

409
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
you'll have a small face mask.

410
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Don't get wet.

411
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Yes, yes.

412
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I'm very proud of you.

413
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
It's almost the same.

414
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I saw Brother Rui in the building.

415
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
He's really a good guy.

416
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
I didn't expect you two

417
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
to be so quick to make a scene.

418
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
What scene?

419
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Don't be ridiculous.

420
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Why do you call me a fool?

421
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm used to

422
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
turning into a computer white-haired

423
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
when I came back from abroad.

424
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Don't mention the past.

425
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
What?

426
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Jian Yang is still in the past?

427
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
The place where the sun rises

428
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
is the world again.

429
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Don't laugh.

430
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Did you get married just now?

431
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Why should I be good to her?

432
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
If I didn't come

433
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
to draw a dance with you,

434
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
if you want to

435
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
stay abroad with Ai Jia,

436
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
you should tell her directly.

437
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
How do you know

438
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
she doesn't want to?

439
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Does she listen to me sometimes?

440
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
She's always on the phone.

441
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
I know she must

442
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
not like her drama.

443
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Even if she's a little bit

444
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
more into the water now,

445
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
she can fight for her whole life.

446
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
And she's hiding in the room

447
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
like a vampire every day.

448
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Who's like a vampire?

449
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Even if you're a poet,

450
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
you're also a cute vampire.

451
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Is that okay?

452
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Yes.

453
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
But what are you going to do now?

454
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Since you've rejected

455
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
the offer of abroad,

456
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
you should find a job in China now.

457
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
I remember

458
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
when you were in college,

459
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
you didn't do the job

460
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
of a manager.

461
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I was doing it for Ai Jia.

462
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I don't want to

463
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
go through this.

464
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
But

465
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
there's really someone

466
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
who wants me to be a director

467
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
for a national competition.

468
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
National competition?

469
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Isn't that the competition

470
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm going to attend?

471
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
You agreed?

472
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I'm still considering.

473
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Change your glasses.

474
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Close your eyes.

475
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Your Smelling Miss is here.

476
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
What are you hiding?

477
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Headband, iron ball.

478
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
I'm not using

479
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
the face you drew

480
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
to treat the floor.

481
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
That's right, Miss.

482
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Why are you

483
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
looking so handsome?

484
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
You have a good lipstick color.

485
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
What brand is it?

486
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Lipstick?

487
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Did she paint her lipstick?

488
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
How can I not see it?

489
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
It's a natural color.

490
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
It's not red or red.

491
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
It's a light white color.

492
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Go to the government world

493
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
of your sister.

494
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm done.

495
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Miss, I'll send you a gift.

496
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
I'll open the door for you.

497
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Miss.

498
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
You look pretty.

499
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
You're looking at me.

500
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Come on.

501
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Get on.

502
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
I'm drooling.

504
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960

Okay, okay.

Okay, okay.

Okay, okay.

Miss.

514
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
What's wrong?

515
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Miss.

516
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960

they are over ten million every ten thousand ten or ten thousand

535
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,880

There are so many.

537
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,560
How about延 Moorecourt account算了吧?

538
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,760
It's okay.

539
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
The average platform is said to be very public with a net market of only cré Audi waiting for two or three million.

540
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,960
I'll sue anyone later I draw for you anymore.

Okay.

Look at her.

She's really a woman.

564
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
She's a noble.

565
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760

That's the famous star.

The top-ranked star in the industry.

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760

581
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
with a little student.

582
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm going to report to the CGDX team

583
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
for the same result.

584
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
You look the highest

585
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
and the highest.

586
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
You're over one to six.

587
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Look at the student's job.

588
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Why are you so busy?

589
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4.

590
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Lu Si Cheng.

591
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
What are you doing?

592
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Nian Dan Mu is live.

593
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Pay attention to the civilization.

594
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Don't be ridiculous.

595
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
I didn't say anything.

596
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Besides,

597
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Xiaopang is telling the truth every day.

598
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
No.

599
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
He's gone.

600
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Come on.

601
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Why are you suddenly calling me?

602
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Don't be so mean.

603
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Don't be so heartless.

604
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Don't be sad.

605
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
No.

606
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Who's being mean?

607
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
It's Brother Cheng.

608
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Yes, it's me.

609
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
My wife is not Zhou Yueshen.

610
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
It's Smelly.

611
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
You probably need to go to see the eye doctor.

612
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
If you have a brain,

613
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
I recommend you to go there.

614
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
What is he doing?

615
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Smelly.

616
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
You look so pretty.

617
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
So pretty.

618
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
So pretty.

619
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
So pretty.

620
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
How about we have a cool meal in the toilet?

621
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Do you have fun with Nian Dan Mu?

622
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Yes.

623
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Smelly is so busy.

624
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
Why is the game so fierce?

625
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
My heart is full of anger.

626
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm so tired.

627
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
When are you going to be tired?

628
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
When I'm tired.

629
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Can you adjust the height and height?

630
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
You're sitting there and doing it so late.

631
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Can you adjust the height and height?

632
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Don't just have a brain.

633
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Do you think it's useful for you?

634
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Do you think it's useful for you?

635
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Congratulations.

636
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
You're so talented.

637
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Xiaorui.

638
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Did you buy the black and white for Tong Yang?

639
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
How would I know?

640
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
You look so cute.

641
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Of course.

642
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
You look cute in the group photo.

643
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
You're the first one to come up.

644
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Didn't you use to play the game?

645
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
You believed in me?

646
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
What's your relationship with my husband?

647
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Who is your husband?

648
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Tell him to come over and talk to me.

649
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Your brother is still in the game.

650
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
How old is he?

651
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
I asked him to give me a big one.

652
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Who bought him a box of medicine?

653
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
I donated a dollar.

654
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Did you see my account?

655
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
I just gave you a big one.

656
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Don't be ridiculous.

657
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
The hotel is working.

658
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
This person is crazy.

659
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Let's stop here today.

660
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
The main broadcast is not happy.

661
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
We have to go to drink some yogurt.

662
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Child, you'll send your brand of food every year.

663
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
Send it to Xiaopang.

664
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I...

665
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Du Si Cheng, are you going to eat the duck?

666
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
I really bought a brand of food every year.

667
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Sisi.

668
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Miss, I'm going to give you a heavy one.

669
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Du Si Cheng.

670
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Miss, you're so fierce.

671
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Two, three, three.

672
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Three, three, three.

673
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Three, three, three.

674
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Three, three, three.

675
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Brother Cheng,

676
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
your old colleague, TAT,

677
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
came to the training camp.

678
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Not now.

679
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
I think Tong Yao is quite active now.

680
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
And she has been doing well in the training camp recently.

681
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
But I...

682
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
No.

683
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Tong Yao needs to train for a while.

684
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
We'll talk about it later.

685
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Okay.

686
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
You're the captain.

687
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
It's your turn.

688
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Brother Cheng.

689
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Take it out.

690
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
It's a pure wooden box.

691
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Then it's okay.

692
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
And...

693
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
And...

694
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Master Lu,

695
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
you can't eat it.

696
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Master,

697
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,760
you're a new member of the TAT team.

698
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Congratulations on your winning the championship.

699
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Can you tell us about the future?

700
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Of course, it's a difficult world championship.

701
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Last season,

702
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
we won the championship

703
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
in the final of the competition.

704
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Then,

705
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
do you have any players

706
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
who are looking forward to the competition?

707
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Our team

708
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,760
has sent a lot of people to the other team.

709
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,760
They are all very talented,

710
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
but they are still

711
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,760
a rookie in the Korean game industry.

712
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,760
So I'm not afraid of them.

713
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
Recently,

714
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
there are some girls

715
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
who are interested in the game.

716
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,760
I heard that the atmosphere of the Chinese game industry

717
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
is different from ours.

718
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
But they are more popular

719
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
than the game industry.

720
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,760
They are very important.

721
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
They are not talented,

722
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
so they are not even

723
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,760
a big part of the game.

724
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
In the TAT team,

725
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,760
you are the first player to be promoted to the top in the game.

726
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
You must be afraid of them.

727
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
You must be afraid of them.

728
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
How can I say it in Chinese?

729
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,760
The leader of the TAT team is Wu Gui.

730
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
This TAT team is not very good.

731
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
I guess Miao Lin

732
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
knows how good he is.

733
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
The result is good.

734
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
The whole team

735
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
is in the TAT team.

736
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
The team is very considerate.

737
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
The training of the TAT team

738
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
is coming up.

739
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
What are you waiting for?

740
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Right.

741
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
But Brother Cheng...

742
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
It's decided.

743
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I'll respond to the management.

744
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Roger.

745
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
ZGDX is really good.

746
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
No way.

747
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Xiao Cheng,

748
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
hurry up and take his salary.

749
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
I said

750
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
it's not the time to train with TAT.

751
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
But they have made a public challenge.

752
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
And they have been training for so long.

753
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Tong Yao,

754
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
she should be able to adapt.

755
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Why are we so worried?

756
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,760
We heard the wind.

757
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Now the club

758
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
is talking about

759
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
the whole world about our new

760
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
single training match.

761
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Imagine that Han Guo is so powerful.

762
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Let's find his team.

763
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Why must we respond to the TAT?

764
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
This is the decision of the club's general manager.

765
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
I can't resist it.

766
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
The public debate is now about

767
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
ZGDX's team is the leader of the TAT team.

768
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
We can't really be the leader of the TAT team.

769
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
And we can lose the game.

770
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
The new game starts.

771
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
The two teams

772
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
are very good at fighting each other.

773
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
They are going to fight with TAT.

774
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
It's different.

775
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
If we lose, we will lose.

776
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
The club is running out of time.

777
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
And we have to

778
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
get the TAT.

779
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Whatever.

780
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
If anything happens,

781
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
don't ask me to help you.

782
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
You are so protective of him.

783
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
You are so smart.

784
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
You were on the internet

785
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
when you were on the TV show.

786
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
The club has come to me.

787
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
I just got tired of it.

788
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
You don't even

789
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
let me fight in the training match.

790
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
It's so weird.

791
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
You know that

792
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
before the game,

793
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
we had a training match

794
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
and we got the TAT.

795
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,760
It must be higher than the level of the national team.

796
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
And what happened to the game?

797
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
The confidence was broken.

798
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
I really don't understand.

799
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Lu Si Cheng.

800
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
You really like Tong Yao?

801
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
How come I don't know

802
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
you like the grass outside?

803
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
I won't take your question.

804
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
I can't believe

805
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
what you said.

806
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
So,

807
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
you are so protective of him

808
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
because he is a girl.

809
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
I think he is

810
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
not easy to get to today.

811
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm afraid he will be eliminated

812
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
if he loses the game.

813
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Xia Ru.

814
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
If I heard you say that,

815
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
I would jump down

816
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
and hit your head.

817
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
When can he get over this?

818
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
I didn't see him as a girl.

819
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
So I didn't have sympathy

820
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
and pity.

821
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
I didn't think

822
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
he was easy to get to today.

823
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
I treated him

824
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
as a new person

825
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
and made him

826
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
know the importance of professional economy.

827
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
He just joined the team.

828
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
He has everything

829
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
in this circle.

830
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
He is like him.

831
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
He only wants to play the game

832
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
and get good results.

833
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
He is so hard to find.

834
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
So I don't want him

835
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
to be defeated

836
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
by the security guard.

837
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
But he is

838
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
forced to do something

839
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
to avoid it.

840
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
I...

841
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,760
I'm a little confused.

842
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Tai.

843
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
When I was in the TIT team,

844
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
he was a famous hero.

845
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
He said that

846
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
he was not

847
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
a hero because he was strong

848
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
and confident.

849
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
But he is like

850
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
a mid-term picker

851
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
who doesn't stay on the side.

852
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
In the TIT team,

853
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
he wanted to make new people.

854
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Only the mid-term picker

855
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
was behind the training after the match with Tai.

856
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
He didn't give up

857
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
his career

858
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
just because he was

859
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
in the TIT team.

860
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
There are many teams

861
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
who refuse to

862
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
train with TIT.

863
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
That's the reason.

864
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
He also looks at the enemy's eyes

865
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
and tries to force the team.

866
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
In his eyes,

867
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
the training

868
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
is not a basic training.

869
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
It's his ability

870
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
to control the enemy's strength.

871
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Can he fight with him?

872
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Sometimes,

873
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
I think if he doesn't

874
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
work hard,

875
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
he will be

876
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
a good player

877
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
in other industries.

878
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Do you know

879
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
the Star Team

880
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
who was once called

881
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
the famous team?

882
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
I know.

883
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
They were really good

884
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
at that time.

885
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
The champion came

886
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
and the game company

887
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
specially gave them

888
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
a new year's resolution.

889
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
This year,

890
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
they won the game.

891
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
But they have already retired.

892
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
In the spring season,

893
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
they won the spring season final.

894
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
A Tai used this skin

895
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
to pass the mid-way

896
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
and send it to the enemy.

897
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
That's what A Tai did.

898
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
This time, the enemy is very clear.

899
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
The team that was recently bought by them

900
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
is very good at

901
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
fighting with the team.

902
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
What do you think?

903
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Tong Yao is a newbie.

904
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
The team that was just

905
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
trained well

906
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
and has good vision.

907
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
She is very confident

908
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
in her play.

909
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
She is a good player.

910
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
She is a good player.

911
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Why does she

912
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
think she is a good player?

913
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
She will be a great player.

914
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
I am a good player.

915
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
If this kid

916
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
is a bad player,

917
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
he will be broken

918
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
soon

919
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
because I don't agree with

920
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
the club

921
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
and ask her to compete with him.

922
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Brother Cheng,

923
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,760
A Tai came to our training

924
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
and will do these things to Tong Yao.

925
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
He will defeat Tong Yao

926
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
with early-game money.

927
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
This is his good game.

928
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
He likes to defeat the opponent

929
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
with his hand,

930
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
so he will defeat the opponent with a grudge.

931
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
But Tong Yao is the first person

932
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
to defeat early-game money.

933
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
He may not lose.

934
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
He is the one who came with the name.

935
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
He wants everyone to know

936
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,760
that

937
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
he is a good player.

938
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
He is a good player.

939
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
He is a good player.

940
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
He is a good player.

941
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
I think

942
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
he is a good player.

943
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
He is a good player.

944
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
He is a good player.

945
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
He wants everyone to know

946
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
that he is the world's first player to defeat early-game money.

947
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
I am wrong.

948
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
I should compete with

949
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
the club.

950
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
I have to protect Tong Yao.

951
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
I told you that you would apologize.

952
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
It's not the time to say this.

953
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
What should I do now?

954
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Should I go to the training camp?

955
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Brother Cheng said it was not right.

956
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,760
Tong Yao is going to beat Tong Yao.

957
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
It is indeed not right to beat Tong Yao now.

958
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
But Guan Wei has replied.

959
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
He can't turn back.

960
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
But it's too bad

961
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
to be beaten by Ma Su Tou.

962
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
It's too bad.

963
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Wei is also a difficult one.

964
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
I have to tell Tong Yao.

965
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
No.

966
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Brother Su.

967
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Brother Cheng.

968
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
What's wrong?

969
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
It's too difficult for him.

970
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Is it good?

971
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
I didn't mean it.

972
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
I said

973
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
I didn't hear anything.

974
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Do you believe me?

975
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
How long have you heard it?

976
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
I didn't.

977
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Just a little bit.

978
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
You said I was good at it.

979
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
I was good at it.

980
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
I was a good watcher.

981
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
It's hard to find it when I hit the light.

982
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,760
You also said I was a gem.

983
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
What?

984
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
So is it true?

985
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
You said I was a gem.

986
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
I have been your teammate for so many years.

987
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
I haven't seen you in the club for more than five years.

988
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
You are the only one in the club.

989
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
Thank you.

990
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Thank you.

991
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
What's wrong?

992
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
You two are so close.

993
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
You are so close.

994
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
You didn't say anything.

995
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
You just kept the light on.

996
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Ice, wear, smile.

997
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Fire, tree, bloom.

998
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Cry, wind, dust.

999
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
A bunch of fingers.

1000
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
You are right.

1001
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Since you heard it,

1002
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
we won't hide it from you.

1003
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
You are the one who got 99% of the money.

1004
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
There is a cow in the car.

1005
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,760
I don't want you to be fired because you just signed the contract.

1006
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
After all, you are my first-time judge.

1007
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
I haven't got the championship yet.

1008
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
How can I be fired?

1009
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
You can still get the championship if you refuse now.

1010
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Although you are a good watcher,

1011
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
it's useful.

1012
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
I'll go to the club to discuss it with you.

1013
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
No, Rui, don't go.

1014
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
I will be the beauty of the sky.

1015
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Since we will face each other one day,

1016
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
we can't solve any problems.

1017
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
If we lose now,

1018
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,760
we will be stronger than when we lose at the competition.

1019
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Moreover,

1020
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
even if he makes a mistake,

1021
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
I can win.

1022
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
You are so optimistic.

1023
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Let's go.

1024
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,760
sweise

1025
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,760
materialistic

1026
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,920
people

1027
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
now r trois Don't want to leave me.

1028
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
It's okay. I can rely on the flower.

1029
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
OK, then remove the groom.

1030
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
Stop.

1031
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,600
Okay.

1032
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,280
The peace and quiet change is real.

1033
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,200
They really chose the bathhouse.

1034
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,520
How bold.

1035
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,120
Tong Yang,

1036
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,680
A-Tai came for you.

1037
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,320
If you want to take the bathhouse,

1038
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,440
you must be careful of the rain.

1039
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,160
You can't touch the shadow of the bathhouse with him.

1040
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,280
I know.

1041
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,000
Captain,

1042
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,760
Call Fullục.

1043
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,480
So excellent.

1044
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,240
It's okay.

1045
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,960
You can take Long Zhou Lay.

1046
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
It's okay. Don't worry.

1047
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Xiaopan, fight with me for the master.

1048
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Okay.

1049
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Old K comes up to the tower to protect Old Cat.

1050
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
Be careful of the position you are in.

1051
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
Be careful of the position you are in.

1052
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Don't fight with him.

1053
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Old K, help.

1054
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Coming.

1055
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Old K, help.

1056
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Old K, help.

1057
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Don't move.

1058
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Retreat.

1059
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
I can't get into the tower.

1060
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
I can't get into the tower.

1061
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
I can't get into the tower.

1062
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Xiaoxian, hold on.

1063
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
I can't get into the tower.

1064
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
I can't get into the tower.

1065
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Just a training match.

1066
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Xiaoxian, it's okay.

1067
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,760
It's just that Old K has been fighting for you.

1068
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
I'm fine.

1069
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
I'm really fine.

1070
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
It's normal to have a game.

1071
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,760
You can win the game again in the afternoon.

1072
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
You made me think too much.

1073
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I'm really fine.

1074
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
You are...

1075
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
It's getting late.

1076
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
He needs to rest.

1077
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Who can't get up tomorrow?

1078
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
I need to hurry up.

1079
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Let's go to bed.

1080
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Yes, go to bed.

1081
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
Go to bed.

1082
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
I'm sleepy.

1083
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Let's go.

1084
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Let's go.

1085
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Let's go to bed.

1086
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Go to bed.

1087
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Good night.

1088
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Miss Mei, it's time to sleep.

1089
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
I'll go to bed after I finish this.

1090
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
I'm going to bed.

1091
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
I'm going to bed.

1092
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
I'm going to bed.

1093
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
I'm going to bed.

1094
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,760
I'm going to bed.

1095
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
I'm going to bed.

1096
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
I'm going to bed.
