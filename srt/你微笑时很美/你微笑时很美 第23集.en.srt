1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,830
I'm not

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,600
exactly young in this industry.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,230
I've been a professional player for many years,

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,630
and I've seen quite a lot.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,290
So,

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,020
when it comes to players dating,

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,080
you're not actually opposed, right?

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,110
As long as it's within reason,

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,110
I won't oppose it.

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,780
I've heard of legendary stories where both the man and woman

11
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,190
get admitted to Tsinghua or Peking University.

12
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,250
Cheng, do you want to be like that too?

13
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,920
I already have someone I like.

14
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,900
Cheng has someone he likes?

15
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,580
How come it hasn't been leaked in the esports industry?

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,040
Finally, there's something you don't know.

17
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,350
[Falling into your smile]

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,039
[Episode 23]

19
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,880
I know shipping is not the right thing to do,

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,140
but I still want to say this.

21
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,140
When Cheng said the last sentence,

22
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,759
he put his right hand under the table.

23
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,289
At that time, Tong Yao's hand was also under the table.

24
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,830
Cheng's arm moved slightly.

25
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,550
So, what did you two do?

26
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,539
I already have someone I like.

27
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,940
What's wrong?

28
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,960
Are you shy?

29
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,920
Look at this.

30
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,030
Look at Cheng's arm.

31
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,380
I bet they held hands.

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,110
Impressive.

33
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,440
What kind of reaction is that?

34
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,480
She's so observant. She almost found it out.

35
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,500
Hey.

36
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,070
Why are you so nervous?

37
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,220
I've been shipping them since The Legend of the White Snake.

38
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,079
No way!

39
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,750
Cheng would never fall for her.

40
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,210
She's just a cheap girl in the esports industry.

41
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,320
Does Cheng want to give up on himself?

42
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,160
I'm afraid she's just chasing Cheng's clout.

43
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,670
No, I disagree.

44
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,800
If they're together, how can they play games well?

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,130
I don't want to watch their games anymore.

46
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,070
Now you know why I've been trying to hide it.

47
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,450
Once it's exposed,

48
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,410
Your Majesty,

49
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,700
you'll lose half of your kingdom.

50
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,700
Then do you know

51
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,280
why I agreed to let you hide it?

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,390
For your half of the...

53
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,720
Don't you dare say that.

54
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:10,890
I dare not.

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,470
I was worried those crazy fans might smear you,

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,959
saying your poor performance in matches

57
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
is because you're dating me,

58
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,130
questioning your motive for being a professional player, or something like that.

59
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,010
I don't care.

60
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,910
I care.

61
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,909
Yes.

62
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,470
It might not happen.

63
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,360
Even if it does,

64
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,140
I'm confident we can prove them wrong with our results.

65
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,800
But I don't want you to think about those things.

66
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,420
You're already someone who loves gossip.

67
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,220
You'll definitely be affected.

68
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,780
That is also why

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,730
I hesitated about being together.

70
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,490
After all, if a male player from another team

71
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,470
wants to pursue you,

72
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,230
I'll be the first to object.

73
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,070
I'll warn that person

74
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,960
that he should stay away from you

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,220
because you need to focus on your career.

76
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,550
And then?

77
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,900
Why are you laughing?

78
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,250
Don't worry about that.

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,090
And then?

80
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,810
To celebrate our victory,

81
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,080
I'll treat everyone to breakfast tomorrow.

82
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,670
I'll treat you to KFC. Order whatever you want.

83
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,980
I want a cheese pork tenderloin panini and latte.

84
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,960
-A grilled chicken cutlet panini.
-Thank you, mwah!

85
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,450
And a cup of soybean milk.

86
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,360
Then I'll have a bowl of beef congee with raw beef slices.

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,420
-Thank you.
-Okay.

88
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,470
Cheng, what would you like to eat?

89
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,360
I'll pass.

90
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,850
I'm a bit sleepy. I'm going upstairs to rest.

91
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,960
Why am I already feeling a bit hungry?

92
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,460
Tong Yao.

93
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,090
Did you leave something in my room during the past few days?

94
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,940
No.

95
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,910
Buy me a tea egg too. Thanks.

96
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,670
You really have a big appetite.

97
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,980
Are you sure you didn't leave anything in my room?

98
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,810
I think I indeed left something

99
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,130
in Cheng's room.

100
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,830
It should be my power bank.

101
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,270
Mind your own business.

102
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,840
Where is he?

103
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,580
Cheng.

104
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,380
Do you want breakfast?

105
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,690
I can order for you.

106
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,570
Panini or congee?

107
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,110
I want you.

108
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,510
Captain.

109
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,390
I'm not flexible enough.

110
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,790
My back is about to break.

111
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,960
Why are you hiding?

112
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,520
I'm not going to do anything to you.

113
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,590
You're very dangerous.

114
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,130
Do we really have to talk like this?

115
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,750
You can just lie down.

116
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,180
Pervert.

117
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,080
I came to thank you

118
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,350
for trying so hard to support the "Protect the Carry" strategy

119
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,570
and demonstrating textbook-level skills in turning around a challenging situation.

120
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,850
And thank you for declaring you already have someone

121
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,810
in your heart in front of everyone.

122
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,750
Your way of expressing gratitude lacks sincerity.

123
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,210
Well...

124
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,720
are you free tomorrow?

125
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,590
Yes.

126
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,790
Then let's go on a date.

127
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,750
Okay.

128
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,290
But...

129
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,950
before the date,

130
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,380
shouldn't we kiss first?

131
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,800
No.

132
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,310
See you tomorrow.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,960
Pang, I bet you a panini

134
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,190
that Cheng will definitely appear within three seconds.

135
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,650
Where are you going?

136
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,740
There's KFC breakfast prepared for you

137
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,700
on the table.

138
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,400
You guys eat. I'm going out to buy something.

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,050
I'm going with her to buy things.

140
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,560
Why do you two always dress as if

141
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,620
you were going to tie the knot whenever you go out alone?

142
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm like this every day.

143
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,820
Me too.

144
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,610
Come on. You're not.

145
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,960
The last time I saw you dress up so carefully

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,980
was when you went with Cheng to the Flower, Bird, Fish, Insect Market

147
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,100
to buy goldfish.

148
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,050
And that was the only time.

149
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,920
So what?

150
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,510
People from the countryside should dress up when they go into the town.

151
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,420
Do you have a problem with that?

152
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,680
When did you two start seeing each other?

153
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,500
I was betrayed.

154
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,750
The AD I cultivated with great effort

155
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,550
has actually abandoned me and gone to the mid lane?

156
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,910
He's just kidding.

157
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,840
But I can't accept

158
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,850
that Cheng's future son might be as short as his mom

159
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,380
and spend his life being ridiculed.

160
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,180
Shut up!

161
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,680
Don't laugh.

162
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,630
Let's go.

163
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,110
Normal people like us

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,500
can only lift weights alone.

165
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,640
What's wrong? Why're you so glum?

166
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,000
Lu Sicheng,

167
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,820
why didn't you refute him just now?

168
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,620
Do you agree with what he said?

169
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,900
I'm so angry.

170
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,450
The Lu family's perfect genes

171
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,770
are about to be tainted by the inferior genes

172
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,080
of a girl who's barely over 160 cm.

173
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,140
It doesn't matter.

174
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,590
He was just teasing you.

175
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,810
You're as tall as my mom.

176
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,940
Look at me and my brother. Are we short?

177
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,240
When our son plays basketball,

178
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,300
he'll grow taller.

179
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,510
Don't worry.

180
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,520
Who said anything about us having a son?

181
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,120
A daughter would be nice too.

182
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,060
It'd be great if she could be like you.

183
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,940
She could go charm a tall boy.

184
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,680
Perfect.

185
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,010
Actually, I quite like girls.

186
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,990
Boys are too mischievous.

187
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,560
Shut up.

188
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,230
Can't I even fantasize a little?

189
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,030
No.

190
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,590
Can't you fantasize about something normal?

191
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,170
Why do I feel like you're laughing?

192
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,350
I'm not.

193
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,410
Captain,

194
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,870
don't you think

195
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,660
your recent behavior conflicts with your public image?

196
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,380
How so?

197
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,220
I thought

198
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,620
Chessman was calm, composed,

199
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,000
sharp, and wise.

200
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,470
I didn't expect you to be a shameless smooth-talker,

201
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,420
a rogue.

202
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm heartbroken.

203
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,440
Do you remember

204
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,670
the first time we met?

205
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,920
I mistook you for a delivery person

206
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,100
and slammed the door in your face.

207
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,700
What did you think of me then?

208
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,620
A moron.

209
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,510
At that time,

210
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,800
I was already far from the person

211
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
you thought I was.

212
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,300
But a moron is different from a rogue.

213
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,940
In front of other girls,

214
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,220
I'm a gentleman.

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,010
Isn't this good?

216
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,650
You can freely enjoy my inner self

217
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,900
all on your own.

218
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,550
Rogue.

219
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,580
Yes.

220
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,180
That's it.

221
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
-I tried...
-That was so close.

222
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,010
I failed.

223
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,290
That one.

224
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,740
Forget it. I don't want to play this anymore.

225
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,590
The money I've spent here

226
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,970
is enough to buy a bunch of the same stuff online.

227
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,760
Exactly.

228
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,600
But this one is really cute.

229
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,350
-I really want it.
-I want this.

230
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,530
We'll buy ten of them.

231
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,260
I want this cream-colored one.

232
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,790
I only want it.

233
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,690
-So handsome.
-He's so handsome.

234
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,010
So handsome.

235
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
Which one do you want?

236
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,320
Don't I already have one?

237
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,710
This one with a hat.

238
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,640
It's different.

239
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,300
It's really hard to get the rabbit.

240
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,020
Yeah.

241
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,760
We spent so much time here and still couldn't get it.

242
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,430
Yeah. It's too difficult.

243
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,800
Oh my God!

244
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,060
Amazing.

245
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,800
-He did it!
-He did it!

246
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,950
-Bravo.
-Awesome.

247
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,270
Another one!

248
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,350
-Impressive!
-Impressive!

249
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,050
So cool.

250
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,230
I want that doll too.

251
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,820
Which one is cute?

252
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,810
This doll is so cute.

253
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,170
I want it too.

254
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,520
The one in the middle.

255
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,230
What?

256
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,600
-I'm so envious.
-Nothing.

257
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,300
I want to be in love.

258
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,350
It's so romantic.

259
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,010
Back at the amusement park,

260
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,530
when I kept getting scammed by those claw machines, I thought

261
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,310
one day,

262
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,910
I'd find a capable boyfriend

263
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,620
who can get every doll and make them go bankrupt.

264
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,450
You did it.

265
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,390
What?

266
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,880
You have a capable boyfriend.

267
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,580
Which amusement park?

268
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,300
Let's go buy tickets.

269
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,410
I'll make them go bankrupt.

270
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,810
Tokyo Disneyland.

271
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,810
What do you want to eat later?

272
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,040
That ice cream shop downstairs is pretty good.

273
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,810
Ice cream for lunch? Really?

274
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,470
Why can't I have ice cream for lunch?

275
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,830
Are you a three-year-old girl?

276
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,290
Am I not a three-year-old girl in your heart?

277
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,470
You should love me forever,

278
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,230
spoil me, and never lie to me.

279
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,050
-You guys go that way.
-We'll go this way.

280
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,780
-Bye bye.
-Let's leave together. See you next time.

281
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,070
I need to pee. See you at the cinema later.

282
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,830
Bye bye.

283
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,750
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

284
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,320
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

285
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,260
Bye bye.

286
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,960
No-Nothing. Let's go.

287
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,710
Why didn't you wait for me at the cinema just now?

288
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,310
Why did you run away just now?

289
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,510
I saw some of our fans at the entrance

290
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,000
of the sushi restaurant,

291
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,800
so I let go of your hand.

292
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,510
Oh.

293
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,790
What are you doing?

294
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,190
What's wrong with you?

295
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,050
Why are you buying a mask?

296
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,390
I'm being considerate. You don't want me to be seen.

297
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,870
Lu Sicheng, say something.

298
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,010
What's wrong?

299
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,890
I'm too ugly to be seen in public.

300
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,510
Lu Sicheng, don't be angry.

301
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,080
That's not what I meant.

302
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,320
What?

303
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,830
Alright.

304
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,310
I'm sorry, okay?

305
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,230
Can you forgive me?

306
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,820
Our fans were there just now.

307
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,350
Is it appropriate for them to see us holding hands on the street?

308
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,620
Remember those fans' comments

309
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,660
I showed you?

310
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,650
They don't accept that you have a girlfriend.

311
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,350
They don't accept it.

312
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,349
I don't care.

313
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,619
Give the mask back to me.

314
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,069
You don't care, but I do.

315
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,780
I'm not worried that they would

316
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,859
treat me like how they treated Chen Jinyang.

317
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,089
I'm not worried they'd say I'm neglecting my career

318
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,150
just to flirt with their idol either.

319
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,839
I just know that since you became a professional player,

320
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,190
no one has ever found fault with you,

321
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,530
not even the Esports Farm,

322
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,330
which only criticizes players.

323
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,600
So?

324
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,830
So I refuse to be the one

325
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,520
they use against you.

326
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,550
But you already are.

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,640
Everyone has weaknesses.

328
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,720
I have one too.

329
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,820
It's you.

330
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't care what others say about me.

331
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,460
If it's positive,

332
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,490
great.

333
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,260
But I won't let their opinions

334
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,460
dictate my behavior.

335
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,890
My reputation

336
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,320
is a result of my actions,

337
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,520
not something I shape

338
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,370
by acting to please others.

339
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,570
Do you get what I mean?

340
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,450
I just fell in love with a young lady, that's all.

341
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,030
I didn't do anything wrong.

342
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,430
Why are you always so anxious to protect me?

343
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,790
Let's go.

344
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,100
It happened so quickly just now.

345
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,500
I didn't even realize it.

346
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,690
Let's do it again, okay?

347
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,240
What's with the "tsk"?

348
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,300
Expressing my disappointment.

349
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,350
Listen, Xiamen is really great.

350
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,390
There's plenty of free time to relax,

351
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,820
and not much to worry about.

352
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,020
There are big waves, gyms,

353
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,240
great spots for taking photos, and even spas.

354
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,410
It's really nice.

355
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,610
Did you two go to Las Vegas

356
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,860
to register your marriage?

357
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,260
You're back so late.

358
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,330
Cheng, Cheng.

359
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,510
Now that you two are back,

360
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,650
I have something to tell you.

361
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,390
The club has arranged for us to participate in an event.

362
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,070
It's very simple.

363
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,650
It's just a fan meet-and-greet.

364
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,510
We'll record a vlog, just for fun.

365
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,540
Since Cheng doesn't want to go,

366
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,200
I guess I'll have to cancel the tickets to Xiamen.

367
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,330
-Cancelled.
-What?

368
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,650
Where to?

369
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
Xiamen?

370
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,030
If we don't go,

371
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,990
we'll miss out on

372
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,870
an opportunity to taste the food there.

373
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,670
We'll miss out on

374
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,070
an opportunity to explore this beautiful city.

375
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,740
-Yes.
-Yes.

376
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,760
What a pity.

377
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,050
What a pity.

378
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,860
D-Don't.

379
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,510
Is our hotel far from the night market?

380
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,270
Has the event schedule been released yet?

381
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,930
What time does the meeting start, and when does it end?

382
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,440
If we finish too late, the night market might close.

383
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,670
All of you, don't drag your feet by that time.

384
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,110
No matter what you say,

385
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,790
in the end, it's up to Cheng if we're going or not.

386
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,800
Cheng, are we going or not?

387
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,720
Yes.

388
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,280
It looks really great.

389
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,680
-Yeah.
-Why can't I pass?

390
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,800
K.

391
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,020
Hurry up. All you know is playing.

392
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,160
-Okay.
-I wonder when the event this afternoon

393
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,970
-can end.
-Let me finish this round.

394
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,150
You're terrible at it.

395
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,200
You're worse.

396
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,520
Listen.

397
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,630
My playlist?

398
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,790
There's a small issue with the club's booking.

399
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,750
The rooms won't be ready until 8 a.m.

400
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,070
Everyone, stay calm.

401
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,850
I just checked the reviews.

402
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,190
The restaurant in this hotel is highly rated.

403
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,190
Why don't we go get something to eat?

404
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,380
Sure.

405
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,500
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

406
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,790
-Good idea.
-Let's go.

407
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,560
Hurry up. Let's go.

408
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,200
Cheng,

409
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,040
help me take my suitcase upstairs.

410
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,240
I'll call my mom to let her know I'm safe.

411
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,970
Say hello to your mom for me.

412
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,380
Hello, Mom.

413
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,850
Yes, we've arrived in Xiamen.

414
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,060
It's nice here.

415
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,520
It's just raining a bit.

416
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,640
Don't worry about me.

417
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,500
I'm hanging up.

418
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,830
Miss, are you Smiling?

419
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,170
You are...

420
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,510
It really is you!

421
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,690
I'm your fan!

422
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,150
Before you became a professional player,

423
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,050
I already loved watching your livestreaming shows.

424
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,180
I'm also a mid laner.

425
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,790
I've learned so many techniques from you.

426
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,250
My current rank is not bad.

427
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,870
If my rank goes up a bit more, I might meet you in a game.

428
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,390
My dream is to play a game with you.

429
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,430
Miss, can I have your autograph?

430
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,430
Sure.

431
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,260
Yang!

432
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,890
I just took my eyes off you for a second and you slipped away again.

433
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,820
And you were talking to a stranger.

434
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,390
Can you give me a break?

435
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,920
I didn't slip away.

436
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,960
And I wasn't talking to a stranger.

437
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,990
She is

438
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,860
an esports player I like.

439
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,060
What player?

440
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,030
Esports.

441
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,990
Fine. Esports.

442
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,630
Isn't it just playing games?

443
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,870
You kids

444
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,590
are obsessed with games instead of your studies.

445
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,670
You also come up with all sorts of excuses.

446
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,490
Let's go.

447
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,970
Miss Smiling,

448
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,280
I also want to become a professional player and a champion.

449
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,140
I'm counting on you in winning

450
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,380
this year's national championship.

451
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,710
Goodbye, Miss Smiling.

452
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,780
Alright, let's go.

453
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,490
Alright. Don't slip away again.

454
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,440
Why are you here?

455
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,850
You disappeared for 30 minutes.

456
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,650
I thought you'd been kidnapped.

457
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,180
I don't have any money.

458
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,620
I've only been a professional player for three months,

459
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,470
and my entire salary has already been docked.

460
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,240
My net worth is in the negatives.

461
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,160
I have money.

462
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,970
What if they kidnapped you and demanded a ransom from me?

463
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,100
Even if they asked for five million yuan, I'd have to pay.

464
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,020
Who was that kid just now?

465
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,270
A fan.

466
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,010
What did he say?

467
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,360
He asked for my autograph.

468
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,250
He said he also wants to become a professional player.

469
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,400
But his mom is against it.

470
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,000
I have a question for you.

471
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,900
Have I passed my probation?

472
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,400
I was just drinking some yogurt and taking a walk.

473
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,560
How did I end up stumbling on the greatest secret of the century

474
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,690
without any mental preparation?

475
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,360
What's wrong with you?

476
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,120
I'm just a cute chubby guy.

477
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,680
What?

478
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,510
Are you going to silence me?

479
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,540
Actually, I don't have anything to ask.

480
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,790
How long has it been?

481
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,790
It's been a while.

482
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,910
You hid it well.

483
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,100
No one suspected a thing.

484
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,080
Well...

485
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,950
who took the initiative first?

486
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,410
Me.

487
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
I threatened her.

488
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,140
If she didn't comply,

489
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,420
I'd throw away her cat.

490
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,740
So she obediently gave in.

491
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,150
Are you satisfied with my answer?

492
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,970
This isn't right, you two.

493
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,290
There's only one girl in our team.

494
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,570
We've all been pampering and protecting her.

495
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,710
Captain, as the team leader,

496
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,830
you just made a move to win her heart behind our backs?

497
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,030
Should I just let you guys win her heart?

498
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,960
You...

499
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,920
I'm the captain,

500
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,940
not a saint.

501
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,480
And you, Tong Yao.

502
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,030
You said you'd focus on your career.

503
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,720
You said you wouldn't date esports players

504
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
because esports players are jerks.

505
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,600
Have you forgotten?

506
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,690
Captain is not like Jian Yang.

507
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,940
He doesn't lie.

508
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,890
He usually just watches game videos

509
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,130
and climbs the ranks.

510
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,990
I'm feeling more strongly

511
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,610
that the air is filled with the irresistible scent of public display of affection.

512
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,690
How did you two end up together?

513
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,830
I don't know.

514
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,590
I guess we argued, and then we developed feelings for each other.

515
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,990
Have you ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome?

516
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,080
She was very adorable when she tiptoed to hide water bottles

517
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,210
in the supermarket.

518
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,790
She was very adorable when playing games.

519
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,330
When she was defeated by Tai's Tamamonomae,

520
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,080
she sat alone in her seat and cried all night.

521
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,030
And she spent the whole night practicing that shikigami.

522
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,830
Adorable.

523
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,940
When she won the match,

524
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,790
she trash talked to God Yang

525
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,650
arrogantly and rudely.

526
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,590
Adorable.

527
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,790
And when she beat me in a solo match,

528
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,500
her arrogant look made her even cuter.

529
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,650
I was just asking.

530
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,430
I can list many more reasons.

531
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,360
Save them

532
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,090
for your wedding in the chapel.

533
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,340
Don't you want to hear them?

534
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,300
One last question.

535
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,400
How far...

536
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,560
have you two gone?

537
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,120
Just what you saw. Nothing beyond that.

538
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,510
What else do you want to know?

539
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,580
I'll tell you everything.

540
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,700
Nothing, nothing.

541
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,010
You two, please leave me alone.

542
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,650
Go.

543
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,750
You two leave first.

544
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,780
Go far away.

545
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,420
Oh, right. I've run out of my spray.

546
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,530
I'm going to buy a new one.

547
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,250
No.

548
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,270
From now on, just tell me what you want.

549
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,470
I'll go buy it for you.

550
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,820
I've been your support for two years,

551
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,760
and you've never even bought me a bottle of face wash.

552
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,720
-Don't be late tomorrow morning.
-I'm going back to my room.

553
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,870
-Okay.
-Don't be late tomorrow morning.

554
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,910
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

555
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,280
After we finish recording the vlog tomorrow,

556
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,210
where should we go to have fun?

557
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,470
Where do you want to go?

558
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,560
Let's go eat something delicious.

559
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,290
Sounds good.

560
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,770
Miss,

561
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,600
how are you two sleeping tonight?

562
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,520
What's the matter?

563
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,900
What are you doing?

564
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,630
I just finished my face mask.

565
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
We need to get up early tomorrow.

566
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,680
I'm so sleepy.

567
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,450
I feel like I could fall asleep at any moment.

568
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,880
Make sure the door's locked.

569
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,140
Put a chair by the door.

570
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,530
To keep a thief or you out?

571
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,680
To keep me out.

572
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,060
Alright, I'm hanging up.

573
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,800
Bye bye.

574
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,360
My private life

575
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,940
is filled with your lovey-dovey stuff.

576
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,470
I'll just eat my pork jerky.

577
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,110
Will you ever stop?

578
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,800
At the thought of the scene

579
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,160
in the hotel lobby today

580
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,910
that stirred my heart,

581
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,310
I can't stay calm.

582
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,130
So I have to take it out on you.

583
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,620
I consider Tong Yao as a teammate.

584
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,280
But you want to cross the line.

585
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,080
Cheng,

586
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,160
Tong Yao is great.

587
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,620
Look at God Yang,

588
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,580
Guang, and Lee Kunsuk.

589
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,550
They all have our mid laner's back.

590
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,230
If it weren't for winning the games,

591
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,240
they probably wouldn't have come to gank.

592
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
If you have any scumbag tendencies,

593
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,240
half of the junglers

594
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,390
from the 12 teams of OPL

595
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,850
would be lurking around our bot lane.

596
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,600
It doesn't matter if you get hurt.

597
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,330
But don't forget I, a cute boy, am also a bot laner.

598
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,750
One wrong move from you, and we both go down.

599
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,830
What exactly are you trying to say?

600
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,390
Cheng,

601
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,360
you have quite a few competitors.

602
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,050
Don't always be aloof just because you're a heartthrob.

603
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,840
I'm not.

604
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,960
When we first got together,

605
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,360
I wanted to tell the whole world

606
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,580
that I have someone I love.

607
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,910
But she wouldn't let me.

608
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,430
Why wouldn't she let you?

609
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,280
At first, I also thought it was best to keep it a secret

610
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,150
because I was worried it would distract her from the game.

611
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,350
But later, I realized

612
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,560
she has already been fully recognized.

613
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,110
Now if anyone

614
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,660
still doubts her,

615
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,030
they would just embarrass themselves.

616
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,930
A clean sweep in the group stage

617
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,920
shows Tong Yao is more than capable

618
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,830
as our mid laner,

619
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,490
totally in sync with the team.

620
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,380
Just when I was figuring out

621
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,610
how to tell everyone,

622
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,760
Ai Jia and Jinyang from another team got into trouble.

623
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,720
It got so big

624
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,740
that even my fans

625
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,830
joined the gossip on Esports Farm.

626
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,110
And she saw it.

627
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,480
Now she always thinks

628
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,080
if I announce that we're together,

629
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,280
I'll lose all my fans.

630
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,630
Young girls just love to think too much.

631
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,320
Is the new facial cleanser good?

632
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,870
Yes.

633
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,410
You're jealous just because of a facial cleanser?

634
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,470
You're so jealous.

635
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,430
She gave it to me on your behalf.

636
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,920
Cheng,

637
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,990
why do you like Tong Yao anyway?

638
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,870
To be honest,

639
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,100
Tong Yao...

640
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,670
is just average-looking,

641
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,680
compared to your countless

642
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,390
beautiful female fans.

643
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,270
Because she's very strong.

644
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,450
Perfunctory.

645
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,390
She's very cute when she cries.

646
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,840
Pervert.

647
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,710
Anything else?

648
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,900
I'll definitely work hard.

649
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,960
So, can I call you Cheng?

650
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,790
♫Who are you missing?♫

651
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,580
That's the flavor.

652
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,260
Love once begun,

653
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,030
will never end.

654
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,590
The voice message is about your man's comment on you.

655
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,270
Play it.

656
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,060
It's quite flirtatious. You should thank me.

657
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,670
Love once begun,

658
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,910
will never end.

659
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,470
Love once begun,

660
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,600
will never end.

661
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,190
You really have got up?

662
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,090
Quickly, show me around your room.

663
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,750
Let me see if there's anyone else there.

664
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,180
There's no one else here.

665
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,150
It's just me.

666
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,410
Then why is your face

667
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,090
so rosy and dewy?

668
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,570
Like you've done something.

669
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,480
What are you talking about?

670
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,910
That's because I applied a facial mask last night, okay?

671
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,840
That's some noticeable love glow.

672
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,840
Keep it up.

673
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,000
You're going out with Ai Jia today, right?

674
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,730
Why haven't you dressed up yet?

675
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,630
I'm not going.

676
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,990
Why not?

677
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,870
Actually,

678
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,610
I've been thinking carefully about it

679
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,710
over the past few days.

680
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,870
I think what they said is actually right.

681
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,860
About what?

682
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,880
Who are you trying to mock and attack now?

683
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,900
No,

684
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,980
I'm being serious.

685
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,760
I indeed haven't been able

686
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,690
to stand together with my player boyfriend like you.

687
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,960
In the fans' eyes,

688
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,220
I'm just someone

689
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,730
who can't provide much support for Ai Jia.

690
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,060
Support?

691
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,490
Do you even play games?

692
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,110
What kind of support do they expect?

693
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,770
I'm not good at playing games,

694
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,830
but I can do something else.

695
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,390
Like what?

696
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,140
Like... buying his team for him

697
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,870
and giving him a pay increase.

698
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,930
By that time, when his fans see him,

699
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,260
they'd think like this:

700
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,050
this handsome man's every strand

701
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,850
of hair is washed with shampoo

702
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,280
bought with the money

703
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,770
from that annoying woman.

704
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,970
But they can't tell him to refuse his salary.

705
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,040
So what can they do?

706
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,760
There's nothing they can do.

707
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,270
It's so frustrating.

708
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,190
The joy of the wealthy is simply beyond my reach.

709
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,890
I just love how they hate me

710
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,370
yet can't do anything about it.

711
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,810
You're not serious, are you?

712
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,290
Maybe I am.

713
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,760
Oh, right.

714
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,580
You're going to record a vlog today, right?

715
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,580
Hurry up and get dressed up.

716
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,560
Don't embarrass yourself, okay?

717
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,530
Okay.

718
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,780
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

719
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,430
We just finished the fan meet-and-greet.

720
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,990
The fans in Xiamen are so enthusiastic.

721
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,610
Now I'm at the food street,

722
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,250
planning to eat.

723
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,920
I don't know where they are either.

724
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,980
Let me look for

725
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,600
your favorite Cheng for you.

726
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,550
Where's Cheng?

727
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,900
Where's Cheng?

728
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,190
Our Cheng is...

729
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
It smells so good.

730
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,720
What's that smell?

731
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,940
It's pork jerky.

732
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,930
Pang recorded it. What should we do?

733
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,550
It's not a livestreaming show. Don't worry.

734
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,280
I'll ask him to delete it later.

735
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,100
Delete it.

736
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,960
Delete it?

737
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,970
Can't I keep it for myself to enjoy?

738
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,670
Tell me, how do you plan to make me keep it a secret?

739
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,620
What are you up to now?

740
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,970
I think this matter

741
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,670
can't be settled without some pork jerky.

742
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,520
Welcome to Bestore.

743
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,940
We have numerous types of premium snacks.

744
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,270
What would you two like?

745
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,280
We'll pick some ourselves.

746
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,920
Okay.

747
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,520
This one.

748
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,110
-Picked. Picked.
-Picked. Picked.

749
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,560
We're here to buy snacks for Pang.

750
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,100
Aren't you worried you'll gain weight eating this?

751
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,960
Don't worry, sir.

752
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,590
Our snacks are made with premium ingredients.

753
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,920
They are delicious and won't make you gain weight.

754
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,780
Do you hear her?

755
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,310
Please get us two boxes of pork jerky. Thank you.

756
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:20,990
Okay.

757
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,610
Dried mango?

758
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,950
I want it.

759
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,810
You're like a rabbit.

760
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,740
-Give it to me.
-No.

761
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,470
-Give it to me.
-No.

762
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,280
You're bullying me just because you're tall, huh?

763
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,340
Even the worm turns.

764
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,570
-I'm not giving it to you.
-Give it to me.

765
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,840
-No.
-Give it to me.

766
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:40,920
No.

767
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,670
Lu Sicheng.

768
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,080
I'm not giving it to you.

769
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,790
Um...

770
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,390
here's your pork jerky.

771
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,780
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

772
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,610
Take your time.

773
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,710
Let me know if you need anything else.

774
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,180
Okay.

775
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,270
Give it to me.

776
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,330
Look at you.

777
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,540
Look. They came out.

778
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,430
Hello, who are you looking for?

779
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,930
-Is that him?
-We're looking for him!

780
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,080
You brat!

781
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,390
You brat! Come here!

782
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,300
You brat! Why didn't you answer our calls?

783
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,570
How dare you not answer my calls!

784
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,240
How many times have we called you?

785
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,370
Where are you going?

786
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,860
-Why are you running away?
-How dare you run away!

787
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,560
Uncle, Auntie.

788
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,090
Do you hear me? Come back!

789
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,400
-Calm down.
-I said come back!

790
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,060
-Let's go inside first.
-Let's go inside first, Uncle.

791
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,460
-I'm so angry!
-Let's go.

792
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,660
How dare he run away!
