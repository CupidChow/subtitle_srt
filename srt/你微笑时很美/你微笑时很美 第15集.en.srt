Why didn't you stop him?

23

How could I possibly stop him?

24

I heard his date is 172 cm tall.

She has a master's degree in finance from overseas.

What's so great about a master's degree?

Let me give you some advice.

36
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,500
You'd better pray that Cheng has unique tastes

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,079
and prefers short girls. That's more realistic.

38
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,840
Why should I pray that he likes short girls?

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,579
Then, why are you comparing yourself to his blind date

00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,670
You've only practiced for a few days in ranked games, and you dare to use it now?

172
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,310
I don't feel safe with you doing this now.

173
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,870
Why not? I insist on playing Hannya.

174
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,830
Cat, no.

175
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,540
You'd better stick with Ibaraki Doji to be safe.

176
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,190
ZGDX's top laner Cat has chosen

177
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,430
his signature Ibaraki Doji.

178
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,770
What should I pick then, God Ming?

179
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,760
Yasha is still available.

180
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,050
Why don't you take Yasha? I think it's a good choice.

181
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,810
Alright then.

182
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,640
If he's Yasha,

183
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,180
then I can pick a late-game shikigami.

184
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,790
How about Dodomeki? Great for initiating team fights.

185
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,430
Okay.

186
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,340
Where's our mid laner?

187
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,710
Did she go AFK?

188
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,430
Quiet as a mouse.

189
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,600
Tong Yao,

190
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,000
our opponents didn't ban Ootengu.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,260
Why don't you pick Ootengu for this game?

192
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,260
Sis,

193
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,630
do you believe some people, even if they don't speak

194
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,770
or speak very little,

195
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,300
will still end up on the in-game quotes board?

196
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,380
Everyone, let's do our best.

197
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,380
Okay, let's go!

198
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,780
We now see Kun is the first to enter the brush.

199
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,420
But he didn't enter the jungle brush.

200
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,080
He entered the mid lane brush.

201
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,830
Interesting, very interesting.

202
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,880
Chen Yao, have you noticed?

203
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,090
This jungler Kun,

204
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,470
at the start of the game, he's not jungling.

205
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,660
But he's going straight to gank the mid lane.

206
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,310
Have you ever seen this kind of move before?

207
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,110
No, I haven't.

208
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,030
But I have to say,

209
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,430
Kun's Mannendake

210
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,630
can cause great damage in the early game.

211
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,150
Yes. One combo of skills,

212
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,150
and Tong Yao is left with only one-third of her health.

213
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,710
Both sides have reached level four now.

214
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,500
Now, Tong Yao

215
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,830
can only farm cautiously under her tower.

216
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,510
Let's take a look at Kun's position.

217
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,810
Kun is still in the mid lane river.

218
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,370
Go, go!

219
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,630
Kun. Kun is coming again. No way!

220
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,060
Forcing Ootengu to blink and retreat back under the tower.

221
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,300
What is Kun up to?

222
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,070
Once their Susabi reaches level six,

223
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,410
with an economic advantage, he'll want to solo kill Ootengu.

224
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,870
Can they escape this time?

225
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,290
Over here,

226
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,750
K from Team ZGDX

227
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,770
arrived just in time.

228
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,810
He saved Smiling in the nick of time.

229
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,920
With a combo of skills,

230
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,160
Susabi fled in panic.

231
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,910
-Yes. Yes.
-The Ootengu is safe for now.

232
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,830
After clearing this wave of minions,

233
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,910
Ootengu should return to base to recover.

234
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,140
Oh my god, she didn't go back. She's starting to counterattack.

235
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,950
She dodged Susabi's ultimate and started chasing.

236
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,810
She directly hit Susabi, who only had half of his health left.

237
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,710
Can he escape this time?

238
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,130
Tong Yao, don't chase too deep.

239
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,430
Now it's time for revenge, settling old scores.

240
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,970
You were just beating me down,

241
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,390
and now I'm sending you back home.

242
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,990
Oh my god, Kun came out of the grass again!

243
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,650
He instantly killed Tong Yao.

244
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,590
It's so painful that Tong Yao got solo killed!

245
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,430
What's wrong with Kun today?

246
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,020
Is he planning to set up camp in the enemy's mid lane?

247
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,410
It's only been a few minutes since the game started,

248
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,480
and he's already ganked Smiling two or three times.

249
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,670
It seems the mid lane is going to be very tough today.

250
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,670
And if this continues,

251
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,510
Tong Yao won't be able to farm at all.

252
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,350
Yes, indeed.

253
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,750
What's going on with Kun?

254
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,230
Did she offend FNATIC's jungler or something?

255
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,890
What kind of strategy is that?

256
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,790
I hope Tong Yao can hold steady.

257
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,550
Not likely. She's definitely going to blow up.

258
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,270
Shut up.

259
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,950
What we're seeing now is

260
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,630
that Kun has come to ZGDX's bottom jungle again.

261
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,080
Now, let's see when Smiling

262
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,130
will bring the minion wave out of the tower.

263
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,190
I'm a bit puzzled.

264
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,730
Doesn't this Kun need to farm?

265
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,160
He's not even taking his own jungle.

266
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,170
He's either ganking mid lane

267
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,670
or on his way to gank mid lane.

268
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,790
Look, as expected,

269
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,680
Kun has ganked Smiling again.

270
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,790
It's so tough for Smiling.

271
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,450
I...

272
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,320
Will this ever end?

273
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,710
Two lanes of the game map have been cut off.

274
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,570
Only the middle is left.

275
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,360
He's not even clearing his jungle, but just camping me in mid.

276
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,570
Don't rush, sis.

277
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,460
There's still time. Take it slow.

278
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,300
Sis finally spoke.

279
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,590
You scared me.

280
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,880
I thought someone had possessed you.

281
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,750
Someone?

282
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,640
I'm not mute.

283
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,920
Tong Yao, go hide under the tower.

284
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,850
Farm carefully.

285
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,450
It seems Tong Yao will be traumatized by mid lane today.

286
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,210
Here I come, sis.

287
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,490
My goodness, Kun went to the mid lane for a tower dive again.

288
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,770
A tower dive!

289
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,070
How did Smiling just get crushed, too?

290
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,070
What's going on?

291
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,600
He forced a kill, even if it's a one-for-one trade.

292
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,670
I don't understand. I don't understand.

293
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,430
Is he crazy?

294
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,190
He used no skills but still dove the tower with both summoner spells.

295
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,910
Even trading one for one to kill my jungler.

296
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,740
What the heck is that?

297
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,350
Why didn't we ban Mannendake earlier?

298
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,390
If he dares to show up one more time, I'll puke for you to see.

299
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,230
Hang in there, bro.

300
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,750
I can't hang in there anymore.

301
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,070
Push the first tower quickly and group up.

302
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,950
I don't want to lane anymore.

303
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,310
The enemy is treating mid lane like a duo lane.

304
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,910
I can't even leave the tower.

305
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,620
Look.

306
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,100
I told you she'd blow up.

307
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,440
It's all your fault.

308
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,420
Right.

309
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,940
It's my fault for not being in the game.

310
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,980
Jinx.

311
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,310
You're the jinx.

312
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,240
You're the jinx.

313
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,550
You're the jinx, you.

314
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,910
Go FNATIC!

315
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,380
Smiling activates her ultimate, interrupting FNC's attempt at Orochi.

316
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,670
FNC's Kun arrives just in time.

317
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,600
Let's see if they can steal Orochi.

318
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,190
Alright, now we see

319
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,690
the fight for Orochi on this side is in full swing.

320
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,580
FNATIC members are consecutively taken down by Chessman.

321
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,930
But Kun completely ignores Chessman's arrival.

322
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,960
He continues to use his ultimate to jump over the wall and chase Smiling.

323
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,590
Smiling is chased down and killed.

324
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,550
Seriously? Still chasing me in this situation?

325
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,590
They don't want Orochi?

326
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,800
With this kind of gank, even my three-second shield isn't fast enough.

327
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,270
I've already contributed half of our team's deaths.

328
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,110
Team ZGDX's jungler, K,

329
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,630
has caught up with the enemy jungler, Kun.

330
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,320
He's already taken Orochi.

331
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,090
The minion wave of the Hundred Ghosts Night Parade has spawned.

332
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,070
I'm so angry!

333
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,540
Don't be angry. We're about to win.

334
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,070
Group up.

335
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,990
Team ZGDX has now gained

336
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,150
an advantageous minion wave.

337
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,290
They're ready to directly attack the tower.

338
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,830
Attack the tower! Attack the tower!

339
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,630
Almostâ€¦

340
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,350
The game is over!

341
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,670
Yes!

342
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,280
Congratulations to Team ZGDX

343
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,030
for winning this match!

344
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,090
Congratulations!

345
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,380
Sis, don't be upset anymore.

346
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,910
I'm filled with rage right now.

347
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,190
Rage, you understand?

348
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,110
How long are you going to stand there and reflect?

349
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,510
Come over and let's discuss the next match.

350
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,160
Hello.

351
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,070
Sis,

352
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,880
can you say hello to my fans?

353
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,530
Hello everyone, I'm Smiling from Team ZGDX.

354
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,590
Sis,

355
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,950
they say we make a good match.

356
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,710
Cute, right?

357
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,260
Aren't we cute?

358
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,310
Bro,

359
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,140
what are you doing?

360
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,420
No livestreaming allowed here.

361
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,579
Can I add you on WeChat?

362
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,030
Give me your WeChat account. Let's be friends.

363
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,930
I'll scan your code.

364
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,980
Thank you, Sis.

365
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,570
You're very cute.

366
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,170
What's going on?

367
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
You're collecting contacts again.

368
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,920
What do you mean?

369
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,330
He already has all our WeChat contacts.

370
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,430
Don't listen to Cheng.

371
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,510
Tong Yao, come here quickly.

372
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,390
Let's summarize together

373
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,700
the issues from the last match,

374
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,360
so we can plan for the next one.

375
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,550
Alright, welcome back.

376
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,980
The match has now reached its middle stage.

377
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,810
This round, Kun is in a terrible situation.

378
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,660
Every time he tries to farm the bottom jungle,

379
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,910
Chessman chases him down.

380
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,030
He's already died three times.

381
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,950
Yes, in this game, Chessman is

382
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,310
relentlessly pursuing Kun.

383
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,110
It's like he's determined to completely eliminate Kun.

384
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,670
On the other hand, in this round, Smiling

385
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,720
has changed her fate from being constantly ganked in the last game.

386
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,880
She's coordinating with Chessman, roaming.

387
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,940
She shows a strong spirit of revenge.

388
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,450
Yes, yes, exactly.

389
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,190
Now, let's look at

390
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,670
the two towers in the top lane.

391
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,000
They have already been destroyed.

392
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,130
The bottom lane has been constantly supported by Smiling, the mid laner.

393
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,330
Tong Yao, be careful.

394
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,970
So, looking at their enemy's jungler, Kun,

395
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,190
Kun's farming in this game has been really weak.

396
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,100
I'm going to gank Tong Yao.

397
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,030
Not only is he behind in economy,

398
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,290
but now he's basically been reduced to

399
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,830
being caught wherever he goes.

400
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,550
Cheng, don't you want me anymore?

401
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,550
Defend the tower! Defend the tower!

402
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,540
Oh my god!

403
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,390
Chessman eliminated Kun with a single move.

404
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:47,830
That...

405
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,110
That is another revenge for Smiling.

406
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,270
Pang, follow me.

407
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,820
Here I come.

408
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,280
K, stick to the usual plan.

409
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,790
Roger that.

410
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,750
It seems like this time, FNATIC

411
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,890
is being forced to initiate a team fight.

412
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,120
-In this round, Team ZGDX is fighting 5v4.
-Retreat. Retreat.

413
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,270
If they win this fight,

414
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,920
-with an advantage in the minion wave,
Go! Go!

415
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,550
they could charge all the way to their high ground.

416
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,280
The fight has started. It's on!

417
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,760
-K, come in.
-Here I come.

418
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,720
To protect the mid laner's damage dealer,

419
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,920
Team ZGDX has adjusted its overall positioning and lineup.

420
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,380
FNC's ADC has been eliminated again.

421
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,260
They only have

422
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,860
the moderately farmed mid laner Ootengu left.

423
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,400
The mid laner is gone, too!

424
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,990
Go in!

425
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,750
They've completely abandoned the fight. Oh my god!

426
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,350
Come on. Let's go in!

427
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,550
If they don't leave now, they won't be able to leave at all.

428
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,110
Look back. There's no one left to guard the base.

429
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,740
After these two fights, I've realized

430
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,390
that as long as Team ZGDX

431
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,030
has a stable mid laner dealing damage,

432
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,350
the opponents basically have no chance.

433
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,230
It looks like this wave of minions

434
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,020
can't wait for FNC to respawn.

435
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,730
The minions are already at the tower. Is there still a chance?

436
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,460
FNC hasn't respawned yet.

437
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,790
Destroy the tower! Destroy the tower!

438
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,390
Hit them! Hit them! Hit them!

439
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,390
What's going on?

440
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,830
Congratulations to Team ZGDX

441
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,590
for winning this qualifier.

442
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,580
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

443
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,790
Well done, Cheng.

444
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,760
After finishing a match,

445
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,690
I suddenly feel three years older.

446
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,310
Let's go.

447
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,630
Let's go.

448
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,260
Let's go shake hands.

449
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,510
Smiling,

450
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,720
nice to meet you.

451
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,950
Sis, you're very cute.

452
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,340
Keep it up!

453
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm cute, too.

454
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,800
Are we going straight to eat or what?

455
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,520
I'm starving.

456
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,440
Hungry again?

457
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,190
You ate the most at lunch.

458
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,040
He burns a lot of energy.

459
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,150
Aren't you hungry?

460
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,110
Bro.

461
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,100
Bro.

462
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,740
Let's have dinner together.

463
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,050
Come on. Let's go together.

464
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,190
We've already...

465
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,680
Bro, it's been a long time.

466
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,660
Can we have dinner together?

467
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,140
Has he always been this enthusiastic?

468
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,690
You might have some misunderstanding about enthusiasm.

469
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,630
This is what we call "out of control."

470
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,760
Let's go. Let's go.

471
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,970
Come on, come on. Get in the car.

472
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
Okay, okay. Let's go.

473
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,390
Bro, which seat is sis going to sit on?

474
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,040
Sis!

475
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,320
What the hell?

476
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,100
How did he end up on our bus?

477
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,130
Collecting contacts. Well done.

478
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,870
Pang,

479
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,230
switch seats with me.

480
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,290
Where should I sit?

481
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,670
Lu Yue, why don't you sit on the FNATIC's bus?

482
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,310
I won't.

483
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,790
[Not many girls are good at playing games]

484
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,790
[You played well today. You're amazing]

485
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,980
What's wrong?

486
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,030
[Tired? Come out to play after dinner? You ignore me]

487
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,200
I have an idea.

488
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,730
I'm not sure if I should say it.

489
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,580
Don't say it.

490
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,590
I think

491
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,720
the young jungler from Team FNATIC is trying to hit on me.

492
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,990
Do you have the same intention?

493
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,510
I just want to put him and Mannendake

494
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,750
together in a coffin,

495
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,490
nail it shut, and bury it right here,

496
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,890
deep, deep in the ground.

497
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,830
She's my woman. Don't touch her,

498
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,780
you little brat.

499
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,250
What's going on?

500
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,750
What did he say?

501
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,140
And what did you say?

502
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,890
He apologized to you.

503
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,780
What did you say to him

504
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,830
that made him apologize to me?

505
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,840
Did you curse at people again?

506
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Translate it for me.

507
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,500
Never mind.

508
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,900
He won't bother you anymore from now on.

509
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,950
Bro, I have something to ask you.

510
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,190
What is it?

511
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,950
Bro, is it true?

512
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,270
That mid laner in your team...

513
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,750
Is she really your woman?

514
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,820
You moved so fast.

515
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,630
I didn't think you'd be that kind of person.

516
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,850
What kind of person am I?

517
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,310
Do I need to prove it to you?

518
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,160
Yes, please.

519
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,410
Even if she's not now, she will be in the future.

520
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,470
If I've already set my sights on her and am about to pursue her,

521
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,950
how is that any different from her already being my girlfriend?

522
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,080
Just because I haven't won her over yet,

523
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,940
does that mean you can make a move?

524
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,550
Don't be angry with me, bro.

525
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,150
If it's just to protect a teammate,

526
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,330
there's really no need.

527
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,220
I'll treat her well. She's so cute.

528
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,660
The kind you want to cherish and love dearly.

529
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,060
Shut up, kid.

530
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,180
No matter how cute she is, she's still my girl.

531
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,830
Don't think I don't know about your time in Korea, Kunsuk.

532
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,760
You've broken many girls' hearts.

533
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,990
When we drank,

534
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,190
Junhe always

535
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,650
told me about your messes.

536
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,340
The girls in your stories were never the same.

537
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,100
This time, it is different.

538
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,230
If I'm with Tong Yao,

539
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,270
I'll immediately tell the whole world we're together.

540
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,890
I'll even announce it on Instagram. Isn't that enough?

541
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,960
Even the fans in Korea

542
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,840
will know about it.

543
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,420
If everyone is watching me,

544
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,710
what else could I do?

545
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,460
It's like asking for permission from a father-in-law.

546
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
Please, I beg you.

547
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,790
No matter how you look at it, it's not your turn.

548
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,620
Save it.

549
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,870
Bro,

550
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,180
don't you believe in love at first sight?

551
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,110
Watching her yelling during matches,

552
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,550
I find her just so adorable.

553
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,620
In future matches,

554
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,350
I can give her all the kills.

555
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,190
Bro,

556
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,850
please agree.

557
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,050
I like girls like her.

558
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,340
It feels like I've finally met

559
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,510
the one destined for me.

560
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,040
I'll really treat her well.

561
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,270
What do I need to do?

562
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,630
What do I need to do for you to believe me?

563
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,820
Or how about I go beat up Tai?

564
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,260
I said she's my woman.

565
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,480
Cheers!

566
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,080
-I'm so happy.
-You're back.

567
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,670
It's delicious.

568
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,990
Why are you two so late?

569
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,430
The meat is already overcooked.

570
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,190
Don't have a private meeting now.

571
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,990
Hurry and eat. The meat is ready.

572
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,080
That's because of someone in particular.

573
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,200
Cheng,

574
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,960
where did you two go?

575
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,770
You didn't threaten or intimidate him again, did you?

576
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,720
Why would I intimidate him?

577
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,520
Are you crazy?

578
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,140
You're the crazy one.

579
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,530
Cheng isn't usually this fierce.

580
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,060
Eat more. Don't be nervous.

581
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,610
You talk too much.

582
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,690
Serve yourself.

583
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,140
Eat, eat.

584
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,770
Okay.

585
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,480
Let's go.

586
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,120
Why on earth did you ask me to come here?

587
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,420
This place

588
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,510
will be our base from now on.

589
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,200
What do you mean?

590
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,290
Ai Jia has been acting quite well recently.

591
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,490
I've taken him off the internship list.

592
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,510
And he followed me to several places.

593
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,190
He also talked to me about...

594
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,450
life plans and stuff like that.

595
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,650
I thought what he said made sense.

596
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,570
So, I decided to give him another chance.

597
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,760
Since you've decided to start over,

598
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,140
it's not really appropriate to keep living at my grandma's place.

599
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,430
So, I found this place to live.

600
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,190
So, you and Ai Jia have reconciled?

601
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,110
And then, you've

602
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,300
long-term rented this five-star suite near our villa area?

603
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,390
You're really going all out, aren't you?

604
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,150
It's for love, you know.

605
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,200
Why don't you move in too?

606
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,290
No, thanks.

607
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,430
I'll just stay in

608
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,190
that single room in our villa.

609
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,740
The happiness of you rich people,

610
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,810
I don't deserve it.

611
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,320
What do you mean you don't deserve it?

612
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,840
Girl, you deserve it all.

613
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,310
Besides,

614
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,470
if I live closer to you,

615
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,930
it'll be easier for me to help you out, right?

616
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,890
What do you mean by "help out"?

617
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,670
Oh, right. I actually have something to ask you.

618
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,270
Come here.

619
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,670
Here.

620
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,640
Can you translate this for me?

621
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,560
What's this?

622
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,580
She's my woman. Don't touch her,

623
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,620
you little brat.

624
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,060
What the heck?

625
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,930
What do you mean by "what the heck"?

626
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,730
Translate it!

627
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,350
She's my woman.

628
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,310
Don't touch her, you little brat.

629
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,920
You must have a lot of free time lately to watch Korean dramas.

630
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,130
No way.

631
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,230
This can't be Cheng's voice, can it?

632
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,950
What is this?

633
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,600
I told you that you really needed me.

634
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,530
Tell me about it.

635
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,210
I heard you have a match on Sunday.

636
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,420
I bought front-row tickets to watch you.

637
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,100
So,

638
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,680
let's have dinner together after the match.

639
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,340
What's the deal with that woman?

640
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,270
Which woman?

641
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,050
Su Luo?

642
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,850
Isn't she your blind date?

643
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Why did she appear on my friend list?

644
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,850
Well, she has a good impression of you.

645
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,510
She is good-looking and has a nice personality.

646
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,070
In terms of both figure and family background,

647
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,110
she's quite a good match for you.

648
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,840
Mom approves too, doesn't she?

649
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,310
By the time I say it for the third time,

650
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,200
you'll be lying on the ground.

651
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,080
I'll give you one more chance.

652
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Why did she appear on my friend list?

653
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,080
Mrs. Wang told me to.

654
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,020
The day you two had the blind date,

655
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,460
you said it wasn't a good match.

656
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,990
But the girl thought about it for a few days after going home

657
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,420
and still wanted to try adding you on WeChat.

658
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,150
Mrs. Wang said you definitely wouldn't agree,

659
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,060
so she asked meâ€¦

660
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,190
Let me make this clear,

661
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,270
I was threatened.

662
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,950
She said if I didn't obey and do as told,

663
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,480
I'd have to go back and inherit the family business in your place,

664
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,280
and I'd have to go on blind dates.

665
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,220
Bro,

666
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,870
I've been thinking all night.

667
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,430
Although you said she's yours,

668
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,830
I still don't believe it.

669
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,590
I'll come to watch your match this weekend.

670
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,840
If you're really together,

671
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,440
there will be some signs, right?

672
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,620
If you're really with your mid laner,

673
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,870
I'll back off, of course.

674
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,830
If not, I won't hold back,

675
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,010
because I really like her!

676
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,200
Do as you please.

677
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,030
Bro, I'm truly in awe of you.

678
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,440
That day on the bus,

679
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,170
what exactly did you say to her?

680
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,570
Is this how you block your teammate's romantic prospects?

681
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,610
You keep having flings yourself.

682
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,310
Why are you blocking someone else's chances?

683
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,150
What flings?

684
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:25,970
You misheard.

685
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,840
Aren't you going to explain, friend?

686
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,910
My brother actually ran away.

687
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,910
There must be something unspeakable

688
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,430
going on between you two.

689
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:43,850
Right?

690
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,050
Go back and practice your shikigami.

691
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,550
Why are you playing on my account again?

692
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,990
Just let me play for a bit.

693
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,830
Sis, let's play trio.

694
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,670
Go away.

695
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,680
Just a quick game.

696
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,270
Did your computer crash or break down?

697
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,590
I get it now.

698
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,610
You've got your eye on my cat ears.

699
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,430
What? No way.

700
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,070
You definitely have your eye on my cat ears.

701
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,070
No! What are these? They're so ugly.

702
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,290
I'm leaving.

703
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,110
Come on, Cat.

704
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,900
K, come on, trio. Hurry up.

705
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,140
I'm using a face mask.

706
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,510
Do you want one?

707
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,400
No, thanks.

708
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,880
I have plenty.

709
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,960
You look like a coal miner.

710
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,350
As if I'd mine coal at your place.

711
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,940
What's the use of this thing anyway?

712
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,780
Hydration.

713
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,980
Is this okay?

714
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,200
Your team has been performing well this season.

715
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,460
Our current record is pretty good.

716
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,180
You'll be facing us soon.

717
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,680
Yes, the day we defeat you

718
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
is counting down.

719
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,639
Cherish the time you can still dream.

720
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,969
When the countdown ends,

721
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,030
your dream will shatter on the field.

722
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,719
I will make my dream come true.

723
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,420
I heard that Kun has been...

724
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,639
That little punk is asking for trouble.

725
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,440
What's wrong?

726
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,360
I always feel like someone's watching me.

727
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,110
There's no one. Are you seeing things?

728
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,310
Maybe it really is a ghost.

729
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,380
Goodbye.

730
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,330
Get some rest. See you on the field.

731
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,820
That was close. I almost got caught.

732
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,310
So early?

733
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,120
Yeah, I get up early occasionally.

734
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,060
What, do I need to greet you too?

735
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,510
Of course.

736
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,170
You've already told others I'm your woman.

737
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,800
I think even the color of the socks you wear

738
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,200
should be reported to me.

739
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,030
Black.

740
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,350
Satisfied?

741
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,330
That's what I made for Pancake.

742
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,930
Who knew it wouldn't like it?

743
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,660
It'd be a waste to throw it away.

744
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,980
Why don't you eat it?

745
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,630
Okay.

746
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,590
For today's match,

747
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,110
Lee Kunsuk will also come.

748
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,790
Who?

749
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,630
Kun.

750
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,350
Why would he come here?

751
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,110
He doesn't want to give up.

752
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,760
He wants to see if we're really together.

753
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,870
If he finds out it's not true,

754
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,740
you'll become his eighteenth concubine.

755
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,980
Eighteenth?

756
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,380
But he looks like a good boy.

757
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,420
You said it yourself, "looks like."

758
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,080
Back when he was in Korea,

759
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,060
he changed girlfriends faster than changing clothes,

760
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,790
but because

761
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,350
he never dated fans

762
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,910
and his acting skills were top-notch,

763
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,540
his fans never found out.

764
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,330
How do you know so much about him?

765
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,390
Because back when I was

766
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,950
with Team TAT in Korea,

767
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,210
he was already an intern for Team TAT.

768
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,760
So, it's not like what the media says,

769
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
that he joined after I left the team.

770
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,640
In other words, I'm his senior.

771
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,870
And that's exactly why

772
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,070
he wouldn't make a move on someone I'm dating.

773
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,800
That's what I said before, too.

774
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,350
Before you make up such a horrible reason,

775
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,970
couldn't you at least give me a heads-up?

776
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,770
With your kitten-like courage,

777
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,670
would giving you a heads-up even help?

778
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,880
After the heads-up, you'd be all claws trying to grab my phone

779
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,040
and then continue to be charmed by him,

780
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,070
ending up as his eighteenth concubine.

781
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,800
I get it, I get it. Stop talking.

782
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,610
The eggs are fried really well.

783
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,890
Your flowers.

784
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,490
Thank you.

785
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,070
Smiling!

786
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,230
Smiling!

787
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,070
Hello, everyone.

788
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,310
Welcome to

789
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,390
the 2020 OPL.

790
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,430
The teams participating in this match are

791
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,610
Team ZGDX and Team Arashi.

792
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,370
I'm sure everyone has been

793
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,310
eagerly anticipating this match.

794
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,110
Look, such a big bouquet of roses.

795
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,320
Smiling!

796
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,420
Is that person your blind date, Cheng?

797
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,310
I guess so.

798
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,120
Did you see that? Did you see that?

799
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,920
Yes, I saw it. It's Cheng's hand.

800
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,810
Just like during the livestream.

801
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,250
I knew something was going on between them.

802
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,000
I've known something was up between them for a while now.

803
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,610
Really?

804
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,170
If you dare to flirt with him again,

805
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,200
next time, I might have to French kiss you in front of him

806
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,930
to make him get rid of his ideas.

807
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,700
I wasn't flirting.

808
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,980
Do you think I'm blind?

809
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,100
Okay. Let go of my head first.

810
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,960
No, he's still watching.

811
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,720
You two are whispering behind my back again.

812
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,450
The match is about to start. Is this appropriate?

813
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,420
Some people are getting too cocky. They want to pick Mannendake.

814
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,770
I asked her if she still wanted to see tomorrow's sun.

815
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,100
Forget I said anything.

816
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,150
Cheng.

817
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:44,900
What?

818
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,870
You did that.

819
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,030
Won't your blind date get jealous?

820
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,660
No.

821
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,450
I've already turned her down.

822
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,810
But she said she won't give up.

823
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,950
She insists on giving it a try.

824
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,680
She doesn't even know what esports is.

825
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,810
What's there to try?

826
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,560
Finding a boyfriend isn't like finding a job.

827
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,180
Why does she need to know what esports is?

828
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,380
Because I'm willful.

829
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,200
Alright, the match is about to begin.

830
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,470
Now, we'll move on to the ban and pick phase.

831
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,870
Let's wait and see!
