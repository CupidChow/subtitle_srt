So in the team fights later,

00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,580

Why didn't you

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,620
tell us about this in advance?

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,000
Why didn't you discuss it with us?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,320
Is it that you didn't want to tell us,

13

or that you don't trust us,

Yao,

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,800
something so big happened to you recently.

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,270
And you're not going to tell us if we don't ask, are you?

Did you buy this?

103
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,740
We should've gotten a new computer a long time ago.

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,610
Dad,

109
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,600
you're actually watching a gaming livestream?

110
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,360
Yeah.

111
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,240
It's to keep up with your mom.

112
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,950
Your mom is really something now.

113
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,280

117
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,270
You're overthinking it.

118
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,640
There's been a promotion online recently

119

where you can trade in the old for a new one.

120
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,170
So, I traded in our old computer,

121
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
paid a little extra,

122
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,700
and got a new one.

123
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
What do you think?

124
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,520
So on trend?

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Can you teach me?

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,500
I've been thinking about getting a 5G phone.

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Look, 5G is different from the old one, right?

128
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,800
Dad.

129
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,060
Why didn't you set up the new computer and try it out?

130
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,440
The delivery came when I wasn't home.

131
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,780
I've scheduled it.

132
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,540

133
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,690
Don't wait for another day.

134
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680

135
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,730

141
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,560
What can you do?

142
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,910
I can't do anything.

143

Let me ask you,

144
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,800
did you and that Lu

145
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,830
get together from the beginning?

146
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,210
Back then, when your dad and I went to the base,

147
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,680
I noticed that the way

148
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,080
that kid looked at you

149
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,880
was different from other boys.

150
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,440
What look?

151
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,450
It's the kind of look that says,

152
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,360
"this thing is mine."

153
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,680
Understand?

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,960
Thing?

155
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,540
But last time you didn't really interact.

156
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,980
How did you know?

157
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,530
Of course I know.

158
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,480
I'm an old hand.

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,000
You think you can hide things from me?

160
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,840
Alright, alright, Mom. Stop it.

161
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,720
Alright, alright.

162

No matter how free and open

166
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,060
young people are nowadays,

167
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,280
you still need to be careful, especially as a girl.

168
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm nagging you

169
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,360
even though nothing has happened.

170
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,760
But if anything really does happen,

171
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,200
you must tell me.

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,040
I won't blame you.

173
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
I will help you.

174
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,780
So don't do anything reckless.

175
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,900
Promise me.

176
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,090
Okay, okay, Mom.

177
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,909
You're shy, huh?

178
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,929
-Go peel the garlic.
-Okay.

179
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
Have some tea.

180
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,120
Thank you, Mr. Tong.

181
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,050
Mr. Tong, have a seat.

182
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,490
It's all set. Have a look.

183
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,120
So soon?

184
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,800
Great.

185
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,630
It's so great.

186
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,990
Has Yao's hand gotten better?

187
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,410
Her hand is fine now.

188
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,640
Don't worry.

189
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,480
Our Yao appears to be carefree,

190
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,640
but actually, she's quite sensitive.

191
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,720
She never compromises.

192
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,480
When it comes to love,

193
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,780
she sees things as black or white.

194
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
Mr. Tong, I understand.

195
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,050
I don't oppose

196
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,020
the two of you being together.

197
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,790
But as her father,

198
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
I need to confirm with you face-to-face

199
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
whether you're serious.

200
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Have you thought about your future together,

201
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,850
or is this just a passing fancy?

202
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
I know,

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
pro players

204
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,880
have a lot of female fans,

205
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,040
especially someone like you.

206
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,120
If you have a careless attitude about this,

207
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,410
I won't agree to you two being together.

208
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,200
Let's be clear

209
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,150
about this from the start.

210
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,120
Do you really like my daughter?

211
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,360
I need you to confirm that.

212
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,920
Mr. Tong, don't worry.

213
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,800
I will take full responsibility for her.

214
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,560
After all,

215
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,440
I'll never find another girl

216
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,100
as wonderful as Tong Yao.

217
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,160
Good.

218
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,690
Cheng, what did you say to my dad?

219
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
What are you talking about?

220
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,640
I heard it.

221
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,920
What did you hear?

222
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,760
I heard you say it's hard to find a girl like me.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,920
And...

224
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,080
And?

225
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,560
And...

226
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,790
You said you'd take full responsibility for me.

227
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,600
What?

228
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,380
Come closer. I can't hear you.

229
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,800
I said, you said...

230
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,510
I will take full responsibility for you.

231
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Lu Sicheng,

232
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,510
even if I could find someone better than you

233
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,350
with a flashlight,

234
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,550
I still wouldn't.

235
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,500
You want to find someone better than me?

236
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,710
If you dare use a flashlight to look for someone else,

237
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,910
I'll burn down the factory that makes those flashlights.

238
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,250
Are you an alpha boss?

239
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,230
Yes, your alpha boss.

240
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,400
Honey,

241
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,920
why aren't you in bed yet?

242
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,040
Leave me alone.

243
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
It's still early.

244
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,420
Go and practice your shikigami.

245
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,500
I have to study.

246
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,640
Are you watching the video of the AD from the other team?

247
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,440
Stop it.

248
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,160
Let me ask you something serious.

249
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,400
Do you think you can still handle it at your age?

250
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,470
Why can't I?

251
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
What are you thinking about

252
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,510
every day?

253
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm asking,

254
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,240
playing professionally at your age,

255
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,420
how is your reaction speed

256
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,440
and control

257
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,250
compared to

258
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,670
when you were a teenager?

259
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,240
So that's what you're asking.

260
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
There have definitely been some changes.

261
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,580
That's why professional players

262
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,450
train even harder as they get older.

263
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,260
After all,

264
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,270
I'm not a young boy anymore.

265
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,020
So now I'm starting to plan

266
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,310
for the next batch of young boys to train.

267
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,450
What do you mean?

268
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
[Youth Esports Development Program]

269
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,480
What's wrong with you?

270
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,350
You stayed up all night?

271
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,000
I stayed up late last night researching.

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,680
And I was just waiting for a friend who has jet lag.

273
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Later,

274
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,150
I had a chat with an investor who just returned to the country,

275
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,010
and it sparked some inspiration.

276
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,540
I'm now working on a Youth Esports Development Program.

277
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,470
I'll show it to you when it's ready.

278
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,640
What?

279
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,290
I really didn't expect

280
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,720
that you were serious about

281
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,890
making esports your career.

282
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,290
Of course, I was serious.

283
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,120
It's good.

284
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,200
I noticed that

285
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,640
both of us have changed quite a lot over the past six months.

286
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,920
Yeah, we have.

287
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,760
In just half a year,

288
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,680
you've already got the esports heartthrob.

289
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Who was it

290
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,340
that said she would never date an esports player

291
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,780
and set the flag pretty high?

292
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,240
How dare you criticize me?

293
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,260
Who was it that claimed she'd never get along with the esports industry,

294
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,320
and now ended up eating her own words?

295
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,800
Alright.

296
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,880
Come on.

297
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,570
Jinyang.

298
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,140
The elimination rounds are coming.

299
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,660
We're going to face CK.

300
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,400
What? Are you nervous?

301
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,770
Not really.

302
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,120
It just feels like these past six months have been like a dream.

303
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,970
A year ago,

304
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,880
I was sitting in front of my computer, watching others play professionally,

305
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,480
sending out mocking comments in the live chat.

306
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,810
It hasn't been long since then,

307
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,800
and I've become the one being mocked.

308
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't worry.

309
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,160
If someone sends you

310
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,680
mocking comments,

311
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,030
it'll definitely be me.

312
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,480
Oh, right.

313
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,080
If six months ago,

314
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,280
I had treated that Rui,

315
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,680
who sent me the professional gaming invite,

316
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,920
as a scammer,

317
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,160
would I be here today?

318
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,950
Yes, you would.

319
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,480
It would just have happened

320
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,150
in a different way.

321
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,800
You're destined to shine

322
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,880
in this industry.

323
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,880
Really?

324
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,280
Just like I once imagined

325
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,800
countless possibilities for myself,

326
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,000
in the end,

327
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,550
I still ended up with Ai Jia.

328
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,470
It makes sense.

329
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,480
Sometimes,

330
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,690
life offers endless possibilities,

331
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,960
but there aren't as many "what ifs".

332
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
The path you choose,

333
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,740
whether the rewards outweigh the losses

334
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,160
or the hardships exceed the joys,

335
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,960
always carries its own meaning.

336
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,930
So, as long as you don't regret it, that's enough.

337
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
That's some philosophy, sis.

338
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Of course.

339
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,560
So, do you regret it?

340
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,490
No.

341
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,080
With Team CK's resounding victory,

342
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,800
the 2020 qualifiers

343
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,280
for the OPL National League

344
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,120
have officially concluded.

345
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,400
Now, all teams must begin preparing

346
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,380
for the upcoming matches.

347
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,220
From the results of the qualifiers,

348
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,690
it's clear that ZGDX, CK, and YQCB

349
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,930
are leading the pack.

350
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,130
These three teams, whether in terms of tactics

351
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,410
or starting lineups,

352
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,460
have clear counterbalancing relationships.

353
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,359
According to our previous analysis and predictions,

354
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,280
the first round of matches

355
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,440
should be relatively easy for these three strong teams.

356
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,609
ZGDX is expected to easily defeat Team Arashi,

357
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,250
and although CK will face

358
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,790
the traditional powerhouse FNC in the first round,

359
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,300
considering God Yang's performance in the qualifiers,

360
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,140
I'm betting on CK to win.

361
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,730
If CK manages to defeat FNC,

362
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,160
then ZGDX

363
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,610
will face their traditional rival, Team CK,

364
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,890
sooner than expected.

365
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,150
Team CK

366
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,370
is our old rival.

367
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,100
You're all familiar with their characteristics.

368
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,890
They are on par with us.

369
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,280
Especially God Yang,

370
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,480
since entering the elimination rounds,

371
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
his performance has been surprisingly good.

372
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,100
How do you feel?

373
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,540
Are you confident?

374
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,530
-Yes!
-Yes!

375
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,960
Why do I feel a bit nervous?

376
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,720
It's okay.

377
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,390
[Onmyoji Arena]

378
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,210
Are you nervous?

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,880
Stop biting.

380
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,790
Your lips are going to get hurt.

381
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,150
Is it better now?

382
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,320
I borrowed some lipstick from you.

383
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,090
Still feeling weak in the legs?

384
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,210
Do you want me to carry you?

385
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,530
I'm here.

386
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,400
Let's go.

387
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,330
Hello, everyone.

388
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,960
Welcome to

389
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,410
the match between Team CK

390
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,720
and Team ZGDX

391
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,580
at the National League of OPL.

392
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,490
I'm your commentator, Heng.

393
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,200
Hello, everyone.

394
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,800
I'm Shuo, the handsome commentator as always.

395
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,170
Now we can see

396
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,490
that both teams are in position,

397
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,020
and the ban and pick phase will begin shortly.

398
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,490
Ban Susabi, Tamamonomae,

399
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,810
and Shuten Doji.

400
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,770
Team CK banned

401
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,720
Susabi, Tamamonomae, and Shuten Doji.

402
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,620
It seems they are worried about the mid lane.

403
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,650
That's right. Looks like the opponent's mid laner is very strong.

404
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,250
Cat,

405
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,990
let's ban Aobozu and Satori.

406
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,760
Okay.

407
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,880
Then let's ban Yamakaze as well.

408
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,690
ZGDX banned

409
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,630
Satori, Yamakaze, and Aobozu.

410
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,600
Let's lock Ubume first.

411
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,000
Team CK has secured Ubume on the first pick.

412
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,810
Jian Yang took Ubume?

413
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
Good. He's afraid of death.

414
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,980
Do you have this written

415
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,180
in your girl's diary?

416
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,060
Can we please

417
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,210
put the girl's diary aside for now?

418
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,890
Jealousy should be kept for the right occasion, okay?

419
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,640
Tong Yao,

420
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,020
the opponent didn't ban Susabi.

421
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,220
Do you want to pick it?

422
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,920
Is Susabi good against Kiyohime?

423
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,470
It feels a bit difficult.

424
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,190
It's easy.

425
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,310
As long as Susabi's ID is Smiling.

426
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,760
Cheng, that's a bit too arrogant, don't you think?

427
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,400
Tong Yao,

428
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,690
Cheng has left you with no other options.

429
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,770
I'll order the Hero's Song for you.

430
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,320
Come on,

431
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,540
MC Cat, drop the beat.

432
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,600
The river flows eastward,

433
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,350
and the stars in the sky align with the Big Dipper.

434
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,400
The Big Dipper!

435
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,850
Everybody, follow me!

436
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,250
When we see injustice, we shout out loud.

437
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,320
When it's time to act, we act.

438
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,880
Bold and fiery...

439
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,340
Do you want to be on the in-game quotes again?

440
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,210
What a boring man.

441
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,850
Cheng, Pang,

442
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,560
you need to lock Hannya and Yasha

443
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,720
for Cat and K.

444
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,680
-Okay.
-Their top laner is Hannya, and jungler is Yasha.

445
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,880
For mid lane, they picked Susabi.

446
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,760
The bot lane duo

447
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,610
is Youko and Ichimokuren.

448
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,370
On CK's side,

449
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,130
their top laner is Ibaraki Doji,

450
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,430
jungler is Ubume,

451
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,820
mid laner is Kiyohime, AD is Chin,

452
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,840
and support is Kuro.

453
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,850
Go, go, go!

454
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,790
Come on, everyone!

455
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,470
Come on!

456
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,080
God Ming, walk slower.

457
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,340
Be careful not to trip.

458
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,850
God Yang is coming to the top lane.

459
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,530
Be careful in the top lane. Their jungler is coming over.

460
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,030
Then why aren't you coming to protect me?

461
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,890
Didn't we agree to step in when we see injustice?

462
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,390
But I didn't see any injustice.

463
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm coming too.

464
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,200
When it's time to act, we act.

465
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,560
Let's do a top-mid-jungle coordination.

466
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,920
Okay.

467
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,640
As expected, it's K who's most concerned about Cat.

468
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,100
We can't escape now, guys.

469
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,240
ZGDX's top-mid-jungle coordination

470
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,600
-Retreat.
-has started countering God Yang and Luck.

471
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,520
-I'm retreating, I'm retreating.
-Back up a little.

472
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,670
God Yang and Luck are low on HP.

473
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,840
-They used blink.
-Both the top laner and jungler used their blink.

474
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,660
You don't have to come.

475
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,800
Nice, those little legs sure run fast.

476
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,220
We don't kill those who use blink. It's a rule.

477
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,160
Alright. They won't be able to farm this wave of minions.

478
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,880
A huge loss.

479
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,770
He doesn't have blink.

480
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,910
For now, we don't need to worry about God Yang ganking.

481
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,850
Cheng can now bully Butterfly without worry.

482
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,500
Yes.

483
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,030
Now I feel comfortable.

484
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,820
Why did you make dirty jokes during the match?

485
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,300
I was just talking normally.

486
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,410
Well, that's because you have the face of a pervert.

487
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,350
When you talk, it feels like you're being a pervert.

488
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,520
When you're not talking,

489
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,450
it looks like you're planning something perverted.

490
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,630
I'm level 6.

491
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,450
I'll teleport to the bot lane.

492
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,850
Kiyohime's level 6. Be careful.

493
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,520
Floret's level 6.

494
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,640
He teleported straight to the bottom lane to support.

495
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,240
Retreat! Come with me, Pang.

496
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,200
Retreat!

497
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,090
Block it for me.

498
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,560
God Yang's also arrived.

499
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,080
It's 4v2. Chessman and Pang are in danger.

500
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,740
Pang blocked the damage for Chessman

501
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,000
and got killed! But at least Chessman was saved.

502
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
-Nice! Not bad.
-That was close.

503
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,250
Floret made a pretty decisive move to the bot lane.

504
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,020
It's okay.

505
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,200
Our mid laner is still in the top lane.

506
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,880
Pang, you have a strong sense of the bigger picture.

507
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,840
It's okay, Pang.

508
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,400
We still love you.

509
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,670
Come on, let's take a look at the top lane.

510
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,870
Smiling is moving in.

511
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,600
Tower dive!

512
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,560
I'm dead.

513
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,050
This revenge is worth it.

514
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,080
Nice. No loss.

515
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,560
We lost a support and killed a top laner.

516
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,690
You're not at a loss,

517
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,450
but my mid lane minion wave...

518
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,860
I'm struggling.

519
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,080
Their mid laner, Floret, disappeared from the lane.

520
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,340
Be careful of the bush.

521
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,920
The bottom laner is also missing.

522
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,160
I'll push the mid lane to their tower.

523
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,190
Cat, retreat.

524
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,140
-Retreat!
-What did I find?

525
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,760
The other four members of CK are all in the top lane.

526
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,470
Cat didn't notice at all

527
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,840
and got killed instantly!

528
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,400
Nice!

529
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,330
They're targeting me too much because I'm too handsome.

530
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,330
You must have some misunderstanding about yourself.

531
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,380
It was so obvious, but he got killed so easily.

532
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,930
Cat really is getting older.

533
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,260
He's getting slower.

534
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,890
I'm not talking about you.

535
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,170
Let me take a look.

536
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,730
The kill count is 4-2.

537
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,690
We're ahead by two kills,

538
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,700
but our gold is still lower than CK's.

539
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,410
What a loss.

540
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,230
It'd be great if we could take Orochi now.

541
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,910
Come on, let's camp by Orochi's pit.

542
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm coming, Cheng.

543
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,680
Cat,

544
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,740
ult and go straight in!

545
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,940
-Okay!
-CK is about to lose this Orochi!

546
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,960
Be careful!

547
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,670
God Yang can't use any skills!

548
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,760
-God Yang!
-God Yang!

549
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,090
God Yang got killed!

550
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,720
Now it's up to Wang!

551
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,160
Wang got killed too!

552
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,290
Floret got killed as well!

553
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,640
That was some clutch gameplay!

554
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,780
That's right. That was amazing!

555
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,700
Get Orochi!

556
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,080
ZGDX successfully got the Orochi!

557
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,640
Nice!

558
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,440
God Yang and Luck recalled with low HP.

559
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,150
This is what we call

560
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,400
the coordination of a top-tier team.

561
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,820
Whether it's CK's mid lane

562
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,110
or ZGDX's split strategy to steal resources,

563
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,180
it was really spectacular. Very spectacular!

564
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,520
-Full team engage!
-Not bad, K.

565
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,280
Engage!

566
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,900
Hit the tower. Hit the tower.

567
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,840
-Go, go, go!
-ZGDX has already started pushing mid.

568
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,950
It looks like CK has no way to turn this around.

569
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,410
It looks like it's going to be the final push.

570
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,760
They've taken it down!

571
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,320
Congrats to ZGDX for winning this match!

572
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,730
Yes! Yes! Yes!

573
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Alright, I got it.

574
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,020
I'm playing a match right now.

575
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,700
Okay, I'll call you later.

576
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,440
Cheng, what a coincidence.

577
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,920
Last time, you were also hiding here eating candy.

578
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,520
Yeah.

579
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,170
Last time, you were arguing with my girlfriend.

580
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,240
Well, since that's the case,

581
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,520
when we meet on the battlefield next time,

582
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,960
I won't hold back.

583
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,050
Alright, see you on the battlefield.

584
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,040
At that time, I was wondering

585
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,440
who that fierce girl was.

586
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,520
I didn't expect her to become my teammate later,

587
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,200
and even more unexpectedly, she became my...

588
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,080
At that time, I just found out she was going pro.

589
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,120
I was so surprised.

590
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,480
Actually, we hadn't been in touch for a long time after breaking up,

591
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,340
and I never expected her to go pro.

592
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,380
Honestly, I never intended

593
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,510
to break up with her.

594
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,520
So, I should thank you for letting her go.

595
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,450
Otherwise, how would I have had the chance to step in?

596
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,260
Good luck in the next game.

597
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,100
I lost to you guys in the Spring Finals.

598
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,360
I'm not planning to lose again this year.

599
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,040
By the way,

600
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,740
don't tell her I'm eating candy.

601
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,200
It doesn't match my image.

602
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,760
I know you still have her on WeChat.

603
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,570
Lu Sicheng, were you secretly eating candy?

604
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,430
No. Stop falsely accusing me.

605
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,640
-You definitely were.
-I wasn't.

606
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,840
-You were.
-I wasn't.

607
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,160
-You were.
-I wasn't.

608
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,760
Open your mouth.

609
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,380
Open your mouth and let me smell it.

610
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,240
Your mouth smells like strawberry.

611
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,840
-I can smell it.
-It doesn't.

612
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,260
In this match,

613
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,670
the key point is the synergy between mid and jungle.

614
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,300
The mid laner and jungler must always be ready

615
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,350
to support

616
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,920
when fights break out on the lanes.

617
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,360
Because we need to create a situation where we have the advantage in numbers.

618
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,000
With the tactics I planned,

619
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,920
we'll definitely crush ZGDX, okay?

620
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,330
Okay, come on.

621
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,560
One, two, three!

622
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
Go! Let's go.

623
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,570
Let's go.

624
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,470
Floret,

625
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,620
you need to be careful.

626
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,510
Tong Yao might pick

627
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,150
Tamamonomae for the next game to teach you a lesson.

628
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,650
Don't mention Tamamonomae to me.

629
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,180
I'm under a lot of pressure.

630
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,520
We're definitely banning it next game.

631
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,110
God Yang, what will you pick next game?

632
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,890
Ubume.

633
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,260
What are we banning?

634
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,490
Ban Youko.

635
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,820
Youko? Okay, I'll ban it.

636
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,650
Do it.

637
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Youko was banned.

638
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,430
What should Cheng pick?

639
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,530
Jikikaeru.

640
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,650
What are you talking about?

641
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,540
What else could you pick?

642
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,410
Dodomeki? Chin? Komatsu?

643
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,350
Or Kubinashi?

644
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,290
A liar doesn't deserve to pick these shikigamis.

645
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,450
When did I lie?

646
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,420
You said you quit candy.

647
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,120
I didn't eat candy just now.

648
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,910
Your mouth smells like strawberry.

649
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,830
You're trying too hard to cover it up.

650
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,050
Which lady gave you candy

651
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,650
when you went to the restroom?

652
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,850
Come on, spill the beans.

653
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,820
I don't have diabetes.

654
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,880
Why should I be so strict with myself?

655
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,490
Mr. Recorder in the back,

656
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,480
don't put this part in the in-game quotes.

657
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:49,950
Okay.

658
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:50,680
Why?

659
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,860
I'm afraid that you, the new team bully,

660
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,480
might receive another razor blade.

661
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,570
So thoughtful?

662
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,450
Of course.

663
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,560
K, lock Shuten Doji for Cat.

664
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,270
Okay.

665
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,040
I'll pick Onikiri.

666
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,350
Are you sure?

667
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,050
Cheng, they picked Onikiri.

668
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,560
They dared to pick Onikiri?

669
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,980
Isn't Luck

670
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,150
supposed to be good with tank-type shikigamis?

671
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,220
Why did he pick Onikiri to scare me?

672
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,140
Lu Yue could pick Menreiki.

673
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,490
What's the big deal?

674
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,280
Every time we talk badly about Lu Yue,

675
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,940
God Ming laughs the happiest.

676
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,300
Why do I suddenly feel a bit sorry for Lu Yue?

677
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,660
I'll bet ten hamburgers

678
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,230
that Lu Yue is scratching the wall right now.

679
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,670
Pang, you should pick Kuro.

680
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,480
Okay.

681
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,650
Alright, both teams have finished the ban and pick.

682
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,440
The match officially begins.

683
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,210
K, keep an eye on the top lane this game.

684
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,300
I have a feeling that Luck picked Onikiri

685
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,330
for a reason.

686
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,330
Okay.

687
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,280
Come on.

688
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,000
Killing this squishy Onikiri

689
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,520
should be easy, right?

690
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,100
Come on.

691
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,320
-Coming.
-K is in the top lane now.

692
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
Here we go. Two against one.

693
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,910
The gank should be a sure thing.

694
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,720
Trying to escape?

695
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,120
Luck charged to the tower

696
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,700
and locked down Cat!

697
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,720
-Congratulations to CK for getting First Blood!
-Lost again, huh?

698
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,320
This is a counter-kill.

699
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,390
There's something wrong with my mouse.

700
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,840
Nice! Who can stop me?

701
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,510
Watch me.

702
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,240
Luck is in the bush, preparing to recall and restore health.

703
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,500
K seems to have noticed

704
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,210
and is preparing to take out Luck, who's low on health.

705
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,120
He got killed!

706
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,240
Zero for two. Nice!

707
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,100
Nice!

708
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,830
God Yang! God Yang! God Yang!

709
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,300
They got wiped!

710
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,120
I have to say

711
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,720
since Luck picked Onikiri,

712
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,340
he's been unstoppable.

713
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,460
Yes.

714
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,480
ZGDX just can't hold up.

715
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,580
Now the economy difference is getting bigger and bigger.

716
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,980
It's okay. Keep going. We can still fight.

717
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,140
You...

718
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,490
You made a god in the top lane.

719
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,560
Cat, K, after clearing the top lane minion wave,

720
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,240
come down.

721
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,160
Okay.

722
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,220
Tong Yao, get ready.

723
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,720
I'll come after I clean the wave.

724
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,080
Pang, let's push the wave to the front

725
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
and then go for Orochi.

726
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,610
Okay.

727
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,710
Go! I'll protect you!

728
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,780
Go! There's a battle over Orochi's pit!

729
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,660
Kill Onikiri!

730
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,430
We can see ZGDX is focusing on killing Onikiri!

731
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,490
ZGDX is focusing on killing Onikiri!

732
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,190
They got killed!

733
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,120
Double kill! Nice!

734
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,120
It looks like this time they can't turn it around.

735
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,390
Triple kill! So amazing!

736
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Amazing!

737
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,920
The final push!

738
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,640
Hit it! Go, go, go!

739
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,890
CK's winning a sure thing now.

740
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,100
CK has pushed into ZGDX's base.

741
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,480
They've taken it down!

742
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,620
Congrats to CK for winning this match!

743
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,890
Congratulations, CK!

744
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,830
Good job!

745
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,140
Nice! Well played!

746
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,410
I don't understand the damage from their Onikiri.

747
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,280
Alright, stop thinking about it.

748
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,480
It's a bit fake.

749
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,050
Cheng, what are you thinking?

750
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,030
I'm thinking...

751
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,880
if it weren't for me trash talking to Jian Yang,

752
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,680
we might not have lost this game.

753
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,410
Just a reminder,

754
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840
it's 1-1 right now.

755
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,010
We haven't lost yet.

756
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,660
But what do you mean by trash talking?

757
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,190
When did you meet Jian Yang?

758
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,740
Earlier, during the break,

759
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,610
in the safe passage near the restroom.

760
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,360
Weren't you insisting you didn't eat any candy?

761
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,820
From now on, you're not allowed to go to the restroom without permission.

762
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,240
You have to report it first and get approval before going.

763
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,280
Ma'am.

764
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,040
What?

765
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:26,860
I need to pee.

766
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,500
Luck's Onikiri made me so angry that my bladder hurts.

767
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,300
You can't go.

768
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,120
Let's go over the last match.

769
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,680
Cat,

770
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,670
didn't you say that Shuten Doji becomes unstoppable once he gets enough economy?

771
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,520
That's nonsense.

772
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,440
There's still Onikiri.

773
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,720
I...

774
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,220
Look at Luck's Onikiri.

775
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,580
Why can't you do that?

776
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,420
Why?

777
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,830
Tong Yao, let him go to the restroom.

778
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,300
Let this mad dog go.

779
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,810
Don't you want to go to the restroom?

780
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,280
Come over, I'll check

781
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,780
if you're hiding any candy.

782
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Hands on the wall.

783
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,120
Legs apart.

784
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,179
Are there any hidden in your shoes?

785
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,780
Why don't you come with me?

786
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,440
That way you can supervise me.

787
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,580
Pervert!

788
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,510
What are you looking at?

789
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,880
I didn't dare to speak loudly just now.

790
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,949
Before, every time we lost a match,

791
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,080
Cheng would always have a stern face.

792
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,699
Anyone who dared to speak would be seen as not reflecting on themselves

793
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,850
and would be dragged out for a "public execution."

794
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,100
But this time, there's nothing to worry about.

795
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,380
He's in a good mood.

796
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,639
It's like he received a million-yuan bribe

797
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,840
from Team CK for match-fixing.

798
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,000
You've worked hard.

799
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
I think so too.

800
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,320
Here we are in the 2020

801
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,400
National League of OPL,

802
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,650
the third match between Team CK

803
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,040
and Team ZGDX.

804
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,690
The ban and pick phase has just ended,

805
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,530
and the game is about to start.

806
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,270
The mid laners of both teams are now facing off.

807
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,060
Susabi, this shikigami,

808
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,850
might be at a bit of a disadvantage

809
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,080
in the early game against Tamamo-no-Mae.

810
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,150
But if Smiling

811
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,640
can get a few kills,

812
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,480
then Susabi

813
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,340
can easily take control of the game.

814
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,680
God Yang is farming in the upper jungle.

815
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,940
And over on ZGDX's side,

816
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,920
K will reach level 4 after finishing this Kirin.

817
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,950
With that, no matter whether he goes to the mid or bottom lane...

818
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,420
K, how much longer are you going to farm?

819
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,840
Come to the bottom lane and prepare to gank.

820
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,360
I feel like Jian Yang is coming.

821
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,160
Okay.

822
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,460
K finished farming and is already waiting in the bottom lane bush.

823
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,110
Pang, take a step forward.

824
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,120
-Coming.
-Looks like the bottom lane is going to get exciting again.

825
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,040
-Yes, God Yang's Yasha has been worn down.
-Pang.

826
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,260
-Fight!
-K showed up!

827
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
K, finish him! Don't let him escape!

828
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,170
K's "killing two birds with one stone"

829
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,550
took down God Yang.

830
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,600
It's fine, it's fine.

831
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,040
You all fall back.

832
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,830
Nice!

833
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,120
Smiling used her full skill combo plus Corrosion

834
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,380
to take Floret down right as he used his ultimate

835
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,380
and got a solo kill.

836
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,330
Seeing this,

837
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,040
I guess that both the fans

838
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,400
watching the live stream

839
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,530
and those at the live event for Team ZGDX

840
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,700
can now rest easy.

841
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,580
The fact that Smiling didn't compete recently

842
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,910
hasn't affected her performance one bit.

843
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,010
Wang, come with me.

844
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,040
Let's head to the mid lane.

845
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,420
If we don't gank her now, it'll be hard to win.

846
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,090
Both carries have one kill each.

847
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,960
They've taken all the vision control.

848
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,770
Pang, K,

849
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,040
why don't you get some too?

850
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,600
Okay.

851
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,690
Be quiet.

852
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,560
Let me finish taking the gold and experience first.

853
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,530
They're doing that because they're afraid of getting ganked.

854
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,330
Worst case, just let K keep ganking the top lane

855
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,400
and not go to the mid lane.

856
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,960
Anyway, God Yang isn't willing to gank you.

857
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,350
Pang, you're quite bold now.

858
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,980
Be careful, or Cheng will kill you.

859
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,010
You talk so much.

860
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,380
Why don't you take some vision control?

861
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,150
I won't.

862
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,340
I'm poor. I need to farm.

863
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,650
You're so stingy even when we have the advantage.

864
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,500
How are we supposed to win if we're at a disadvantage?

865
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,800
You actually said God Yang wouldn't come to mid.

866
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,660
I don't think he's the type who...

867
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,770
God Yang, clear the minion wave.

868
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,540
Why are you laughing?

869
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,440
All the fans

870
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,270
in the arena heard your scream.

871
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,380
No way.

872
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,840
Just now, I heard a female scream

873
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,470
coming from ZGDX's area.

874
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,310
It was earth-shattering!

875
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,440
No wonder they say ZGDX's game bully has changed.

876
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,140
That's right.

877
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,600
Let's go for Orochi.

878
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,240
Okay.

879
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,040
Cat, K, cover the top side of the pit.

880
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,060
Tong Yao, go to the left side.

881
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,630
Pang, go in the pit with me.

882
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,680
Coming.

883
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,410
-Let's go!
-ZGDX is starting Orochi!

884
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,100
They're starting Orochi.

885
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,830
No rush. They're not that fast.

886
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,050
Let's group up first.

887
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,320
-I'll be right there.
-Okay.

888
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,840
God Yang is signaling to group up.

889
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,410
Be careful. They're coming.

890
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,010
Are we still going for it? My suppression's not ready yet.

891
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,190
If they steal it, it'll be really bad.

892
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,790
Let's go, let's go. Retreat.

893
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
Save your skills.

894
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,060
Let's wait in the bush

895
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,790
and try to ambush them.

896
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,800
This Orochi attempt was a bit rushed.

897
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,360
No!

898
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,440
They didn't recall!

899
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,210
They're ambushing in the jungle.

900
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,720
But in the jungle, CK is at a disadvantage

901
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,280
-if a fight breaks out.
-Go!

902
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,110
A fight has started.

903
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,120
God Yang got ambushed.

904
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,160
I think I got ambushed. Butterfly!

905
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,760
I'm fighting, I'm fighting!

906
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,280
Wang was controlled by Smiling!

907
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,550
I got killed. Wang, where are you?

908
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,600
I got controlled.

909
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,480
He was killed!

910
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,060
Floret, chase!

911
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,140
Pang, ult.

912
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,940
Coming!

913
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,320
Butterfly's in danger.

914
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,430
Double kill.

915
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,410
Didn't expect that, huh, my friend?

916
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,770
Luck also got killed!

917
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,200
Now it's all up to Floret.

918
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,160
Can Floret escape?

919
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,940
Cover the back!

920
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,550
Floret!

921
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,720
Floret got taken down too.

922
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,080
God Yang, hurry up, don't get wiped.

923
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,880
This play was so sick.

924
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,280
Don't chase anymore, there's a minion wave in the mid lane.

925
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,040
Push it up, and this will be the final push.

926
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,880
Okay.

927
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,080
The final push! Come on.

928
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,040
Now we can see

929
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,020
ZGDX has already pushed onto high ground.

930
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,670
Only God Yang remains on the opposing side.

931
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,530
Looks like this is the final push!

932
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,040
God Yang is all alone, unable to turn things around!

933
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,000
But God Yang went up!

934
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,120
-He's trying to turn the game around!
-Okay. Go!

935
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,460
Hit the base, don't mind him.

936
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,880
Alright. Just hit the base.

937
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
The base! Come on!

938
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,490
It's about to explode! Hurry, hurry!

939
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,880
-It's exploded!
-Congratulations to Team ZGDX for living up to the expectations

940
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,720
and advancing to the top four in the National League!

941
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,630
Congratulations for advancing to the top four in the National League!

942
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,550
Great!

943
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,370
We turned the game around! We won!

944
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,190
Nice!

945
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,150
We won!

946
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,560
You did a great job using the blink and ult.

947
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,100
Let's go.

948
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,270
Congratulations.

949
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,000
Congratulations.

950
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,900
Congratulations.

951
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,390
Good job.

952
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,470
Congratulations.

953
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,320
I finally know the reason

954
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,410
you said we're not suited for each other that day.

955
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,610
I wish you happiness.

956
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,810
I told you we'd shake hands again.

957
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,410
See? I really came, didn't I?

958
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,110
Good luck.

959
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,710
Hope to see you again on the World Championship stage.

960
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,090
Alright, see you at the World Championship.

961
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:46,950
It's a promise.

962
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,420
Let's go.
