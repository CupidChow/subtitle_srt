1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,310
[On Tong Yao’s first day at the base, Lu Sicheng drove a luxury car to take her grocery shopping.]

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,310
[Tong Yao joined ZGDX with bad intentions—just to seduce Lu Sicheng]

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,910
[It was her first day and she had the captain take her shopping in an Aston Martin. That's her level]

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,910
[Take note, this was Schemer Tong's first day at the ZGDX training base]

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,230
[In front of God Yang, I found her really manipulative already]

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,230
[What a bitch, when she was sucking up to Cheng]

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,150
[Yes, it's disgusting. She found a new flame and forgot the old one. This woman is something else]

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,619
[The cat is well-behaved! So am I!]

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,070
[No need for me to remind everyone, right? In ancient times, this would definitely be an imperial consort-level move. ]

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,070
[Not long after joining the team, during a ranked match, we saw how Schemer Tong fawned over Lu Sicheng. ]

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,630
[Don’t put all the blame on the woman— it takes two to tango!]

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:49,910
[If Lu Sicheng were a gentleman, could Schemer Tong force him to kiss her?]

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:49,910
[Yeah. One is slutty, the other is cheap—they're a perfect match.]

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,590
[From then on, the king neglected his duties: the carries fell in love, the jungler and top laner started having conflicts]

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,590
[Step by step, she got close to Lu Sicheng and eventually won his heart. Schemer Tong finally achieved her goal.]

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,510
[Can Team ZGDX still make it to the national finals this year?]

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,550
[ZGDX is doomed. Mark my words.]

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:16,150
[After being crushed by Alpha, they suffered their first loss. At this rate, ZGDX can forget about winning the championship this season.]

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:16,150
[Since Schemer Tong's rise, ZGDX's standards have dropped significantly—what a coincidence.]

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:22,270
[Everyone, switch allegiance to other teams. Why support a team with an ADC and mid laner who are too focused on romance?]

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,740
[I really wish Tong Yao had never joined Team ZGDX]

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,740
[Sigh. The tyrant captain and Schemer Tong's love story—what a pity for ZGDX's long-standing golden reputation. ]

23
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,160
[Falling into your smile]

24
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,870
[Episode 26]

25
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,120
Let me discuss with the company

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,250
to take down all these negative posts.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,530
Everyone,

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,079
stop using your phones.

29
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,230
No Weibo,

30
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,780
no Esports Farm, no forums,

31
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,600
nothing.

32
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,990
This is for everyone's good.

33
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,740
Spend less time online.

34
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,200
Focus on the competition.

35
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,520
Don't read nonsense.

36
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,810
Otherwise, it’ll affect your mindset during the match.

37
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,390
Whether or not we check our phones doesn’t matter,

38
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,310
as long as we win the next match.

39
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,980
Then they will shut up.

40
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,710
Esports is played with hands,

41
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,570
not with words.

42
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,950
Understand?

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,490
Kubinashi is not online.

44
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,750
Tong Yao, clear the wave and head to the enemy's jungle.

45
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,410
Roger that.

46
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,070
Currently, the score is 1:0.

47
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,110
Can ZGDX, who won the first round,

48
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,110
ride the momentum, push forward,

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,590
and win the competition?

50
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,510
As we can see,

51
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,430
both teams are engaged in lane trades.

52
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,470
This time, ZGDX

53
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,230
is playing more steadily compared to the last game.

54
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,070
Yes. I wonder how FNATIC will respond?

55
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,430
In the last game,

56
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,310
Smiling's plays were incredible.

57
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,430
Her opponents had no chance at all.

58
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,150
The four FNATIC players were caught off guard

59
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,860
and their HP bars were gone in an instant.

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,350
No wonder Smiling is the Mage Queen, she lives up to her name.

61
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,110
It seems today might be her battlefield.

62
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,550
Yes.

63
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,230
Team up.

64
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,420
Let’s go for a small team fight.

65
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,270
Coming. Okay, got it.

66
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,590
Team, go. Pang, carry.

67
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,910
Nice!

68
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,990
Pull back.

69
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,550
Chase.

70
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,380
Pang, follow me.

71
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,170
I'm coming.

72
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,390
What did I say?

73
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,980
Today’s battlefield definitely belongs to Smiling.

74
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,910
In that last team wipe, not only did she protect Chessman,

75
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,510
but also secured some kills.

76
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,790
Alright, let’s congratulate ZGDX

77
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,230
on winning another round.

78
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,560
A big thanks to ZGDX’s

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,030
flawless duo carry

80
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,870
for giving us such an exciting match.

81
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,820
That's right. The three core early-game items

82
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,510
didn’t disappoint us at all.

83
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,550
Let's congratulate Team ZGDX again

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,830
for winning the competition.

85
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,890
Congratulations.

86
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,270
Let's go.

87
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,850
Let’s go.

88
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,580
Congratulations to Team ZGDX

89
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,070
for securing the victory without any major upsets.

90
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,530
Congratulations to Smiling for

91
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,230
being named MVP
for two consecutive rounds.

92
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,830
Thank you.

93
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,390
So how does it feel to be back

94
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,230
in the group-stage battles?

95
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,320
Pretty good.

96
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,810
There was a lot of noise online previously,

97
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,380
everyone was a little down and nervous.

98
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,500
I believe this match will help ease those feelings.

99
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,350
We noticed

100
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,310
some adjustments

101
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,970
to ZGDX’s gameplay this week.

102
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,070
It seems Cheng is no longer the only commander.

103
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,190
Did you make any adjustments

104
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,310
in this aspect?

105
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,180
Yes, we made some changes,

106
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,159
we’re still working on it.

107
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,760
Everyone is very motivated.

108
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,370
Are you changing commanders?

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,620
Our Captain Daddy is still our Captain Daddy.

110
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,030
If we want to change commanders,

111
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,090
you’d have to step over his dead body.

112
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,640
Recently, the backlash from

113
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,590
the ZGDX captain's response to fans has stirred up a lot of controversy online.

114
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,190
We know

115
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,090
this has also caused you to face significant criticism.

116
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,030
Do you have anything

117
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,310
you’d like to say to your teammates and fans regarding this?

118
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,940
Two MVPs,

119
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,020
just to ask this question, right?

120
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,430
Smiling, keep going!

121
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,680
-We’ll always support you.
-You’re the best.

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,470
Come on, Smiling.

123
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,190
We will always have your back.

124
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,350
You're the best.

125
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,900
Come on, Smiling. Smiling is the best!

126
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,210
I don’t know

127
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,830
what identity I should use

128
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,560
to answer this question today.

129
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,900
After playing half a season of matches

130
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,030
and being teammates for half a season,

131
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,970
I think I know what Lu Sicheng

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,159
from ZGDX

133
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,150
truly wants.

134
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,500
I believe everyone here knows too.

135
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,980
One day,

136
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,330
to stand on the world stage

137
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,610
draped in the five-starred red flag,

138
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,150
to lift that championship trophy we dream of.

139
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,060
Until then

140
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,310
even if we are covered in thorns

141
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,040
or treading on burning sands,

142
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,390
as the captain of ZGDX,

143
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,960
he carries the hopes and expectations of everyone.

144
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,750
He should bear it,

145
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,600
he's willing to bear it,

146
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,540
and he must bear it.

147
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,060
Some fans out there,

148
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,960
your desire to protect Lu Sicheng

149
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,150
is something we can understand.

150
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,390
But in esports,

151
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,140
without results, we have nothing.

152
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,450
The player you admire,

153
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,800
is it the one who shines on stage,

154
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,820
or is it just someone tall

155
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,850
and handsome?

156
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,180
You need to make that distinction.

157
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,710
I know that

158
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,110
the Internet has never been friendly

159
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,470
to women in esports.

160
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,190
Many girls are working hard to change this.

161
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,200
But I want to ask you.

162
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,850
While we’re grinding ranks, practicing,

163
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,909
watching matches,

164
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,440
and analyzing gameplays,

165
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,230
what are you doing?

166
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,230
Alright, that’s all I’ll say.

167
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,030
If I keep talking, I’ll just get scolded again.

168
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,440
But if you were

169
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,360
offended by anything I said,

170
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
I don’t regret it.

171
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,630
Thank you.

172
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,970
She's quite brave.

173
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,230
I think what she said makes a lot of sense.

174
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,620
Why are you here?

175
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,810
You scared me.

176
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,710
Why do you think I'm here?

177
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,809
You’re drenched in sweat.

178
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,429
If you don’t have the guts, don’t say things like that.

179
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,980
You said it and now you're scared.

180
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,789
You looked like you’d trip over yourself when you left the stage just now.

181
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,909
Stop it.

182
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,480
Who am I doing this for?

183
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,790
Actually, after

184
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,320
saying all that on stage,

185
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,430
I was really afraid you’d scold me.

186
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,070
Why?

187
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,300
Because after the show girl incident,

188
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,800
I promised you I’d behave better.

189
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
Now I’ve gone and caused trouble again.

190
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,600
Your awareness is impressive.

191
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,230
Yeah.

192
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,050
But

193
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,190
I'll forgive you this time.

194
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,150
It’s already not easy for girls

195
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,090
to play professionally in the esports scene.

196
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,970
Come on, sis!

197
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,420
Everyone should be more understanding towards sis.

198
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,980
Guang,

199
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,700
there’s been a lot of criticism online about Smiling recently.

200
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,430
What are your thoughts on this?

201
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,700
Smiling is a really good person.

202
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,750
Those who criticize her

203
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,110
will probably never know,

204
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,520
nor do they want to know, how good she is.

205
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,610
Smiling is an excellent professional player.

206
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,090
And I emphasize – she's a professional player.

207
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,170
Who’s badmouthing Smiling?

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,930
What do I say?

209
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,230
What can I say?

210
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,470
I advise everyone

211
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,420
to stop projecting your own negativity onto others.

212
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,270
Also, don’t come into my livestream

213
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,550
or any of our team’s livestreams

214
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,790
to stir up trouble about Smiling.

215
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,790
If you don't understand the game,

216
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,120
don't talk nonsense and embarrass yourself, okay?

217
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,450
There will be no badmouthing of Smiling in my stream.

218
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,910
It’s pointless. I’ll ban you.

219
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,030
Not allowed. Forbidden. Banned.

220
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,590
Me speaking up for her

221
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,230
has nothing to do with the past.

222
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,770
It has nothing to do with her gender.

223
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,160
Mind your own business

224
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,430
before worrying about others.

225
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,570
If you want to go against her,

226
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,960
then stop following me too.

227
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,640
The achievements she has today

228
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,470
are the results of her own hard work.

229
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,820
You don't have to like her,

230
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,120
but most of us on the team

231
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,550
deeply respect her as a competitor.

232
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,550
Even if you don’t like her, please respect her.

233
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,470
Respect everything

234
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,180
she has given for this esports dream.

235
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,980
Nothing else.

236
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,360
One day,

237
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,630
he can stand on the top of that stage

238
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,710
and raise the championship trophy we’ve dreamed of.

239
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,590
Until then,

240
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,440
even if we are covered in thorns

241
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,100
or treading on burning sands,

242
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,150
as the captain of ZGDX,

243
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,830
he carries

244
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,890
everyone's expectations and trust.

245
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,080
He's willing to bear it.

246
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
He should bear it,

247
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,330
and he has to bear it.

248
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,310
What a great speech.

249
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,750
Very touching.

250
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,350
I was deeply inspired.

251
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,840
Don’t worry.

252
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,080
Unfortunately, it's not ZGDX

253
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,950
that's standing on the national finals podium.

254
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,850
But remember,

255
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,040
I will raise that trophy for Cheng.

256
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,680
Jealousy won’t help you improve.

257
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,750
Instead of talking here,

258
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,680
why not spend that time improving?

259
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,950
Got that?

260
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,170
My wife’s words may be blunt, but they make sense.

261
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,480
Interview?

262
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,360
I’ve seen it.

263
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,340
She’s a very charming woman.

264
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,220
That's why

265
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,070
Lu Sicheng is...

266
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,010
How do you say it?

267
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,930
His ancestors’ graves are smoking with fortune.

268
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,540
Yes.

269
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,070
That's it.

270
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,960
His ancestors’ graves...

271
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,980
That's it.

272
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,990
Guys, let me tell you.

273
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,060
Our relationship with ZGDX

274
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,400
is very peaceful.

275
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
Don't worry about it.

276
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,570
Whatever Tong Yao says, is the official stance,

277
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,210
even down to the punctuation marks.

278
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,440
If you want to insist that our relationship

279
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,830
isn’t friendly, that’s fine,

280
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,470
It won't affect us at all.

281
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,830
Whether it's fans,

282
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,740
or haters waiting to be proven wrong.

283
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
On the national stage,

284
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,390
we will definitely

285
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,710
give you a satisfactory answer.

286
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,480
Yes.

287
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,470
Everything that needs to be said has been said.

288
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,310
The hardships we’ve endured

289
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,260
will become illuminate our path forward.

290
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,990
Come on, ZGDX.

291
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,520
Come on!

292
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,730
Let's be covered in thorns

293
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,760
and tread on burning sands!

294
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,510
Cheers!

295
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,670
Cheers!

296
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,970
Let's take a group photo.

297
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,010
Come on.

298
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,580
Leave some space for me.

299
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,930
Come on, ZGDX!

300
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,160
Here.

301
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,080
Cheers!

302
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,510
K.

303
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,150
Let's have a chat.

304
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,470
Who is it?

305
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,530
-Come on. Ignore it.
-I’ll go.

306
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,490
Recently,

307
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,480
a lot of people have been saying

308
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,880
that my relationship with my  K is strained.

309
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,320
Come.

310
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,240
Bottoms up.

311
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,060
Cheers.

312
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,460
Hello, your package.

313
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Please sign here.

314
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,200
Done.

315
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,700
Thank you.

316
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,340
Thank you.

317
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,630
You and I...

318
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,370
What's going on?

319
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,700
Let's go and have a look.

320
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,260
Wait, friends.

321
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:30,950
Here.

322
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,040
This is disgusting.

323
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,150
They actually sent cockroaches?

324
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,080
Are they insane?

325
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,760
Using such underhanded tactics,

326
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,560
how sinister.

327
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,550
Look.

328
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,920
There's a letter in here.

329
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,920
What does it say?

330
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,950
What’s written?

331
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,500
Here’s a little lesson for you.

332
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,460
So arrogant.

333
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,650
Don’t even think about playing in competitions anymore.

334
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,910
The audience seats aren’t that far from the players’ area.

335
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,390
This is clearly targeted at Tong Yao.

336
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,170
Let me take it away.

337
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,370
No. It's disgusting.

338
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,760
I need to take a picture first.

339
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,960
-Yes, this is all evidence.
-Evidence.

340
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,030
And this.

341
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,880
I'll take a photo of this too.

342
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,360
Hello, officer.

343
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,910
I want to make a report.

344
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,150
This person must be insane.

345
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,390
What grudge do they hold

346
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,390
to go this far?

347
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Only a lunatic would do such a thing.

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,060
It's okay. Hold on.

349
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,490
Okay.

350
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,130
There was even a cockroach

351
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,060
in the package.

352
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,910
Usually, the knife and a dead rat are the standard.

353
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,490
They must have switched to a cockroach

354
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,940
because I talked too much on my livestream

355
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,670
and said I was afraid of cockroaches.

356
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,350
Why didn’t I say

357
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,210
I have a fear of diamonds and gold?

358
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,050
You're crying and you're still talking so much.

359
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,260
It hurts.

360
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,220
You nearly poured the entire bottle of alcohol on my hand.

361
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,820
Do you know how much it hurts?

362
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,790
Not as much as my heart.

363
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,500
Is she okay?

364
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,460
Let's go.

365
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,610
She should be fine.

366
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,730
Let's go.

367
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,280
Let's go.

368
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,910
Take a rest.

369
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,910
Cheng.

370
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,800
What's wrong?

371
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,850
There's a threatening letter

372
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,920
in that box.

373
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,780
It says they’ll cause trouble during the match the day after tomorrow.

374
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,500
I’ve already called the police,

375
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,670
and I’ve contacted the event organizers,

376
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,500
asking them to step up security checks.

377
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,300
But it probably won’t help much.

378
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,110
So?

379
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,290
What we’re saying is,

380
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,830
since Tong Yao’s hand is injured,

381
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,960
for safety reasons,

382
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,550
she shouldn’t play against Red Arrow the day after tomorrow.

383
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,170
Lu Yue can practice his skills.

384
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,140
He’s been playing practice matches but not actual matches,

385
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,690
I'm afraid he can't keep up

386
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,660
when we need to rotate him in.

387
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,099
No. There’s no reason to bench her.

388
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,890
Safety first.

389
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,119
Although the injury isn’t too serious,

390
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,319
it’s her hand that’s injured after all.

391
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,940
Their mage and support like to team up with the jungler

392
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,570
and gank the AD as soon as they hit level six.

393
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,810
Your and Cat’s strategy

394
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,640
has been studied pretty thoroughly.

395
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Next time, switch to a new approach.

396
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,470
Alright.

397
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,230
Okay.

398
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,350
Hello everyone.

399
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,510
Because of the recent package incident,

400
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,110
the club has issued a notice.

401
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,270
For safety reasons,

402
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,220
Tong Yao will sit out

403
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,210
Sunday’s match against Red Arrow,

404
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,410
and Lu Yue will start.

405
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,590
Tong Yao, you agreed?

406
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,830
I think it's fine.

407
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,350
It’s a good chance for Lu Yue to practice with a new shikigami.

408
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,550
Maybe he'll need it for future matches.

409
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,750
Moreover, the club is also worried about your safety.

410
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,790
At such a critical moment,

411
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,290
there’s no need to disregard our own safety

412
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,500
just to prove a point.

413
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,670
And I've discussed with Rui.

414
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,550
We decided not to make this matter public for now,

415
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,210
to avoid others imitating it.

416
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,660
Otherwise, I might not be the only unlucky one.

417
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,460
And I don't want my fans to worry.

418
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,540
It’ll inevitably stir up another wave of drama.

419
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,500
Why did Cheng leave?

420
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,090
What's going on?

421
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,590
He's angry.

422
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,140
Are you okay?

423
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,660
This matter is frustrating,

424
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,920
but it can't be helped.

425
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,030
I understand the management’s decision.

426
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,030
Don't blame them.

427
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,990
You're a young girl.

428
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,670
If anything happens to you,

429
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,510
we won't be able to explain it to your family.

430
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,680
Don't worry.

431
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,600
I'm fine.

432
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Where did you go?

433
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,870
Come back.

434
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,050
I'm fine.

435
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,450
I’m just taking a break from one match.

436
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,710
It’s not a suspension.

437
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,160
I won't play.

438
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,860
There's nothing to feel wronged about.

439
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,830
Although being a professional player means

440
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,670
my only job is to play matches,

441
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,550
but fans

442
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,680
are an inevitable part of the package.

443
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,750
Sometimes, you'd think they're too hateful.

444
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,620
Why don't they just disappear?

445
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,870
But sometimes,

446
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,350
if you're in a slump,

447
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,230
it’s often the fans

448
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,770
who support us,

449
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,820
even in places we may not see.

450
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,020
The world isn’t just black and white.

451
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,560
For example,

452
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,100
during the MVP interview the other day,

453
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,360
it was because of the fans’ support

454
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,030
that I had the courage

455
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,680
to say what I did.

456
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,260
I don't regret it, even now.

457
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,180
Forget it.

458
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,310
I don't know what I'm talking about.

459
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,230
Let me ask you something.

460
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,790
Go ahead.

461
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,360
Who was Cheng angry at

462
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,800
when he threw something this afternoon?

463
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,130
Figure it out yourself.

464
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,750
I shouldn’t have asked.

465
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,990
Hello,

466
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,670
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

467
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,270
Sorry.

468
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,710
Why are you so upset?

469
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,300
I don’t want to see tomorrow’s headline saying,

470
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,340
Pro player drives luxury car into the ocean,

471
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
sinking in anger, feeding the fish.

472
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,660
Can you come back?

473
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,700
[Jinyang]

474
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,700
Hello, sister. Are you awake?

475
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,630
How's your hand?

476
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,790
I went home this morning and just came back.

477
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,670
You didn't answer my calls for so long.

478
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,850
I thought you were dead.

479
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,090
I'm fine.

480
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,730
I was just setting up the cat bed

481
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,190
and didn’t see your calls.

482
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,560
Setting up the cat bed?

483
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,320
Why?

484
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,790
So they can sleep with me.

485
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,350
The last time you proactively brought the cats to sleep with you

486
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,070
was the night

487
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,600
you broke up with Jian Yang.

488
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,120
Stop pretending to be strong.

489
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,710
Do you think you’re the heroine of a Korean drama?

490
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,910
I'm really fine.

491
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,030
Don't worry.

492
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,090
Okay, let’s talk when we meet again.

493
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,470
Alright.

494
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,540
Stop fighting.

495
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,630
I'm sleepy.

496
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,450
But my hand hurts.

497
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,520
I want the captain to hold me while I sleep.

498
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,920
What time is it?

499
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,850
It's past three.

500
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,580
Why are you back so late?

501
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,250
You made me worry.

502
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,160
Go to sleep.

503
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,710
Welcome, Onmyoji gurus.

504
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,020
This is the Onmyoji Professional League

505
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,630
National League, and the second match between

506
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,510
ZGDX and Red Arrow.

507
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,590
The current score is 1–0.

508
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,360
Go after him. Great.

509
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,880
ZGDX is using their new mid laner, Lu Yue, for this match.

510
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,600
We still have a chance.

511
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,630
And K is leading the team.

512
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,270
He keeps harassing me.

513
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,290
Chessman is playing aggressively today.

514
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,110
If he’s not ganking someone,

515
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,750
he’s on his way to do so.

516
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,350
He has really little health left!

517
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,710
Yes, Ares is retreating,

518
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,680
but Chessman didn't give him a chance and finished him off.

519
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,410
Nice!

520
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,680
Lu Yue, stop using your second skill to clear the wave.

521
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,950
It costs too much health, and if the enemy jungler comes,

522
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,390
you're done for.

523
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,040
What the hell?

524
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,240
You're pressing me from the beginning.

525
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,870
You're not even letting me farm a single minion wave.

526
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,830
The enemy jungler is missing.

527
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,580
Watch out, Lu Yue.

528
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,540
One Shiro is already giving me a hard time.

529
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,000
You guys better come over quickly after pushing

530
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,090
and scare them.

531
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,470
The captain is pushing the wave,

532
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,840
we can't get through.

533
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,950
K, call for the jungler.

534
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,100
Cat, come, camp mid lane for a bit.

535
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,950
Camp mid lane?

536
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,310
Lu Yue, bait them out,

537
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,100
but don't go too deep.

538
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,620
Okay.

539
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,060
Why are they so excited

540
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,470
once our mid laner changes?

541
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,900
Cat, what do you mean?

542
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,860
On the bot lane, Chessman gets a double kill.

543
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,500
The bot lane fight is absolutely spectacular.

544
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:15,990
Lu Yue,

545
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,000
Pay attention to your position.

546
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,090
Try to bait Shiro.

547
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:18,730
Okay.

548
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,990
Don't rush.

549
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,740
Wait for him to push up a little more.

550
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,950
A little higher.

551
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,990
He pretended to take Shiro's basic attack.

552
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,390
As expected,

553
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,350
Shiro took the bait

554
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,680
and now he can't escape.

555
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,950
I can't leave.

556
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,510
Shiro tries to forcefully kill Lv.

557
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,390
Fall back. Retreat!

558
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,510
Deliberately baiting three members of Red Arrow to pursue them.

559
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,510
Go! Go! Go!

560
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,070
Go!

561
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,510
ZGDX countered with three players,

562
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,710
successfully pulling off a 3-for-0 exchange.

563
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,630
Okay.

564
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,550
This was awesome.

565
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,950
You guys were so smooth.

566
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,750
The game is now at the 30-minute mark.

567
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,540
ZGDX is gaining momentum.

568
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,920
It's all about this team fight now.

569
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,540
Their top laner and ADC are heading to mid to provide support.

570
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,320
Everyone, hide.

571
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,070
I'm coming from the jungle.

572
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,180
Why does everyone have to back Lu Yue up

573
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,670
when he holds down the mid lane?

574
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,470
I'm the core.

575
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,480
You have to protect me.

576
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,640
Pang, you go first.

577
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,510
Okay.

578
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,380
Alright, starting the fight. I'm going in!

579
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,790
Captain, don't go forward.

580
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,950
Chessman's moves

581
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,470
are insane.

582
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,020
He killed one immediately.

583
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,160
Double kill.

584
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,630
Here it comes, triple kill.

585
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,450
Anything else?

586
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,950
Quadra kill—can he get the penta?

587
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,880
Cheng is so unstoppable.

588
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,710
Can he?

589
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,510
Penta kill, penta kill!

590
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,010
The Five Elements Formation completely sealed them off!

591
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,400
Chessman is amazing.

592
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,530
Chessman NB class!

593
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,380
Cheng is amazing.

594
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,540
They're finally pushing high ground.

595
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,880
ZGDX is now grouping up to push the tower.

596
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,010
Chessman is positioning at the front.

597
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,070
Let's congratulate Chessman.

598
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,160
Congratulations to Team ZGDX.

599
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,550
Cheng was so fierce in the game.

600
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,690
[Onmyoji Arena Professional League]

601
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,950
He was so angry.

602
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,110
And for some reason,

603
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,490
I feel like Cheng was so aggressive today.

604
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,840
I think he was playing with some strong emotions.

605
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,380
There were waves where he shouldn’t have engaged, yet he went for it anyway.

606
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,330
He seemed really impulsive.

607
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,650
He seemed angry.

608
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,190
Did something happen?

609
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,570
The starting mid laner was also changed today.

610
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,100
Could it be related to that?

611
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,280
It's possible.

612
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,590
Do you think Cheng

613
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,340
might reveal something later?

614
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,510
He wouldn't confront them outright

615
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,470
even if the host asks silly questions, right?

616
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,350
No way.

617
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,500
He's not coming.

618
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,190
We regret to inform you that

619
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,880
there will be no MVP interview today.

620
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,640
ZGDX's captain, Chessman,

621
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,070
has declined our invitation.

622
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,880
Thank you.

623
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,460
Why? Why did he decline?

624
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,160
Someone explain this.

625
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,390
The bus is here.

626
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:05,850
Hurry up.

627
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,230
Run! Get the scoop!

628
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:07,760
Hurry up.

629
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,550
Rui, let me interview you.

630
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,750
Excuse us, please step aside.

631
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,300
Let us through.

632
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,810
Say something.

633
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,360
Chessman, a quick comment!

634
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,610
Say something.

635
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,710
Today,

636
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,790
you, Chessman,

637
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,740
showed strong emotions during the game

638
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,820
and refused to attend the MVP interview after the competition.

639
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,150
Chessman, please explain.

640
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:23,550
Cheng.

641
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,190
I heard that you won

642
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,190
MVP twice in a row today

643
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,370
but you refused the interview after the game.

644
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,240
This has never happened at a professional league.

645
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,290
Someone said you were emotional while competing today.

646
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,020
Is that true?

647
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,600
What’s the point of asking these kinds of questions?

648
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,310
Everyone knows that

649
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,160
Smiling didn’t participate in today’s match.

650
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,990
Pertaining to this matter,

651
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,600
the club hasn't provided an explanation.

652
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,720
Why is that?

653
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,000
Have you ever seen a team

654
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,460
announce a roster change on Weibo beforehand?

655
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,950
Did the club change the roster

656
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,870
as a disciplinary action

657
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,170
for Smiling's inappropriate remarks last week?

658
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:47,730
No.

659
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,550
Lu Yue played today

660
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,600
purely to prepare for the World Championship.

661
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,680
Smiling,

662
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,520
as a professional player,

663
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,460
has always performed well

664
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,540
in her duties,

665
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,530
aside from that one fight.

666
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,790
Neither I nor the club

667
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,610
have any reason to penalize her.

668
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,980
Yes, please explain.

669
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,050
Can you clarify a bit more?

670
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,310
Have you asked enough?

671
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,230
Who comes to

672
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,800
a club's front door to ask this kind of stuff?

673
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,520
Excuse me.

674
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,030
Everyone.

675
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,010
I don't care if you want to write articles.

676
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,330
But as to what you title

677
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,450
or write in your articles,

678
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,650
be careful.

679
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,930
Especially to certain esports media outlets,

680
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,530
like a certain Esports Farm.

681
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,150
If I catch you

682
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,950
fabricating even one punctuation mark

683
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,610
to sensationalize the story,

684
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,000
we won’t hesitate to sue you

685
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,530
for everything you’ve got.

686
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,750
How could you say that?

687
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,320
They are not usually like this.

688
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,250
What's wrong with them?

689
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,220
What's going on?

690
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,310
Cheng, you're back.

691
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,170
C-c-cheng.

692
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,730
Cheng.

693
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,460
I watched the game.

694
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,490
Why were you playing so aggressively?

695
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,270
Was Pope possessing you or something?

696
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,600
Are you feeling unwell?

697
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,320
Headache?

698
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,400
Stomachache? Or did you catch a cold?

699
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,990
No.

700
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,150
Then why didn’t you accept

701
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,010
the MVP interview after the game?

702
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,480
Or did you read what people were saying online?

703
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,690
What did they say?

704
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,640
They’re saying that

705
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,270
you were upset with the club for benching me,

706
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,510
so you played with anger

707
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,540
and refused the MVP interview

708
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,699
to protest.

709
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,650
Of course,

710
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,290
I know it's not like that.

711
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,920
-How could you…
-I am upset.

712
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,340
But not with the club.

713
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,420
You guys have dinner.

714
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
Don't wait for me.

715
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,280
Sorry, there was a traffic jam.

716
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,870
I brought you something.

717
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,540
What's wrong?

718
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,699
Are you unhappy?

719
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,100
Tell me.

720
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,560
Cheng has been acting strange lately.

721
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,390
As his girlfriend,

722
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,140
you are really observant.

723
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,460
Even the reporters outside

724
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,790
have already started speculating, girl.

725
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,150
Ever since he slammed the door and left that,

726
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,270
until today,

727
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,300
he’s been acting distant and gloomy.

728
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,360
Whatever I say to him,

729
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,230
it feels like

730
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,970
he doesn’t care.

731
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,070
He talks less to me.

732
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,060
Even when he’s holding me,

733
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,690
it’s like his soul is somewhere else.

734
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,590
And when I ask him about it,

735
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,910
he says nothing

736
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,820
and games nonstop.

737
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:30,940
These days,

738
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,580
I've said 'I’m fine'

739
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,560
so many times my lips feel worn out,

740
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,290
but it's useless to him.

741
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,090
I’m starting to wonder

742
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,780
if he's upset with me.

743
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,700
Silent, grumpy, and refuses to cooperate.

744
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,690
That's Lu Sicheng.

745
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,540
I honestly don’t know what to do.

746
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,240
This morning,

747
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,920
he admitted he’s upset,

748
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,150
but he said it’s not with the club.

749
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,260
Could it be me?

750
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,320
Cheng has always been hard to figure out.

751
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,230
This has never happened before.

752
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,050
He used to just focus on playing matches.

753
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,140
You're right.

754
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,740
After you came,

755
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,360
things have been different.

756
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,230
You also think it's because of me?

757
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,560
Stop overthinking.

758
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,980
Your bad habit is acting up again, right?

759
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,300
When you saw Jian Yang

760
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,820
ignoring you in the karaoke room,

761
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,600
you overthought and dumped him over it.

762
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,860
Now you're at it again.

763
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,990
I won’t even mention

764
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,490
how ridiculous you were last time.

765
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,530
At least Jian Yang

766
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,220
had drawn the first stroke on a blank page.

767
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,340
But what about Cheng?

768
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,750
The pen hasn’t even touched paper, and you’re already convicting him.

769
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,270
I'm just saying.

770
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,860
Cheng was

771
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,830
an old man who was focused on gaming.

772
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,210
Now it feels like I dragged him down from the pedestal,

773
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,400
and he’s gotten all wrapped up in this worldly nonsense.

774
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,420
At least on this matter,

775
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,180
those stupid fans are right.

776
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,070
Worldly nonsense? Damn.

777
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,410
I really envy you newlyweds.

778
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
You're still showering each other with compliments

779
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,880
and treating each other like a full-course meal.

780
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,020
I think Cheng

781
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,960
is probably just frustrated with himself.

782
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,050
That’s why he’s in such a bad mood and avoiding you.

783
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,290
Sometimes, men

784
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,040
are much tougher than we think.

785
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,160
But their mysterious ego

786
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,300
can be so fragile.

787
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,330
Maybe

788
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,040
he's hiding somewhere

789
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,360
banging his head against the wall.

790
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,080
Blaming himself

791
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,560
for your little injury.

792
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,350
What small injury?

793
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,670
It's huge, okay?

794
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,700
I had to get a tetanus shot for it,

795
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,150
and I had nightmares the whole night.

796
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,750
Don’t you have any sympathy?

797
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,970
Breaking up is impossible.

798
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,500
I can't fight him either,

799
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,260
so I can only overthink.

800
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,450
Life's so tough.

801
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,730
Seems like you have some self awareness.

802
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,070
It's his fault for ignoring me.

803
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,330
My hand already hurts.

804
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,310
Why isn't he showing any concern?

805
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,220
Doesn’t he know I’m in pain?

806
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,270
Oh,

807
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,740
and another thing.

808
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,570
He disappeared for an entire day

809
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,370
and didn't reply to my messages.

810
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,690
But the next morning,

811
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,490
he sneaked into my bed

812
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,010
and hugged me to sleep.

813
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,480
You were just complaining,

814
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,150
and now you’re bragging?

815
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,830
Who's bragging?

816
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,500
He disappears

817
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,270
and appears whenever he wants.

818
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,470
This kind of behavior

819
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,820
is just despicable.

820
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,350
They must have switched to a cockroach

821
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,910
because I talked too much on my livestream

822
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,210
and said I was afraid of cockroaches.

823
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,790
Why didn't I tell you?

824
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,650
I have a fear of diamonds and gold?

825
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,190
You're crying and you're still talking so much.

826
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,230
It hurts.

827
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,270
You nearly poured the entire bottle of alcohol on my hand.

828
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,070
Do you know how painful it hurts?

829
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,450
Not as much as my heart.

830
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,330
Cheng,

831
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,140
what exactly do you like about Tong Yao?

832
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,340
To be honest,

833
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,940
Tong Yao just looks average.

834
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,840
Tell those gorgeous fans of yours,

835
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,760
who could form a whole battalion.

836
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,370
Because she’s strong.

837
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,180
She's cute when she cries.

838
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,380
Pervert.

839
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,930
Anything else?

840
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,660
Yes.

841
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,330
What?

842
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,780
Love arises unbidden and grows ever deeper.

843
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:32,940
Tong Yao,

844
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,170
you agreed?

845
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,830
I think it's fine.

846
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,930
I am upset.

847
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,010
But not with the club.

848
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,110
You guys have dinner.
