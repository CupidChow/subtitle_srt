Dear fans,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,530
I, your one and only true gossip queen,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,410
am back again.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,220
The National League of OPL

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,230
is about to start.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,980
All the teams are getting ready to announce their starting roster.

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,340
However, Team YQCB's ADC has yet to be decided.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,190
Since ZGDX's substitute mid laner, Lv, returned,

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,690
their starting roster has been up in the air.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,400
So, between Smiling and Lv,

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,150
who do you bet on?

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,270
You're not a starter.

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,230
Why are you taking this so seriously?

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,230
I'm definitely a starter.

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,790
You're definitely not a starter.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,650
You're definitely not a starter.

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,900
Come here if you dare.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,720
Idiot.

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,870
You come here.

20

[Falling into your smile]

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,870
[Episode 9]

22
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,100
Mr. Rui, you're finally here.

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,640
-Hello.
-We've been looking forward to seeing you.

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,680
Cheng is here too?

25
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,910
Come, come, please, this way.

26
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,990
Come on, keep up.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,530
-This way, please.
-Hello.

28
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,490
The foundation is too thick.

29
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,370
Is it?

30
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,450
Let me see.

31
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,900
You're right.

32
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,820
Then I won't apply concealer for you.

33
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,170
I'll just apply setting powder directly,

34
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,930
alright?

35
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,210
Oh my god,

36
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:24,090
Cheng, your skin is so good.

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,650
I know.

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,300
Do you have any skincare secrets?

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,060
Youth.

40
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,690
I'm already very handsome.

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,610
No need to put on more makeup.

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,560
No.

43
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,810
You'll look even better with makeup.

44
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,960
Come on, darling.

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,410
Why are you shaping my eyebrows?

46
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,250
My eyebrows are handsome, okay?

47
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,970
They are.

48
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,740
But did you notice that the two sides are uneven?

49
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,810
Really?

50
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,570
Yes.

51
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,230
Use lipstick #502 as a base,

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,640
then apply lipstick #303.

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,170
It'll look natural and give me a healthy glow.

54
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,520
Can I skip the eyeliner?

55
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,810
It looks weird.

56
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,810
Are you sure?

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,690
Rui,

58
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,530
come and take a look.

59
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,770
After I applied eyeliner on Cat,

60
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,430
doesn't he look more refined?

61
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,430
It's a must.

62
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,460
Come on, relax.

63
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,180
I can't apply it if you keep being like this.

64
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,810
Sir, add more side contour, please.

65
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,610
My face is big.

66
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,970
Your face is not big, dear.

67
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,900
Really?

68
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,650
This is the first time I've heard someone say that.

69
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,910
It's just a bit chubby.

70
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,510
K, do you think my eyeliner looks exquisite?

71
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,630
Tong Yao, you're not done yet?

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,090
Women are so troublesome.

73
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,570
It's fine.

74
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,490
We're taking the promo shots first anyway.

75
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,930
Let's go. Let's take them first.

76
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,460
By the time they finish, you should be almost done.

77
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,330
It's okay, take your time.

78
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,450
Wait, Rui.

79
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,650
Where are the team uniforms?

80
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,530
On the sofa.

81
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,590
Then where is the changing room?

82
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,120
Just find a place here to change.

83
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,520
No one will watch anyway.

84
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,600
Are you going to change?

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,730
If you are, I'll give you some privacy.

86
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,240
No rush, no rush.

87
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,670
Let's continue with the makeup for a bit longer.

88
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,339
Okay.

89
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,140
No wonder our ZGDX is the esports star team.

90
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,730
Look at Cheng's legs.

91
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,170
Pang,

92
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,810
why don't you take the photo alone?

93
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,070
Without a comparison,

94
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,730
you're definitely the handsome one among the fatties.

95
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,650
Thanks.

96
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,500
You said the same thing last year.

97
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,290
What time is it now?

98
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,650
It should be time for the group photo, right?

99
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,050
Yeah, it's getting late.

100
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,850
Why hasn't our girl arrived yet?

101
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,800
We've finished shooting the white ones.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,810
She didn't turn herself into an empress, did she?

103
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,090
Women are so slow.

104
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,780
When they say they're going out,

105
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,780
it means they're going to wash their hair, comb it, blow-dry it,

106
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,900
match their clothes, spray perfume,

107
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,250
choose their bags and shoes.

108
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,730
Exactly.

109
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,490
That's right.

110
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,909
Let me make an arrangement then.

111
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,650
Cheng,

112
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,170
why don't you go and call her over?

113
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,070
Me?

114
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,110
You're really good at arranging things, aren't you?

115
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,100
She's afraid of you.

116
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,880
As soon as you show up,

117
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,540
she'll come running like her life depends on it.

118
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,950
Come on, Pang,

119
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,880
let's continue.

120
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,770
Tony,

121
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,730
do you think I should add a bit more eyeshadow?

122
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,090
No, it's perfect, really.

123
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,920
I feel like my eyelashes are about to fall off.

124
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,550
It's already perfect, really.

125
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,870
Don't worry.

126
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,210
They won't fall off.

127
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,160
They'll rush you if you keep stalling.

128
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,530
Alright, I'll go change into the team uniform.

129
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,770
Go ahead and change.

130
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,620
Thank you.

131
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,250
Looks like Jinyang really is experienced in this area.

132
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,700
Shorty, the sun's almost set...

133
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,430
Hurry up.

134
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,960
Cheng, what are you doing?

135
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,360
The studio's rushing us.

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,920
Cheng, what's wrong?

137
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,940
Where's that damn Shorty?

138
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,820
Go back first.

139
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,090
What's wrong?

140
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,730
She's inside?

141
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,250
Yes.

142
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,000
What's she doing?

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,310
I don't know. You go back first.

144
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,510
She'll be there soon.

145
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,250
Rui insists that I take a photo with her,

146
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,530
that's why I came over.

147
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,880
Alright, hurry up then.

148
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,840
Who were you talking to?

149
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,660
Lu Yue.

150
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,840
If you're done getting dressed, come out.

151
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,900
Don't waste time.

152
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,450
So you saw everything just now?

153
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,430
I'm not blind.

154
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,930
The pattern is very small.

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,920
But I saw it.

156
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,750
I've told you to knock before entering the room.

157
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,150
Lu Yue also wanted to come in directly just now.

158
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,150
I stopped him.

159
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm talking about you.

160
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,470
Why did you bring up Lu Yue?

161
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,380
You've been inside for an hour and forty minutes.

162
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,650
When I opened the door, the chances of

163
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,850
seeing you like this

164
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,490
in these clothes

165
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,230
were about the same as finding you

166
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,630
lying on the floor, dead.

167
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,470
But...

168
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,410
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,210
Next time, I'll knock first.

170
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,210
Lu Sicheng actually apologized to me?

171
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,820
What's wrong with you?

172
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,060
Why did you suddenly apologize to me so seriously?

173
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,840
I thought you needed a serious apology.

174
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,880
I do.

175
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,010
If it were ancient times, you'd have to marry me.

176
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,090
Don't go too far.

177
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,500
Don't push it.

178
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,220
I was wrong.

179
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,680
You're finally here.

180
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,340
Sis,

181
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,930
what's wrong with your face?

182
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,930
What do you mean?

183
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,820
Have you ever seen a monkey's butt?

184
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,130
What did you two do in the room?

185
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:27,800
We ran here.

186
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,980
Aren't we in a hurry?

187
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,170
Then why aren't you out of breath?

188
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,970
I have long legs.

189
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,340
Alright, alright, stop chatting.

190
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,910
Let's get back to the point.

191
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,450
Tong Yao, let's take the photos now.

192
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,170
Okay.

193
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,250
Come on, time for photos.

194
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,790
Let's go.

195
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,140
Well… cross your arms,

196
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,570
tilt your chin slightly upward,

197
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
look straight ahead,

198
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,040
and lower your gaze.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,550
Good.

200
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,320
Won't that make my face look too big?

201
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,670
It will.

202
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,870
And lowering my gaze?

203
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,640
Won't that make my eyes disappear?

204
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,970
But it looks more fierce this way.

205
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,500
Just imagine you're a queen.

206
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,610
A queen?

207
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,600
-Yes.
-If you want Thumbelina to play a queen,

208
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,570
you should at least consider

209
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,830
whether her image can be molded that way.

210
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,290
Lu Yue,

211
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,380
go up there and take a set of duo photos with Tong Yao.

212
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,730
I want that sense of a fateful showdown,

213
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,010
the feeling of a battle between two destined enemies,

214
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,190
and a silent war

215
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,370
between the main player and the substitute,

216
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,900
with an intense clash full of killing intent.

217
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,530
We need to create a sense of conflict between you two,

218
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,990
because of your competitive relationship.

219
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,790
Step aside, step aside.

220
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,520
Over here.

221
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,700
Show me that clueless vibe you have when you're fighting for chairs.

222
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,360
Rui actually wants you to just play yourselves.

223
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,220
Cheng, get up there.

224
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,090
For what?

225
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,270
For taking photos, of course.

226
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,190
Why do I need to take photos alone with her?

227
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,920
The ZGDX's prince and princess

228
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,590
need to take some pictures together, of course.

229
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,580
It's required by the club's PR department.

230
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,880
Even if you don't take the photos, they'll be photoshopped anyway.

231
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,140
Might as well make them look good, right?

232
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,340
Bring a chair over here.

233
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,020
Miss, come down first.

234
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,060
I didn't tell you to stand up there.

235
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,980
Cheng, sit down.

236
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,270
Why does this feel like they're taking wedding photos?

237
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,690
It does.

238
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,790
Look over here.

239
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,220
We can fight.

240
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,820
Go to the high ground.

241
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,810
Wait for me. Wait for me to lock it down.

242
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,130
Don't rush, don't rush.

243
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,900
We can fight!

244
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,200
-Go!
-Okay, okay, okay.

245
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,330
Cat, come over here.

246
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,890
Come on.

247
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,490
Come on. Come on.

248
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,450
Yes!

249
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,680
This round was easy.

250
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,610
Sis,

251
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,810
you're such a noob.

252
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,210
You were here staring at me like a vulture.

253
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,450
How was I supposed to perform well?

254
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,980
And besides, didn't we win?

255
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,710
Since we won, I'm thinking of ordering some afternoon tea.

256
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,770
-What do you want to eat?-
-Good idea.

257
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,970
I want that...

258
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,330
-What's it called?
-No need to order for me.

259
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,470
Jinyang is coming to see me later.

260
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,630
I'll eat with her.

261
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,280
-I'll order a salad for you.
-This one.

262
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,690
I'll order this one for you.

263
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,890
I've had this before.

264
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,730
What's wrong?

265
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,920
Our official account just posted a preview of our promo shots from yesterday.

266
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,380
This photo is really good.

267
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,180
Look at this one.

268
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,790
-Not bad.
-Lu Yue is handsome.

269
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,230
Look at the next few ones.

270
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,400
My Lv, you finally showed up.

271
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,520
This photo looks good.

272
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,090
A new generation of light and shadow has been born.

273
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,390
I'm getting more and more excited about the National League.

274
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,170
The Yue-Yao shippers are suddenly rising.

275
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,650
Our little Yue is truly a pretty boy.

276
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,020
Aren't Smiling and Cheng a couple?

277
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,120
This photo is stirring up trouble.

278
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,610
Cheng-Yao shippers, hold your ground

279
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,730
and don't waver!

280
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,230
I was the one who told the official account to post the photos.

281
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,450
Before the official announcement,

282
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,520
I want those who can understand to get it.

283
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,810
Not many people got it.

284
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,050
Most people think your team has one girl marrying two guys

285
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,850
and already went to the civil affairs office to register.

286
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,650
Most people?

287
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,280
Who?

288
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,910
My mom, his mom.

289
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,850
I have five missed calls

290
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,250
and over ten unanswered texts,

291
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,290
all asking

292
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,550
if her sons have girlfriends,

293
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,820
why our couple photos were posted on the official account,

294
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,910
and why it's the same woman.

295
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,790
Hello, Mom.

296
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,120
No, not at all.

297
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,130
Tong Yao and I are not what you think.

298
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,980
My brother?

299
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,250
As for my brother,

300
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,690
I don't know...

301
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,260
It's a good thing my parents don't have Weibo.

302
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,440
Rio is nice to drink.

303
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,970
It tastes even better with a picture of a girl.

304
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,650
The photos look good.

305
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,700
What are you talking about?

306
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,450
Our team prohibits internal relationships.

307
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,370
Prohibits internal relationships?

308
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,630
Then, about you and Cheng being in the same room,

309
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,260
did you forget it, or was I blind?

310
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,420
What?

311
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,630
That was because he saw me fall off the bed

312
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,050
and came over to laugh at me.

313
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,540
Keep pretending.

314
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,860
I'm here to play professionally.

315
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,110
No one said you came with ill intentions.

316
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,840
That's what the comments are saying.

317
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
Ignore them.

318
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,250
I heard Cheng and Lu Yue are brothers.

319
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,970
You know what?

320
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,100
They do look alike.

321
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,900
But Cheng is a bit taller.

322
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,050
They're equally handsome, though.

323
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,450
For a moment, it made me think that

324
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,250
there are handsome guys everywhere in the esports industry.

325
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,090
And then?

326
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,580
And then,

327
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,140
how did I end up with someone like Ai Jia,

328
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,920
a frog in a world full of handsome guys?

329
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,250
Ai Jia is handsome too.

330
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,230
But he's not as handsome as Cheng.

331
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,570
Cheng is the esports heartthrob.

332
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,410
Ai Jia is nothing more than a tag-along,

333
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,810
always clinging to me.

334
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,380
I can swing my arm all I want, but I just can't shake him off.

335
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,710
I can tell you're secretly enjoying this.

336
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,060
But anyway,

337
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,530
on the day of the promo shoot,

338
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,160
did you really wear that rabbit and carrot outfit?

339
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,850
Yeah.

340
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,350
What's wrong with it?

341
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,170
I feel like I might have misunderstood something.

342
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,330
What is it?

343
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,340
But I'm not sure.

344
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,010
Some people like that style.

345
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,040
But you must be careful.

346
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,530
Anyone who likes that style

347
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,220
is definitely a pervert.

348
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,770
What are you talking about?

349
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,160
The whole debate online about who the starting player is

350
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,770
between you and Lu Yue has been blowing up.

351
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,370
Someone even started a poll.

352
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,320
Not bad, sister.

353
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,040
I didn't expect you to have so many fans.

354
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,619
I'm talented and cute,

355
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,930
so of course I have fans.

356
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,530
Unlike Lu Yue, who's just relying on his looks.

357
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,440
Your fans are really professional.

358
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,329
They even made a video

359
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,609
analyzing your strengths and weaknesses.

360
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,450
It's like the slides they use

361
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,530
in university project presentations.

362
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,770
They truly love you.

363
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,020
With that kind of effort,

364
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,750
they could even win over Xu Kai.

365
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,210
Let me see.

366
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,420
Let me see what weaknesses Lu Yue has.

367
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,470
[He plays too conservatively, lacks passion, while Tong Yao has a whole bunch of weaknesses:]

368
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,470
[She needs to improve at playing Tamamo-no-Mae, doesn't like showing her face on streams, and has too many rumors with Lu Sichen]

369
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,410
What's wrong with these people?

370
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,960
Can rumors really be linked to gaming skills?

371
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,250
This obviously was made by some elementary school kids.

372
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,110
You're attracting hate, sister.

373
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,780
You're living under the same roof

374
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,930
with the dream of countless girls,

375
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,040
spending 24 hours a day together.

376
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,550
I'm so jealous I could cry.

377
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,030
You have a boyfriend.

378
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,500
Watch your words.

379
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,580
Are you done chatting?

380
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,970
God Ming is asking you to come down for training.

381
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,010
If you keep delaying, he'll come up and get you.

382
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,570
No, no, I'll come down right now.

383
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,570
Don't act rashly.

384
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,690
This "Rabbit Hugging a Carrot"

385
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,350
told you not to act rashly.

386
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,600
Hugging a carrot?

387
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,720
Cheng, you need to explain.

388
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,170
What?

389
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,010
Who's the one with the WeChat name

390
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,540
"Rabbit Hugging A Carrot"?

391
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,330
Sis, are you alright?

392
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,330
Why did you run? That was dangerous.

393
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,180
Sis, are you alright?

394
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,170
Why did you run?

395
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,410
That was dangerous.

396
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,770
What if you hurt your face?

397
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,300
How much would it cost to get plastic surgery?

398
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,250
Yao, are you alright?

399
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,070
Come on.

400
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,780
Did you get hurt?

401
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,250
Does it hurt?

402
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,910
Let's go.

403
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,560
Why were you snooping through my phone

404
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,420
while using it?

405
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,670
So nosy.

406
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,140
Are you alright?

407
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:03,770
I'm fine.

408
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,550
Then I'll be going.

409
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,270
Good luck with your training.

410
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,700
Aren't you going to check on your ex next door?

411
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,970
Being proud feels good for a moment, but when it comes to making up, it feels like being in hell.

412
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,210
Just let him burn in hell.

413
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:15,900
Bye.

414
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,920
Come out with me.

415
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,100
Give it to me.

416
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
Take it yourself.

417
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,280
It's good.

418
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,660
I meant your phone.

419
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,690
Delete the note.

420
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,450
What?

421
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,550
Delete the note.

422
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,330
What note?

423
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,810
Delete the note.

424
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,180
I don't understand what you're talking about.

425
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,300
Delete the note.

426
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,720
Oh, that note.

427
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:03,810
as I recall,

428
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,930
I remember when I asked someone to delete the Weibo post,

429
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,010
she told me,

430
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,100
"No."

431
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,330
That was so long ago.

432
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,840
How can you still hold a grudge about it?

433
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,520
Besides,

434
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,360
you locked me out first.

435
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,090
Aren't you still holding a grudge too?

436
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,770
Your note is really weird.

437
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,990
What if one day someone sees my un...

438
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,270
um, that thing,

439
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,820
and then sees your note?

440
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,510
What do you think they'll think?

441
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,070
Who are you planning to show that to anyway?

442
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,890
I'm not planning to show it to anyone.

443
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,770
But what you're doing is disturbing.

444
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,970
Why is it disturbing?

445
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,340
Don't you think

446
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,850
that giving your teammate a WeChat note

447
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,580
with an image of her underwear

448
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,900
makes you seem

449
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,590
like a pervert?

450
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:42,900
A pervert?

451
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,820
If I were a pervert, I wouldn't act perverted around you.

452
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,420
Do you think I have no taste, or that I'm stupid?

453
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,340
Good for you.

454
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,360
Don't come over! Don't come over!

455
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,050
Help!

456
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,950
Hey, go away!

457
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,210
What kind of rabbit are you?

458
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:07,930
Go away!

459
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,120
How can there be such a perverted rabbit like you?

460
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,310
If I were a pervert, I wouldn't act perverted around you.

461
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,430
Do you think I have no taste?

462
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,270
Are you crazy or am I stupid?

463
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,050
Go away!

464
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,790
Pancake,

465
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,770
if you sit on my face again while I'm sleeping,

466
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,370
you'll be sleeping outside.

467
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,950
If I were a pervert, I wouldn't act perverted around you.

468
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,310
Do you think I have no taste?

469
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,900
Are you crazy or am I stupid?

470
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,370
Am I crazy?

471
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,850
Not only did I dream about you in my sleep,

472
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,310
but even when I see you, I think of Lu Sicheng.

473
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,310
The National League is starting this week.

474
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,770
We'll draw lots to determine our opponents.

475
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,690
To help you guys get into the right mindset quickly,

476
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,450
we've arranged

477
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,250
a practice match with Team YQCB.

478
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,380
The relegation team next door?

479
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,850
Why are we playing against them?

480
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,170
Their new ADC has arrived.

481
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,530
I heard it's big news.

482
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,070
So, we need to be prepared.

483
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,730
Tong Yao, you'll play

484
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,010
in the practice match later.

485
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,050
Thank you, Rui.

486
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,940
You thanked the wrong person.

487
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,810
This was decided by Cheng and God Ming.

488
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,690
Why?

489
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:32,980
You just came back

490
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,410
and haven't had much time to adjust with the team.

491
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,740
Let's have Tong Yao play in today's match.

492
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,630
So, does that mean I'll be the starter?

493
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,740
Not necessarily.

494
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,130
Before the National League starts,

495
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,140
we'll compare your data with Lu Yue's.

496
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,570
Whoever performs better will be the starting mid laner.

497
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,450
If someone loses again this afternoon,

498
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,210
the cold chair by the water cooler

499
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,010
will be yours.

500
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,510
[We're ready]

501
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,500
They're ready. Let's go into the room.

502
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,440
Good luck, everyone.

503
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,340
-I'll go get some food.
-Be quick.

504
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,250
I'll leave it to you.

505
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,310
Alright, alright.

506
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:06,830
Let's go.

507
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,810
Why is the enemy ADC's ID also garbled text?

508
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,090
What's wrong?

509
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,700
I didn't expect there to be someone

510
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,560
as perverted as you in this world.

511
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,970
Watch your words.

512
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,210
Everyone, focus later.

513
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,410
Follow my lead.

514
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,730
Okay, okay. Coming.

515
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,780
Focus on farming.

516
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,460
Don't fight

517
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,120
and wait for K to gank.

518
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,510
Cheng, their ADC is pretty aggressive.

519
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,650
Go back and heal up first.

520
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,100
Okay.

521
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,060
Cheng, what's going on?

522
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,040
The enemy Youko dove the tower for a kill.

523
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,310
That's really aggressive.

524
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,630
Shut up. Keep going.

525
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,200
Lu Sicheng respawned.

526
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,330
We're pulling back.

527
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,900
Pang, follow me.

528
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,930
Beware of denied vision.

529
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,700
Got it.

530
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,520
They're coming, go!

531
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,080
Damn! Why are they here?

532
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,280
Why are they here?

533
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,050
Sis,

534
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,050
why didn't you tell us when their mid laner disappeared?

535
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,660
I just saw him recall.

536
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,870
Who knew he was faking it?

537
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,550
Cheng,

538
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,820
how did they know you were stealing the small camps?

539
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,950
Did you get spotted?

540
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,860
Impossible.

541
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,890
I was practically sticking to you.

542
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,650
Why do I feel like

543
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,780
the enemies suddenly really understand your playstyle?

544
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,820
Cheng, hold on.

545
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,810
I'm getting nervous with you guys playing like this.

546
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,140
How about I go instead?

547
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,270
Go away. Go back to the water cooler.

548
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,410
Pang, ult.

549
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,160
Got it.

550
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,330
Yes!

551
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,970
Awesome!

552
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,190
Cheng is still as impressive as always.

553
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,880
Cheng, what are you doing?

554
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,460
Hit them!

555
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,450
Cheng, hit them!

556
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,100
Hit them, hit them!

557
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,480
Move!

558
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,970
Youko is mine.

559
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,730
Cheng, where are you going?

560
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,420
Cheng, what are you doing?

561
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,130
Come and hit them!

562
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,210
Where's our ADC?

563
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,010
Is he lost?

564
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,920
Report our ADC

565
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,040
for not joining the teamfight.

566
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,420
Deduct his points and give him a bad review.

567
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,370
I've got them controlled. Go! Chase!

568
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,050
One down. Nice!

569
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,210
Go, go, go! Charge!

570
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,460
Charge! Charge!

571
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,380
-I'll use my ult!
-Hurry up.

572
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,210
We won!

573
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,530
Yes!

574
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,590
We won again?

575
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,070
We finally won.

576
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,650
This round was exhausting.

577
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,170
Who's the enemy Youko player?

578
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,830
They played so aggressively.

579
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,200
Pope is here.

580
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,740
Pope?

581
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,710
What are you talking about?

582
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,010
Cheng, stop fooling me.

583
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,560
No one but Pope

584
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,190
can take two of my lives in a row

585
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,540
and understand

586
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,410
Youko and Dodomeki so well.

587
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,400
So, Pope joined Team YQCB?

588
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,480
What do you mean?

589
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,660
Say that again.

590
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,450
It should be officially announced soon.

591
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,020
Why is Cheng so sure about something

592
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,890
that hasn't officially been announced?

593
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,220
He knows Pope that well?

594
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,050
Didn't Rui mention it last time?

595
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,210
Cheng and Pope

596
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,850
are like light and shadow.

597
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,050
I know about that.

598
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,180
But their relationship is that good?

599
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,260
I smell gossip.

600
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,330
What happened?

601
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,070
There's a story?

602
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,110
Our Cheng used to be a substitute

603
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,180
on a top-tier Korean team.

604
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,010
Back then, he was Pope's substitute.

605
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,840
The two of them, whether in playstyle

606
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,570
or shikigami pool,

607
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,210
were cut from the same mold.

608
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,300
Back then, both in China and abroad,

609
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,830
people said Cheng was Pope's shadow.

610
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,890
Some even said he was imitating Pope.

611
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,580
You know Cheng.

612
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,550
He's very proud.

613
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,750
He probably hasn't liked that comparison for a long time.

614
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,250
It was officially announced.

615
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,530
Pope has joined YQCB.

616
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,910
There are a lot of fan comments about it.

617
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,200
It's happening!

618
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,120
He crossed a thousand miles to find his wife.

619
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,210
Our Junhe

620
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,410
has come to OPL!

621
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,620
Am I dreaming?

622
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,240
If this isn't love...

623
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,270
It's love! Cheng, have you seen it?

624
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,800
Your Junhe is here!

625
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,480
But I'm very curious,

626
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,940
why did Pope come to China?

627
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,190
Isn't it obvious?

628
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,920
It's because of Cheng.

629
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,120
Chessman and Hierophant—

630
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,800
the Pope and the pawn.

631
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,260
They're like light and shadow.

632
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,590
But like Rui said before,

633
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,850
though we don't need to shiver with fear,

634
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,800
Cheng used to shine brightly in Korea

635
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,510
when he played professionally

636
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,730
and even had Pope sitting on the bench

637
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,989
for two whole seasons.

638
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,070
Really?

639
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:21,830
That amazing?

640
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,739
Pretty impressive, right?

641
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,699
Haven't you noticed how well Cheng speaks Korean?

642
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,420
He was also the shot-caller there.

643
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,320
He left only because he wanted to come back and play professionally in China.

644
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,969
So why did he want to come back and play professionally in China?

645
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,320
Because of his love for the country.

646
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,900
Cheng wants to lead a Chinese professional team

647
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,690
to win the World Championship.

648
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,139
That's why he came back.

649
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,940
You're making me feel a bit moved.

650
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,820
So, you see,

651
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,400
those who say Cheng returned to China

652
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,330
because the Pope rose again

653
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,060
and he was benched,

654
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,389
feeling down on the substitute bench,

655
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,290
are just talking nonsense.

656
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,080
In other words,

657
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,550
Cheng wasn't forced to come back at all.

658
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,280
He chose to come back on his own.

659
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,460
And then? What happened?

660
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,949
And of course, Pope wasn't happy about it.

661
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:54,730
How could the shadow outshine the light?

662
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,120
We haven't officially faced each other yet,

663
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,260
and I haven't officially beaten you.

664
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,450
How could you just leave?

665
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,690
Is everything I have now just what you didn't want

666
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,290
and handed down to me?

667
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,570
That's what happened.

668
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,080
Then our team,

669
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,450
last year, because of a lot of things…

670
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,050
Anyway, since we didn't make it to the finals,

671
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,780
they never had a chance to face each other directly.

672
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,780
So this season, Pope just came over.

673
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,630
Really?

674
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,740
Of course.

675
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,390
And the most interesting part is,

676
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,230
these two are incredibly in sync.

677
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,910
Today,

678
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,170
just from one game,

679
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,800
Cheng figured out it was Pope on the other side.

680
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,400
And I even saw fanart of the two of them

681
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,960
on Esports Farm.

682
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,670
I was going to print it out and give it to Cheng.

683
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,150
I wonder what his poker face would be like

684
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,070
when he sees it.

685
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,780
He'll probably be furious.

686
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,140
You really must be asking for trouble.

687
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,560
K,

688
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,840
what is fanart?

689
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,360
Have you seen "The 18 Bronzemen of Shaolin Temple"?

690
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,210
Yes, I have.

691
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,330
They used to be monks?

692
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,860
That's impressive.

693
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,210
Amazing.

694
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,570
But who do you think is stronger, Cheng or Pope?

695
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,930
Cheng, of course.

696
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,410
Homegrown is better.

697
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,100
Fanboy.

698
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,930
Welcome to TAT, Lu Sicheng.

699
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,550
This is Pope.

700
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,750
His in-game account is Hierophant.
