1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We often say that when you remember a game,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you are actually remembering a youth.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I didn't tell everyone before that it's because we broke up for a year.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's been a long time since I've been here.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Of course, these are just memories.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After all, who's still keeping the soul-fighting?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The End

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Fnatic, I think you don't need to introduce yourself.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The old man and the opponent officially entered the Chinese market and fought with us.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We lost two games in four wins and lost two games.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Brother Cheng, do you need me to repeat it?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No need.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This year, I need you to take the responsibility seriously.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because they have a team from the World Final last year.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:24,680
That is, the old man from Brother Cheng, the TAT team, bought the Korean

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and won the game.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't know how to handle my weakness.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The main goal of the team is to win the game on the mid-to-mid.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So the team from the mid-to-mid needs to cooperate.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay?

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sister, it's almost a match.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Should I use these?

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Tong Yao, except for the early game, who else do you have?

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Except for the early game.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Except for the early game, do you know anything else?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The other team has bought the Chinese market.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Who said that?

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have a lot of skills.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm so angry and I'm so greedy.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can do anything.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
When the training is over, the opponent will pay you the early game.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So you need to be prepared.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You need to fight against the opponent first.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You need to get the body, the knife, and the night tea.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll give you the hand to the other two teams.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You need to take the 10,000-year-old bamboo first.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If the white wolf is not near,

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
the opponent should choose to go down to the white wolf and the one-eyed bamboo.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Brother Cheng can continue to get the demon fruit.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Xiao Pang can choose the black copper seed or the seaå¹«.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The choice of the game is not much.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
According to the data of Kun,

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
it may choose to protect the girl.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The top team should choose the two sides of the Buddha or the nine-tun.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To avoid the damage of the game,

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the possibility of the nine-tun is greater.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Tong Yao, which team are you going to choose?

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The Big Sky Dog.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay. The Big Sky Dog.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The Big Sky Dog.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're amazing, God of the Gods.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're not limited.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Tong Yao, this is the first training game for you to come to ZGDX.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can't lose your confidence.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, okay.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I won't lose my confidence to the team.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're confident.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We must win this game.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Come on, everyone.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Come on, Tao Yao.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll prepare some food for everyone.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The meal is ready.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll leave the rest to you.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The first round is over.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The first round of the match is over.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Watch out for the cat.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Be careful not to get into the game.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The game is coming to us.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll go against them.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't go.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Go directly to the top.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They're not here.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The cat is close to the wild area.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Just in case.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Brother Cheng, how do you know they're not here?

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The Buddha is very strong.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Moreover, the position he just walked is clearly seen by the cat.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He also chooses to continue walking.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If he doesn't guess it wrong,

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
he should be in the lower group.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,960
Brother, hopefully he won't pass by the ft later.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,020
Songphony Yang.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The other shit is really weird.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When you ask them to leave them for after the event,

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,940
they'll regret that they're leaving.

99
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,000
Butterfly flows.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Wei A Jia is now Huawei also set to centrally train.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If we don't steal mage Zhang person,

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
we'll have to cut off the lead to win the game.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,720
Don't hide in the place where you haven't lost your job.

104
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,800
What if you get hit by the enemy?

105
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,480
I've confirmed that the God of Eyes

106
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,200
is also a person who is not smart.

107
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,240
Sister, you're fierce.

108
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
You're too scared.

109
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't be scared.

110
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,920
Xia Gui is still in the game.

111
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,400
Do you have time to play?

112
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
Do you want to play another Weibo?

113
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,240
Xia Lu and I are here.

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,920
Be careful.

115
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Don't mind him.

116
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Go to the top of the building.

117
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,360
Go to the top of the building with Lao Mao.

118
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,960
Okay.

119
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,200
Xia Pang, let's go back to the base.

120
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,360
Let Kun think that there's no one at the bottom of the building.

121
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,720
The enemy's support is coming home.

122
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,960
Get ready.

123
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,560
I'm here.

124
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,640
Go to the grass nearby and squat.

125
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,480
Wait for Lao Mao to wake up.

126
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
Then come to the dream to catch the enemy.

127
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
The enemy is gone.

128
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,560
Be careful.

129
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,840
Come to my house at the bottom of the road.

130
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,640
Okay.

131
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,720
They're gone.

132
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
Lao Mao, K, kill the top.

133
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,960
Follow Lao K.

134
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,280
Coming.

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,480
Lao Mao, wake up.

136
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,400
Coming.

137
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,560
Lao Mao, wake up.

138
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,720
No, it's a house.

139
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,240
Hurry up.

140
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,560
Go.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,560
Go.

142
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,180
I am injured.

143
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,080
Nice.

144
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Stop it.

145
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,360
Brother Teng, why didn't you go to be the director?

146
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,360
I went to the real direction.

147
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,640
First tide

148
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,040
First tide

149
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,840
First tide

150
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,800
Sport 2

151
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:08,040
Kick

152
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,760
maker

153
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
I'm dead.

154
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm going to get you.

155
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Well, the fire god is sealed.

156
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Be careful, Old K.

157
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Get out of here.

158
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
I'm out.

159
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
I'll come back.

160
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Don't go. I can do it.

161
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
The fairy is starting again.

162
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
What's going on?

163
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
What's going on?

164
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
What's going on?

165
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
What's going on?

166
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
What's going on?

167
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Old K, be careful.

168
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
I'm coming.

169
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Old K, be careful.

170
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Old K, be careful.

171
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Old K, be careful.

172
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Old K, be careful.

173
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Old K, be careful.

174
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Nice.

175
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Nice.

176
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
Nice.

177
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Ying Le, what's wrong?

178
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Amazing.

179
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
It's amazing.

180
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Miss, you're good at playing the dog.

181
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
I'm really out of the woods.

182
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I should play the game.

183
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
But I'm not bad.

184
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
It's not that big.

185
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Miss,

186
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
don't say that.

187
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
You're really good at playing the god.

188
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
You're impulsive.

189
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
I think I can play.

190
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
They taught you

191
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
almost all skills

192
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
to kill you.

193
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
It's the time to relax.

194
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
I can't play this game.

195
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
I can't stay for too long.

196
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
You're too polite.

197
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
You taught me well.

198
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Be quiet.

199
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
It's a good thing to be confident.

200
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
You should teach others to be smart.

201
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
I think the team is good.

202
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
Right?

203
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Yes.

204
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Just look at it.

205
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Just look at it.

206
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
I ordered milk tea for everyone.

207
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Thank you.

208
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Milk tea?

209
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Thank you.

210
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Sit down.

211
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Sit down.

212
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Let's go.

213
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Let's go.

214
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Brother Cheng,

215
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
aren't you going?

216
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
No.

217
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Our finality is very strong.

218
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
It's just a game.

219
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
We'll win soon.

220
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
But...

221
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Sister GGDX,

222
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
the middle class is Oligay.

223
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
That operation

224
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
showed me a good physical strength.

225
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm looking forward to

226
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
meeting her

227
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,760
on the match.

228
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,760
I'll...

229
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Stop looking.

230
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Stop looking.

231
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
You're really making a fuss.

232
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
No one has complimented me

233
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
since I graduated from primary school.

234
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Let me listen to two more sentences.

235
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
It must be good.

236
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Stop listening to her.

237
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
I want to hear compliments.

238
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
I compliment you.

239
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
The beautiful girl

240
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
is very dangerous.

241
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Okay.

242
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,760
My mom

243
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
said it to me.

244
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Although

245
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
this team is very good,

246
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
I...

247
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
But next time,

248
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
I won't be fooled.

249
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Okay.

250
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
What do you mean?

251
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Captain,

252
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
I'm going to be a good player today.

253
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
What do you think?

254
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
I'm not bad.

255
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Then, Captain,

256
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
do you have any rewards?

257
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
I've never been

258
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
a good player since I graduated from primary school.

259
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
From Captain to you,

260
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
I'll reward you with a little flower.

261
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Keep working hard.

262
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
I'll try to spend the night with you next time.

263
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Lu Si Cheng,

264
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
you're not graduated yet?

265
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
You silly Lu Si Cheng.

266
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
You can't wipe your hands.

267
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
You have to reward yourself.

268
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
You have to wipe your hands

269
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
after you get the reward.

270
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Why are you so hard to get?

271
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
And,

272
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
you can't talk dirty.

273
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Don't talk dirty.

274
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
I'll get you a new one.

275
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
I'll pay for it.

276
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
I'll pay for your head.

277
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Let me tell you.

278
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Today's training match

279
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
is really the best.

280
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Miss's operation is

281
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
66665.

282
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
It's really a smart flower.

283
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Fatty called it Smiling.

284
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
My wife, 66666,

285
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
has been fully-finished by Smiling.

286
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
I thought it's okay

287
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
to give Brother Cheng a chance.

288
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
We can work together.

289
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
What's wrong with Brother Cheng and Yang Chen?

290
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
My Smiling is amazing.

291
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Can you show us

292
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
the white car round?

293
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Miss, add one.

294
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Jian Yao said I was a boy

295
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
who was in the school.

296
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Then, I broke up.

297
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Miss, you're out.

298
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Can you see it?

299
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm really in the base.

300
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Why did you break up?

301
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
It's normal to break up

302
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
when young people fall in love.

303
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Why?

304
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Where is Jian Yao?

305
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
In China, Shenzhen,

306
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
and CK training base.

307
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
In my black car.

308
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
You're so childish.

309
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Are you really

310
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
the one who won the K-Ryte team?

311
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Today's training match

312
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
with Fnatic

313
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
is a big advantage.

314
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm still under the middle

315
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
and under the skin.

316
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm a little bit more fit.

317
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Fatty, Brother Cheng, and K

318
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
are on the way to the group chat.

319
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
After the group chat,

320
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Brother Cheng said in a calm tone,

321
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
why don't we

322
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
steal a big snake?

323
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
So they're doing this

324
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:25,100
stealing and

325
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
stealing.

326
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
Maybe they're too

327
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
strong to kill each other.

328
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
They're too much.

329
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
I'm actually the last one

330
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
to beat the snake.

331
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Who's stealing?

332
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
You dare to say it again?

333
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Come on.

334
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
You're making me angry.

335
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Fatty, Brother Cheng, please calm down.

336
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
What's wrong with you two?

337
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
Live well.

338
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Why don't you drink?

339
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Why don't you drink?

340
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
What's the problem?

341
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
We don't have anything, okay?

342
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
What hand-to-hand fight?

343
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Brother Cheng and I

344
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
were the only ones

345
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
on the way to the big road.

346
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
It was the day I just got in the team.

347
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I didn't know the way.

348
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Brother Cheng went to the supermarket with me

349
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
to buy daily necessities.

350
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
What hand-to-hand fight?

351
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
And I'm not a beauty.

352
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Yes, and he's not.

353
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
What did you say?

354
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
It's not what you think.

355
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
I've been in the team for a long time.

356
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
I'll tell you

357
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
when we're together.

358
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Like the one in the bar?

359
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Yes, the one in the bar.

360
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
You're shameless.

361
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
The one with the IDGD

362
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
and the Zha Lie.

363
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
What's the hell?

364
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Just do your work.

365
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
What are you waiting for?

366
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Waiting for your wedding.

367
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Didn't you wear a earring?

368
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
I didn't.

369
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Then who are you going to show it to?

370
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
It's cold in the ear. I'll dance.

371
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
Six, Six, Six.

372
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Little Sister, fighting!

373
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
The match is going to be great.

374
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
It's going to be great.

375
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Let's go eat together.

376
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Let's celebrate the grand final tonight.

377
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Okay, okay.

378
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,100
Let's go eat.

379
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,100
I'm starving.

380
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
A-Z Hotpot?

381
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Can we?

382
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Sure.

383
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Let's go.

384
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
I'll celebrate.

385
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Okay, you go first.

386
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
Old K, do you want to go with us?

387
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
No, I don't.

388
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
I've been on fire recently.

389
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Don't mind him.

390
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
He's just like this.

391
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
He's a play-couple.

392
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Oh my god.

393
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,100
The beef is great.

394
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Rui, help me get two more plates.

395
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
Come on.

396
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
The beef is great.

397
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Oh my god.

398
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
The beef is great.

399
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
I'll give you this.

400
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
You guys...

401
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Why are you eating so fast?

402
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100
It's so hard.

403
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
I'll order two more.

404
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Be careful.

405
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
The beef is slowly gone.

406
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
The mountain is 568 meters high.

407
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
It's in the big sea.

408
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
It's in the big sea.

409
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Okay, okay.

410
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Leave some for me.

411
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Doryang, you're done.

412
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Winter melon.

413
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Winter melon is a little cheaper.

414
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Winter melon 78.

415
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
You're kidding me.

416
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Isn't this a black shop?

417
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Why should I buy a bill that's worth the price?

418
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Okay, I'll tell you.

419
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Tong Yao.

420
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
Why are you standing there?

421
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Hurry up and eat.

422
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,100
I'm not hungry.

423
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
It's too expensive.

424
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
I can't bear to eat.

425
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,100
I saw Brother Cheng

426
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
already gave the credit card to the manager.

427
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
He bought it.

428
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Waiter, give me two fish wings.

429
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
One is enough.

430
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
One is enough.

431
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Child.

432
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Eat more meat.

433
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
You're tall.

434
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Eat more meat.

435
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
Why are there no people?

436
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Let's go.

437
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Look.

438
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
It should be here.

439
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,260
I'm going to ask you something.

440
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Yes.

441
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,860
When I invited you at first,

442
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,500
you didn't want to come, right?

443
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,340
You didn't even agree to come to the hotel.

444
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,180
How did you agree then?

445
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,740
I was quite surprised.

446
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,260
Is it not like that?

447
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,740
At first, I thought that Brother Rui was a liar.

448
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,420
What do you mean by that? He is a liar.

449
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,220
Hu Hu, have you seen such a decent liar?

450
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,020
Miss, I have.

451
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,460
I'm not a liar.

452
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,260
I'm not a liar.

453
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,460
You're a liar.

454
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,580
You're such a decent liar.

455
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,860
Miss, we need to make it clear.

456
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,140
When I invited you,

457
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,780
how did you act like a liar?

458
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,620
You first sent English,

459
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,100
then you sent P.

460
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,820
That's strange.

461
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,340
And I thought,

462
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,900
the name of the DGDX

463
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,820
has always been a T.

464
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,180
Where did he go?

465
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,620
Why did he even look for me?

466
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,660
Then I was more suspicious of you as a liar.

467
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,660
And at the beginning, my parents didn't agree.

468
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,060
At the beginning, my parents didn't agree either.

469
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,220
My parents didn't agree either.

470
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,580
This is normal.

471
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,700
In our team,

472
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,300
except for K,

473
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,780
other parents' attitude is very clear.

474
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,340
It's the opposite.

475
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,860
So I hesitated at the beginning.

476
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,380
Then, what made you think of it?

477
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,940
Because that day, I went to see you and CK playing the game.

478
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,100
I heard the words on the stage.

479
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,940
I decided to be a professional player.

480
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,300
Then I stood on the stage of the world with you.

481
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,260
I took the first card from the world.

482
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,700
Then I took the chest of the world and told everyone who had doubted me.

483
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,940
I, Tong Yang, did it.

484
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,940
Fatty.

485
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,100
Okay, okay.

486
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,700
The dream of Miss Xiang.

487
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,460
Come, let's drink together.

488
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,820
Okay.

489
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
Come.

490
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,220
To the dream of Miss Xiang.

491
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,620
To the dream of Miss Xiang.

492
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,420
Cheers.

493
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,820
Cheers.

494
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,020
Hello.

495
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,420
Is anyone there?

496
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,420
Yes.

497
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,020
Is she going out?

498
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,220
Is anyone there?

499
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
Hello.

500
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Hello.

501
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
Hello.

502
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Hello.

503
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
Hello.

504
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,220
How can you not be friendly?

505
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,420
Isn't the door open?

506
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
Change the key.

507
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,820
What key? Come in.

508
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,620
Is anyone there?

509
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Hello. Is anyone there?

510
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,420
I don't know.

511
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,620
Is anyone there?

512
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Is anyone there?

513
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Big sister, who are you?

514
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
One, one, one, one.

515
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,020
One, one, one, one.

516
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Hello.

517
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
Son, your father started again.

518
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,020
If you take care of him, I will be a grandson.

519
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Junior, you are smiling.

520
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
No, no, no.

521
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
Chinese tradition is beautiful.

522
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
Chinese tradition is beautiful.

523
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
Yes, yes, yes.

524
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,020
Fatty said yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.

525
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,020
What is the junior who knows the society?

526
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
That's Tong Anxin.

527
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
You guys,

528
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,020
remember what I told you today.

529
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
If you forget, I can remind you.

530
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Are you going back to the hospital?

531
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
No matter.

532
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
It's good to be back in a few days.

533
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,020
Let's go.

534
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
Let's go.

535
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
When did you get married?

536
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
You don't know?

537
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
I know he is rich.

538
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
Not just rich.

539
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,020
The record company has heard about it.

540
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
The big boss is there.

541
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,020
Their poor family only has money left.

542
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
According to the script,

543
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,020
shouldn't he go to the record company?

544
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,020
I feel like his parents are very supportive.

545
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
They even play the computer.

546
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
I heard that they didn't support him at the beginning.

547
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Later, they didn't know what to do.

548
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Anyway, when I came,

549
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
their family was already a team of shareholders.

550
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
They bought it.

551
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
What are you talking about?

552
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
No, no, no.

553
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Come on.

554
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
I'm a new step.

555
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
Fatty.

556
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
We didn't talk about anything.

557
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,020
We were just talking about your parents' support for you to play the computer.

558
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
What's the good thing about that?

559
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Your family doesn't support you to play the computer?

560
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
My dad is fine.

561
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,020
My mom is...

562
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
If my dad was in our family,

563
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
it would be great.

564
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
But my dad is like your dad.

565
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
He goes to the...

566
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
I'm going to the country.

567
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
The country.

568
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
Don't you think that your husband will go to the country?

569
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
Why?

570
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
It's the same world and the same dream.

571
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
I...

572
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
I'm leaving, kid.

573
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,020
Wait for me.

574
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
You can't get out of the car.

575
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,020
I'm going to the record company.

576
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,020
Lu Si Cheng.

577
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
Why are you all standing here?

578
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,020
Dad.

579
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,020
Mom.

580
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
You're still drinking?

581
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
I'm not.

582
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,020
Mom.

583
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
Ju Hua Tea.

584
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,020
It's a warm, lively, detoxifying drink.

585
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Have a drink.

586
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Stop this.

587
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Are we here to drink tea?

588
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,020
Yes.

589
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
You...

590
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
No.

591
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,020
What's going on?

592
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
You're from the Xiaobun family.

593
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
Why are you drinking?

594
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,020
Didn't you say that you're here to work?

595
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,020
How did you promise me that you'd work as a witness when you left?

596
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
Look at you now.

597
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
You're here to drink wine?

598
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
Your witness work is to go out and drink at night.

599
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Did they bring you here?

600
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Do you know what their background is?

601
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,020
They're always with them.

602
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,020
Who's that Chessman?

603
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
Mom.

604
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,020
You don't know what the background is now.

605
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
Stop talking nonsense.

606
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
I'm telling you the witness.

607
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
You've only been here for a few days.

608
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
You're just making trouble.

609
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
You're just making trouble.

610
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
What's the internet saying now?

611
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
You and that Chessman...

612
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,020
What's going on?

613
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
Bai Shezhuang is here.

614
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,020
I call you every time.

615
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,020
I can't take it.

616
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,020
Can I not worry about your dad?

617
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,020
What's the difference between the computer and me?

618
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,020
The difference is too big.

619
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
For example, this is a sample.

620
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,020
It's customized by personal habits and personal preferences.

621
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
Do you think so, Old Tong?

622
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
And this is a chicken box.

623
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
Yes.

624
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
What's the difference?

625
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,020
It's cold inside.

626
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,020
Old Tong.

627
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Your mom is right.

628
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,020
What does cold mean?

629
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
Cold means hot.

630
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
Mom.

631
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,020
I'm doing well here.

632
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,020
What can I do?

633
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,020
The news I sent you.

634
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
You didn't even look at it.

635
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,020
Dad.

636
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Your mom is right.

637
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
You have to listen to your mom.

638
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,020
Uncle and auntie, look.

639
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,020
These are the comments from the netizens.

640
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,020
I'm sorry.

641
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
I'm sorry to trouble you.

642
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
It's okay, sister.

643
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
Look.

644
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,020
Everyone has taken good care of your parents.

645
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
It's dark.

646
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
It's dark.

647
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
You have to look at it.

648
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
This one is enough.

649
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,020
Not bad.

650
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
It's an accident.

651
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
I promise.

652
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,020
Take these two gods away as soon as possible.

653
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
I promise.

654
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Sister, you didn't drink much last night.

655
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,020
Why didn't you listen to the ninth brother?

656
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
Here, have a sip.

657
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
I'm not ninth brother.

658
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
It's the sixth.

659
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
This is mine.

660
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
It's mine.

661
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
I understand.

662
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,020
It's normal for parents to come and see.

663
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,020
I think everyone should cooperate with her.

664
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
Smile together.

665
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
Uncle and auntie,

666
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,020
leave a good impression.

667
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
Uncle, this way.

668
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
This is all we can reward.

669
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Forget it.

670
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
You can just stay at the park.

671
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,020
Xiao Qi.

672
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
So many.

673
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
How about it, Xiao Qi?

674
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
Look at this.

675
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,020
It's mine.

676
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,020
Hurry up and take these two gods away.

677
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,020
I'll buy her a month's cool skin.

678
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,020
It's ZGDX training base.

679
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
It's not a performance training class.

680
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
I don't have time to cooperate with your performance.

681
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
It's so troublesome.

682
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,020
I won't let your parents take you back.

683
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
Okay.

684
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
Yaoyao.

685
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,020
What are you guys talking about?

686
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020
What will you take back?

687
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
Nothing, auntie.

688
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
Mom, it's late now.

689
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,020
You have to say that I have to get up tomorrow morning, right?

690
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
I'll go to bed.

691
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,020
I'm not sleepy yet.

692
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,020
You're going to go?

693
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,020
Hurry up.

694
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
I'm going to bed.

695
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
I'm going to bed too.

696
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,020
I'm going to bed.

697
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,020
Okay.

698
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,020
Uncle, have some mangoes.

699
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,020
Give it to me.

700
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,020
Yes.

701
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,020
I'll take them for you.

702
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
Okay.

703
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
Bye.

704
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,020
Bye.

705
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Bye.

706
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,020
I have to take care of auntie.

707
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
I'll take care of her.

708
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
Yaoyao.

709
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,020
If you're not happy here,

710
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
come back with me tomorrow.

711
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,020
Mom, how do you know that I'm not happy?

712
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
You...

713
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Old Tong.

714
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
I don't want to leave.

715
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Yaoyao.

716
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Mom.

717
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,020
Dad.

718
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,020
I know you're worried about me.

719
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,020
But I'm doing well here.

720
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Really.

721
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
I'm not used to it.

722
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,020
Although I'm not used to it,

723
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,020
I really want to be a professional electrician.

724
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,020
So I have to overcome it.

725
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
I know you're worried about me.

726
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,020
You want to arrange a stable job for me.

727
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,020
But I'm sure

728
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,020
I don't want to do that job.

729
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
If you don't like the job of the bank,

730
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,020
let's find another one.

731
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
Mom.

732
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,020
I know you're doing well for me.

733
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,020
But I'm going to the place where you arranged it.

734
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,020
I'm doing a job that I don't like.

735
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020
I'm married to someone who doesn't like it,

736
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
who doesn't like it,

737
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
and who doesn't like it.

738
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
Then I have a baby.

739
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
I'm always stable until I retire.

740
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
Lin Liangmu is writing on the name.

741
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,020
This is a normal person who has never been happy

742
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
in a stable life.

743
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
Such a life is meaningless.

744
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
Mom.

745
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
Mom.

746
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
I'm already a year old.

747
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,020
So I'm not joking.

748
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,020
I'm not trying to be honest.

749
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
I'm serious about learning

750
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,020
how to be a professional electrician.

751
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,020
Maybe one day,

752
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,020
your daughter can stand on the stage of the world competition

753
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
and win a world champion.

754
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,020
You're beautiful.

755
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,020
Maybe.

756
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
Dad.

757
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Tell her.

758
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
Mom.

759
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,020
What?

760
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
Your mom is right.

761
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
You...

762
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,020
have a point.

763
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,020
I was right.

764
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
The three months are over.

765
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,020
I hope you can let me stay until then.

766
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
If I don't get used to it,

767
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,020
or if I don't fit here,

768
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
I'll go home.

769
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,020
Dad.

770
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,020
Dad.

771
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,020
We're still the same.

772
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,020
We're a couple.

773
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,020
We're a couple.

774
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
We're a couple.

775
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
What do you think?

776
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,020
Fine.

777
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,020
We're a couple.

778
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
We're a couple.

779
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
I know that

780
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,020
my dad is the most open-minded and the most honest.

781
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
Thank you, dad.

782
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,020
Of course.

783
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,020
My mom is more open-minded and honest.

784
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
I...

785
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Enough.

786
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Don't be so obedient.

787
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Let me tell you the truth.

788
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,020
The one on the Internet,

789
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,020
who is the chassman?

790
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
Is he interested in you?

791
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,020
The chassman

792
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,020
is not like a teacher.

793
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
He needs to be careful.

794
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
Mom.

795
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
I've said it many times.

796
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,020
It's a misunderstanding.

797
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
Don't talk too much.

798
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
Don't talk too much.

799
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
Don't talk too much.

800
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,020
Misunderstanding?

801
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
What misunderstanding?

802
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,020
You think your mom doesn't understand anything, right?

803
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Let me tell you.

804
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm a teacher.

805
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
All the people I know are young people.

806
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Dad.

807
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,020
Your mom makes sense.

808
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
Brother Cheng.

809
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
Xiaorui just cleaned up the room.

810
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,020
I'll take uncle and aunt to sleep.

811
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,020
Thank you, brother Cheng.

812
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,020
Oh, right, dad.

813
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,020
Let me introduce you.

814
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,020
This is our team leader,

815
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Lu Si Cheng.

816
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Brother Cheng.

817
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,020
He is a good person.

818
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,020
Hello, uncle and aunt.

819
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,020
The room is clean.

820
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,020
You are all alone.

821
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,020
You are in a hurry.

822
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,020
No, no.

823
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,020
We are not invited.

824
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
Sorry to bother you.

825
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,020
Yes.

826
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
By the way, uncle and aunt.

827
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,020
I forgot to introduce.

828
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
I have another name.

829
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,020
Is this Chessman?

830
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,020
Okay.

831
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,020
Okay, okay.

832
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,020
Chessman.

833
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,020
Uncle, let me take it.

834
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,020
Sorry.

835
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
It's okay.

836
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Thank you.

837
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Uncle and aunt, this way please.

838
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,020
Let's go.

839
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,020
Take a rest.

840
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Okay.

841
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Okay.

842
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
See you tomorrow morning.

843
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,020
See you tomorrow morning.

844
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,020
Tong Yao, come on.

845
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,020
Okay.

846
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
My love.

847
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,020
My love.

848
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,020
My love.
