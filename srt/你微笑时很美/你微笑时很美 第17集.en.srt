00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,440
Esports Farm never spreads false gossip.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,870
I am your one and only true gossip queen.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,900
Recently, the esports industry has been full of new gossip.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,320
Lu Sicheng, the esports heartthrob,

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,560
has unexpectedly become

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,220
the subject of steamy rumors.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,810
Smiling!

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,120
FNC's jungler, Kun,

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,790
was spotted in the audience.

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,990
Considering the last time he blindly ganked Smiling,

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,630
we have every reason to suspect

12
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,110
something's going on between them.

13
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,870
Miss, you're very cute.

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,310
Of course,

15
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,490
the most shocking moment

16
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,150
was Cheng's jaw-dropping embrace on the field.

17
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,670
And there's the solo match between ZGDX's double carries.

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,930
Come on, Shorty, let's have a solo match.

19
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,090
So,

20
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,700
who exactly is he going to publicly admit is his girlfriend?

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,050

[Episode 17]

23
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,990
What?

24
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,750
I just accidentally took a nap.

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,470
How did I miss

26
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,000
such a dramatic solo match?

27
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,750
Gosh, Jinyang, my ears almost went deaf.

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,050
Then what happened?

29
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,630
What happened after you beat Cheng?

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,430
Don't tell me you chickened out.

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,400
I knew Lu Sicheng must like you.

32
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,360
He must have let you win on purpose.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,940
Do you think so too?

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,350
In romance novels and in the eyes of fans,

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,940
that's exactly how it seemed.

36
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,090
It felt like he intentionally lost to me.

37
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,230
But the thing is,

38
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,760
when I was laning against him,

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,829
I could feel that

40
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,630
he wasn't holding back at allâ€”

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
he just wanted to beat me.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,470
I guess I won

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,790
because I'm more familiar with the mid-lane minion wave

44
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,590
and map positioning.

45
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,060
Come on.

46
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,910
Keep pretending. I'm hanging up.

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,630
No, it's true.

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,370
And...

49
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,930
Never mind.

50
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,970
I'm not sure what happened either.

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
I told you

52
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,600
not to casually set a flag

53
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,230
saying you wouldn't date a pro player.

54
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,120
Saying things like that will come back to haunt you.

55
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,820
What about Cheng?

56
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,070
What did he say?

57
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,390
After your solo match, you didn't even ask him anything?

58
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,470
What should I ask?

59
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,870
We're teammates.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,750
What if...

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,130
I did something inappropriate

62
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
and got rejected?

63
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,970
How am I supposed to play with him after that?

64
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,030
It'd be so awkward.

65
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,050
You're overthinking it.

66
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,540
Ai Jia and I didn't think that much back then.

67
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,180
We are teammates.

68
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,570
Compared to things with uncertain outcomes,

69
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,970
I'd rather just focus on playing well in the matches.

70
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,579
I really don't want people to say

71
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,030
that girls who play professionally

72
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,340
are just in it for the fame or to date.

73
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,150
Alright, sis.

74
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,260
I'm starting to feel sorry for you.

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,470
Who would've thought

76
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,590
that our silly girl

77
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,829
has grown up?

78
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,610
What else?

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,600
However,

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,470
as someone who's been through this, I want to give you a piece of advice.

81
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,900
In this situation,

82
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,550
women shouldn't act impulsively.

83
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,030
A man can't hold back when he has feelings for you.

84
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,740
Really?

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,750
But,

86
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,840
if he doesn't make a move for a long time,

87
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,550
then...

88
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,310
it's very likely you're just overthinking it.

89
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,150
Okay.

90
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,060
Bye.

91
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,510
Cheng, you haven't left yet?

92
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,400
Didn't you say

93
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,600
your blind date

94
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,360
asked to meet you one last time?

95
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,050
What time is it now?

96
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,260
Why aren't you getting ready to go out?

97
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,300
What's wrong?

98
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,650
You're not going?

99
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,230
Didn't someone say she didn't want me to go?

100
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,600
Who's so nosy?

101
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,900
You heard that?

102
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,020
I'm not deaf.

103
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,550
Then why did you pretend...

104
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,680
I have some dignity.

105
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,530
I was just saying it casually.

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,460
I was mainly worried about you getting distracted.

107
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,320
Think about it.

108
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,310
All of our teammates

109
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,840
hope we can win the championship this year...

110
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,280
and... and get the championship skin...

111
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,909
and get revenge on Pope.

112
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,300
Pancake?

113
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,670
Here you are.

114
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,320
Let's go.

115
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,480
Let's eat some canned food.

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,050
What?

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,710
What were you talking about?

118
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,110
Getting revenge on Pope?

119
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,360
Nothing.

120
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,780
I'm going back to my room now.

121
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,900
You're not going out?

122
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,510
No.

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,380
You're standing her up again?

124
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,900
I changed the location to the training base entrance.

125
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,630
That way, I don't need to drive.

126
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,870
There's no love in esports.

127
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,230
Our goal this year is the national championship.

128
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,030
Glad you know.

129
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,990
Let's go, Pancake.

130
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,520
Let's eat some canned food.

131
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,159
Cheng.

132
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,409
You intentionally lost the solo match, didn't you?

133
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,940
Why would I lose on purpose?

134
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,140
God Yang told me.

135
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,790
Then why did you lose?

136
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,780
Do I need to explain to you

137
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,910
why I failed?

138
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,740
Should I write you an 800-word self-critique?

139
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,720
The whole world could see

140
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,290
that you lost it on purpose.

141
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,390
No.

142
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,050
I miscalculated the minion wave distance,

143
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,290
and she took advantage of the opportunity.

144
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,290
That mistake doesn't seem like something you'd make.

145
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,610
At least, I've never seen you make it.

146
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,300
I'm not a god. I make mistakes too.

147
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,890
Besides,

148
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,350
why would I intentionally lose to her?

149
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,630
I don't know.

150
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,870
But anyway,

151
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,140
I saw gentleness.

152
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,450
You're blind.

153
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,670
Our mid laner

154
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,090
can't see through such a profound strategy.

155
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,880
Besides,

156
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,790
she won.

157
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,270
Now she's focused on how to replace me

158
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,390
and take over the team.

159
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,970
Being gentle with her

160
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,510
-is being cruel to myself.
-What? What did he say?

161
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,140
He's saying one thing and thinking another.

162
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,750
I really don't understand you men.

163
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,750
Why do you like to play these games

164
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,080
of saying one thing and thinking another?

165
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,460
Your behavior is no different from the little boys

166
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,450
in kindergarten

167
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,720
who like to tug on the braids

168
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,010
of the girls they like.

169
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm leaving.

170
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,150
Let's go.

171
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,250
What?

172
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,400
Is someone coming to see you later too?

173
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,320
No.

174
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,550
I'm just checking the weather.

175
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,240
Aren't we going out for late-night snacks later?

176
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
No need. We can just bring them back.

177
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,470
Miss Su.

178
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,870
I've already told you last time.

179
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,000
We're not suitable.

180
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,590
Lu Sicheng,

181
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,270
are you upset

182
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,820
that I went to watch you at the match?

183
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,230
Do you think I was too high-profile?

184
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,830
I really didn't mean it.

185
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,350
I just answered their questions as they asked.

186
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,110
I didn't know you were so famous.

187
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,310
And I didn't expect them

188
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,470
to analyze everything I said.

189
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,330
Now, your fans

190
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,910
are going crazy.

191
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,110
I'm really sorry.

192
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,780
They even found my Weibo account.

193
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,290
Some people are saying really harsh things,

194
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,440
like that...

195
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,820
I'm shameless,

196
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,910
pretending to be your girlfriend.

197
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,410
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,530
Why are you apologizing?

199
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,800
It's not your fault.

200
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,150
It's your fans' fault.

201
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,150
Although I don't know much about things

202
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,710
in the gaming world,

203
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,370
if we can develop a relationship,

204
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,910
I'm willing to learn and understand.

205
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,760
It has nothing to do with that.

206
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,390
I don't know if Lu Yue told you

207
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,360
some nonsense

208
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,470
about how there are rules in this industry

209
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,670
or whatever.

210
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,860
Just ignore that.

211
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,160
The truth is, if I want a girl,

212
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,670
I'll protect her.

213
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,830
So it has nothing to do with that.

214
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,930
So you are afraid of hurting your fans' feelings?

215
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,810
I'm not an idol in the entertainment industry.

216
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,010
I'm an esports player, not a monk.

217
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,980
So what is it?

218
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,270
We're not suitable.

219
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,150
How are we not suitable?

220
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,160
Family background,

221
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,620
appearance, intelligence, or height?

222
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,940
Give me a hug.

223
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,080
They can even be together.

224
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,860
Isn't that good?

225
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,880
Bye.

226
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,200
He's much older

227
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,220
than this girl.

228
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,280
What kind of person do you like anyway?

229
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,460
Someone who's better than me at games.

230
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,080
Isn't that just a publicity stunt?

231
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,810
No, it's not.

232
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,020
But does such a person even exist?

233
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,870
I heard you're really good at games.

234
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,390
No one's better than you.

235
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,070
It doesn't have to be Onmyoji Arena.

236
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,200
Someone who's better than me

237
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,030
at Tetris would be fine.

238
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,570
But if it's Onmyoji Arena,

239
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,790
I'd just marry her straight away.

240
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,320
Goodbye.

241
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,270
Why hasn't Cheng come back yet?

242
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,080
That restaurant is super popular, if we're late, they'll run out of food.

243
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,030
Yeah, what's he doing?

244
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,750
It's been 20 minutes.

245
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,200
Exactly, I'm starving.

246
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,310
No. I need to check on them.

247
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,370
What are you doing?

248
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,310
Your performance this month is at risk.

249
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,610
Come on, let's play ranked.

250
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,770
Come on.

251
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,730
-I'm starving.
-No.

252
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,270
It's all your fault for dragging me to the gym.

253
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,000
Just play ranked while we wait.

254
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,060
How about I go and take a look?

255
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,710
Okay, go.

256
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,730
What are you looking at? Log in.

257
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,030
You guys play, I'll watch.

258
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,130
Come on, I'm too hungry to play.

259
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,720
What's wrong? Are you scared by a ghost again?

260
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,910
Pang said he's hungry.

261
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,670
He asked me to hurry you up to get the crayfish.

262
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,180
Um...

263
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,990
Where's your blind date?

264
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,310
She left?

265
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,430
She left.

266
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,490
Come on. Let's drive to buy the crayfish.

267
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,750
We have to drive there?

268
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,240
That restaurant is in the south of the city.

269
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,740
You should've said that earlier. If I'd known, I wouldn't have come out.

270
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,270
I didn't ask you to come out.

271
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,570
You...

272
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,010
Sir,

273
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,620
you ordered so many crawfish.

274
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Are you hosting friends at home with your girlfriend?

275
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,710
She's not my girlfriend.

276
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,770
She's my teammate.

277
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,610
Teammate?

278
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,070
The way she looks at you

279
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,270
is how a woman looks at

280
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,750
her boyfriend or husband.

281
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,500
She must like you.

282
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,830
If you don't like her, just tell her.

283
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,470
Don't break her heart.

284
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:51,980
Let's go.

285
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,020
What were you talking about with the waitress?

286
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,420
You were smiling so sweetly.

287
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,770
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

288
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,950
Did she give you a discount?

289
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,590
No.

290
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,080
Then why were you smiling so happily?

291
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,920
She said you look at me the way

292
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,450
a girl looks at her boyfriend, totally obsessed.

293
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,380
Impossible.

294
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,250
Waitresses are not that bored.

295
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,360
Let's take a break.

296
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,550
What's wrong?

297
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,890
Your hand hurts?

298
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,670
Your hand got injured?

299
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,950
It's normal to have a little hand injury

300
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,070
after playing professionally for a long time,

301
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,230
especially as an AD.

302
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,250
It's just strain.

303
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,170
As long as I don't carry heavy things,

304
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:26,930
it's...

305
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,610
What are you doing?

306
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,980
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you have a hand injury?

307
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,580
There's nothing to say about it.

308
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,420
I have a strain injury. I'm not disabled.

309
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,890
Give them to me.

310
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,650
No need.

311
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,870
I've carried gas tanks for my mom at home.

312
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,780
I'm not that fragile.

313
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,980
Just wait for me here.

314
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,620
Um...

315
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,760
Lu Sicheng, open the door.

316
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,060
This is really something new.

317
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,820
What?

318
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,430
It's the first time I've been taken care of by a little girl.

319
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,580
But I'm not a little girl.

320
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:17,990
Anyway,

321
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,780
thank you.

322
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,570
Let's go.

323
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,600
Buckle up.

324
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,450
Cheng,

325
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,869
did you intentionally lose that solo match?

326
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,130
What do you think?

327
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,859
I don't think so.

328
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,460
You're not a little girl who needs to be coddled like that.

329
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,470
As if you understand

330
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,030
this kind of game.

331
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,990
It was like talking to a brick wall.

332
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,870
I understand it.

333
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,090
I have a girlish heart.

334
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,690
You don't.

335
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,050
You do.

336
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,400
Cheng.

337
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,750
What?

338
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,780
I...

339
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,350
I...

340
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,230
You need to arrange your training time properly

341
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,490
to avoid worsening your hand injury.

342
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,920
The team hires a physiotherapist every month for massages.

343
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,030
Cheng.

344
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,700
I think I...

345
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,560
Do you want to listen to some music?

346
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,430
Don't rush.

347
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,760
Everything you want

348
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,170
will come.

349
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,980
Look here.

350
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,940
At least 5 kilograms of these are all mine.

351
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,100
And this row.

352
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,610
Rio.

353
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,870
This is our mid laner's favorite thing.

354
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,980
Our mid laner said before

355
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,270
that Rio and crayfish are a perfect match.

356
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,900
Well said.

357
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,730
Turn the camera a bit.

358
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,920
Let me look at others.

359
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,870
I don't want to look at you, you fatso.

360
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,230
Fatso? Watch your language.

361
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,360
You said things like that, and you expect me to turn the camera for you?

362
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,950
You're a fatso.

363
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,210
Let me show you.

364
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,360
This crayfish

365
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,420
costs about 150 or 160 per half a kilo.

366
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,050
Before it's cooked, the bubbles it spits out are colorful.

367
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,200
It must be food poisoning or something.

368
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Feels like hormones.

369
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,240
You...

370
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,410
Alright, alright.

371
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,950
I'm done talking to you guys.

372
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,170
Livestreaming is slowing down my crayfish eating.

373
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:15,970
Don't forget.

374
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,440
Keep the gifts coming.

375
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,490
Why aren't you eating?

376
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,750
He thinks it's too much trouble.

377
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,320
Plus, it leaves a lingering smell on your hands.

378
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,730
The odor lasts for days.

379
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,340
It's so uncomfortable.

380
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,840
Look how much he cares about his image.

381
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,410
Unless you peel the crayfish

382
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,140
and put them in his bowl for him.

383
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,230
He thinks he's eating Boston lobster,

384
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,690
with someone serving him.

385
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,830
You watched me peel it.

386
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,110
I didn't poison it.

387
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,580
Forget it.

388
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,840
Have a sip of Rio.

389
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,880
Hurry up.

390
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:07,760
Hurry up.

391
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,760
How is it? I told you, didn't I?

392
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,380
Why is Cheng so obedient?

393
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,210
Want some more?

394
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,990
You like peeling crayfish for others?

395
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,160
I was just about to say that. Even if you want more, I won't do it.

396
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,020
You paid for them.

397
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,810
We should at least let you have a taste.

398
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,850
It's a courtesy.

399
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,110
So disrespectful.

400
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,060
Cheng.

401
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,810
You two had a solo match during the day,

402
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,060
then fed each other crayfish and flirted at night.

403
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,320
What a perfect couple.

404
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,210
Pang, do you dare to turn the camera around

405
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,190
so we can see what's happening over there?

406
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,830
I'm not turning it. My hands are greasy. I can't turn it.

407
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,610
You guys can hit me.

408
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,990
Who is the perfect couple?

409
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,190
You should just watch me.

410
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,900
Who wants to watch you, you fatso?

411
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,510
Shut up!

412
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
The club called me.

413
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,930
They want us to attend an event.

414
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,500
But there's a match on the weekend. We can't go to the event.

415
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,090
Cheng,

416
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,430
you've turned Su Luo down so many times lately.

417
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,470
Now Mrs. Lu is mad

418
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,760
and taking it out on the club.

419
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,920
I've turned down all the other events I could,

420
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,740
but the contract for this Saturday's Dimension Anime Expo,

421
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,790
which is in another city, has already been signed.

422
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,380
So...

423
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,410
With the schedule packed with matches afterward,

424
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,180
how can we go out of town on Saturday?

425
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,910
Are we going and coming back the same day?

426
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,870
The club's plan

427
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,220
is for us to go straight to the airport after the match,

428
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,340
attend the event on Saturday,

429
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,270
and then fly back afterward.

430
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,070
Can we skip it?

431
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,570
You'll have to talk to Mrs. Lu.

432
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,110
Tell the club

433
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,490
this is the last time.

We left two hours earlier.

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,700
I didn't even have breakfast. I'm starving.

439
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,940
I'm really sorry about this.

440
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,510
Mostly because I was worried about traffic,

441
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,460
so I moved everything up.

442
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,550
Breakfast!

443
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,350
Rui,

444
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,540
you've finally grown a conscience

445
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,230
and realized I didn't have breakfast.

446
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,870
-I'm starving.
-What are you talking about?

447
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm demonstrating a point

If we have Paninis this good every day,

00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,600
I swear I could quit oversleeping.

452
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,310
If a breakfast could keep you from oversleeping,

453
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,910
I'm really

454
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,100
willing to be your breakfast butler.

What are you doing?

458
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm taking a picture to send to the official blog manager.

459
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,310
So she can reach out

-Cheng! Cheng!

466

I'm sorry, excuse me.

467
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,750
We're doing makeup. Sorry.

468
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,870
Cheng, could you sign an autograph for me?

469
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,150
Please sign an autograph for me!

470
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,890
Cheng, can you sign an autograph for us?

471
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,350
No, they're doing makeup.

472
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,020
Cheng, just one autograph, please.

473
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,990
Just one autograph.

474

Cheng got up so early today.

480
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,710
I didn't expect him to be so patient.

481
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,170
Cheng is experienced in this.

482
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,340
Does he want to be criticized by ignorant fans?

483
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,220
Is he too aloof?

484
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,410
Cheng, mine, mine. Thank you.

485
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,330
I want one too.

Could you sign an autograph for me, please?

Cheng, please sign an autograph for me.

Please sign mine here.

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,070
Thank you.

512
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,710
Miss, please sign an autograph for me.

513
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,550
And this one too.

514
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,220
Thank you.

515
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,750
Thank you, Cheng.

516
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,860
Thank you, Cheng. Thank you, Miss.

517
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,720
Sign one for me too. I want one too.

518
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,980
Miss, could you sign one for me too?

519
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,240
Miss, please sign an autograph for me.

520
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,350
Thank you, Miss.

521
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,570
You've come three times already.

522
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,420
The last one was for me.

523
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,120
This one is for my friend.

524
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,740
It won't take much of your time anyway.

525
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,940
Please sign it, okay?

526
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,340
Cheng.

527
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,510
Cheng, please sign an autograph for me.

528
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,710
Rui.

529
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,900
What's wrong?

530
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,650
She's been here three times already.

531
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,820
Will this ever end?

532
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,700
Okay, I'll deal with it.

533
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,170
Excuse me.

534
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,710
We need to finish our makeup, and there's no time left.

535
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,840
How about we stop it?

536
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,020
It's just an autograph.

537
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,370
Why do you make such a big deal out of it?

538
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,900
Why are you putting on airs?

539
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,970
Well done.

540
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,580
These people just want to show off to their friends.

541
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,870
"I can go backstage and see so-and-so.

542
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,570
Want me to grab an autograph for you?"

543
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,430
Then they'd come for autographs.

544
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,570
Honestly,

545
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,590
they probably don't even know what you do.

546
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,650
They just know you're famous gamers.

547
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,600
I'm done with your hair. I'm leaving now.

548
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,560
Are you eating or not?

549
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,870
I'm on a diet.

550
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,960
Well, I'll eat yours.

551
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,000
A girl playing professionally? She must be staff.

552
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,390
I think I know who you're talking about.

553
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,400
Power goes to her head.

554
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,940
To be honest, I've never liked her.

555
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,610
I've never liked her.

556
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,460
Everyone, please take a look.

557
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,870
Here's the event schedule,

558
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,660
including some

559
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,010
interactive segments where we need your cooperation.

560
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,470
Thank you.

561
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,470
Also, please get ready for the game.

562
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,390
Having the team members carry the show girls in a princess carry

563
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,950
from the left side of the stage to the right side?

564
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,490
The first show girl to strike the gong with the hammer

565
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,820
wins?

566
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,030
I saw it.

567
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,900
It's completely meaningless, just for show.

568
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,920
Rui,

569
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,220
have you seen this schedule?

570
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,980
What kind of game is this?

571
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,260
Don't worry. Let me take a look.

572
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,760
It's...

573
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,500
Stop looking.

574
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,830
Isn't it a bit inappropriate for us

575
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,680
to be carried around like this while dressed like this?

576
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,880
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

577
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,340
These skirts are way too short.

578
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,070
We all make a living with our hands.

579
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,730
And we all have hand injuries.

580
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,270
Isn't this a bit much?

581
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,430
This game

582
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,050
has a bad influence on us.

583
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,820
It could damage our image.

584
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,080
How about we change it?

585
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,630
We've already prepared the game props.

586
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,230
And the timing is just right.

587
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,900
Now, you're suddenly saying you want to change it.

588
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,880
Isn't that inappropriate?

589
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,780
Come on. It's...

590
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,160
It's just a quick thing. It'll be over soon.

591
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,560
We have a match tomorrow.

592
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,490
What if someone gets injured?

593
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,350
Who will replace them? Will you?

594
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,110
Girl,

595
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,710
you've been sulking since the beginning.

596
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,670
You're just looking for trouble, aren't you?

597
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,870
Haven't I already told you?

598
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,040
The props are ready, and the timing is scheduled.

599
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,300
We can't change it now.

600
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,550
Come on.

601
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,350
Listen to me.

602
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,350
Our team members do have hand injuries.

603
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,240
Ifâ€¦

604
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,140
We're all here for the money.

605
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,170
Don't act like you're more noble than the rest of us.

606
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,840
If you're so unwilling,

607
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,520
then you shouldn't have come.

608
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,810
Don't take the organizer's money

609
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,640
and then cause trouble here.

610
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,050
Do you guys in esports

611
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,140
always make things so difficult?

612
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,340
My boyfriend is also an esports player.

613
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,840
I've never seen him act like you guys,

614
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,370
too precious to be touched.

615
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,010
A bunch of grown men

616
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,360
are acting like it'll kill you to carry some girls

617
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,020
who weigh a few dozen kilos and walk on the stage.

618
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,080
Do you want me to post on Weibo

619
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,590
that your team members are all snowflakes?

620
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,990
What are you doing?

621
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,670
What are you saying? Who are you threatening?

622
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,090
Alright, alright.

623
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,960
Who's threatening you?

624
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,550
Don't get angry.

625
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,190
There's no need for this.

626
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,930
Don't touch me!

Cat, are you okay?

628
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,810
How could you hit him?

629
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,510
Miss!

630
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,040
Who do you think you are to hit me?

631
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,370
Are you planning to extort us?

632
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,580
How could you hit me?

633
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,800
Lu Sicheng, let go.

634
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,480
Calm down, Miss.

635
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,190
Let go!

636
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,160
How can there be a professional player like you?

637
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,700
What are you doing?

638
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
Are you going to hit a woman?

639
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,300
Did I hit you?

640
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,170
You're the only woman here?

641
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,540
Am I a man?

642
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,640
Who are you anyway?

643
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,110
-Tong Yao!
-Tong Yao!

644

The room is full of people.

645
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,310
Let go of me!

646
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,540
Don't stop me!

647
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,070
Are you done?

648
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,740
It's okay. It's okay now.

649
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,820
Let's go.

650
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,420
It's alright.

651
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,450
Don't be angry. It's not worth getting mad at her.

652
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,580
Except for Tong Yao,

653
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,140
everyone else go to the event venue right away.

654
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,950
Calm down.

655
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,350
Now,

your favorite Team ZGDX,

657
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,030
is starting their match.

658
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,830
Are you two ready?

659
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,700
Yes.

660
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,950
Okay.

661
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,810
Get set.

662
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,770
Go!

663
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,170
Go, Pang!

664
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,060
Come on!

665
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,930
Come on!

666
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,510
Alright, Cat won!

667
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,630
Let's welcome Chessman, Cheng and K to the stage!

668
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:50,320

It's okay now.

671
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,510
My friend has come to pick me up.

672
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,140
There were a lot of people on site.

673

Thank you all for your concern.

I know a normal girl

would never be a pro player.

00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,680
Why did she hit you anyway?

681
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,390
What did you say?

682
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:21,930
I...

683
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,660
I just emphasized

684
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,070
that the organizers

685
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,010
paid them to perform.

686
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,180
This mid laner of ZGDX

687
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,320
has a habit of fighting when things don't go her way?

688
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,030
What's wrong with her?

689
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,880
Impressive.

690
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,460
Women fighting is especially thrilling to watch.

691
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,290
No matter what the reason was, it was too much.

692
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,160
I'm glad you're okay.

693
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,320
Jiaqi is so gentle.

694
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,590
Judging by Tong Yao's appearance,

695
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,920
you can tell she's rude.

696
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,300
With all your care and support,

697
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,450
I... I'll recover quickly.

698
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,880
Thank you.

699
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,230
Gosh.

700
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,290
Is this the most talked-about Esports Mulan right now?

701
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,890
She has a fiery temper.

702
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,540
She hits people at the slightest provocation.

703
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,750
We've been waiting for a month,

704
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,670
and when we finally get to see her,

705
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,310
it's about fighting?

706
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
She hit people for no reason.

707
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,430
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

708
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,480
It's me again.

709
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,790
Can you help me out

710
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,449
and block some keywords for me?

711
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,900
Yes, about that fight.

712
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,980
No problem, no problem.

713
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,590
I'll send you an official letter.

714
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,630
Okay, okay, thank you.

715
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,639
Mr. Zhang, it was not like what they are saying online.

716
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,510
This was our fault.

717
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,150
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,580
I'm really sorry.

719
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,960
We'll resolve it as soon as possible.

720
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,090
Please don't worry.

721
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,630
Mr. Li.

722
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,540
You're here.

723
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,360
I've been waiting for you.

724
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,250
Mrs. Wang will be here soon.

725
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,980
You can talk to her yourselves.

726
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:36,940
Lu...

727
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,639
Mrs. Wang is coming in person?

728
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,840
I thought...

729
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,780
What?

730
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,980
Do you think this matter isn't big enough?

731
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,699
No, no.

732
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,660
Mrs. Wang.

733
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,650
Mrs. Wang.

734
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,900
You must be Tong Yao.

735
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,820
It's our first meeting.

736
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,220
Let me introduce myself.

737
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,130
My name is Wang Lan,

738
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,820
the executive director of ZGDX

739
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,070
sent by Lu Group.

740
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,270
I also have another identity that they all know.

741
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,110
I'm also Lu Sicheng and Lu Yue's mother.

742
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,660
Mrs. Lu?

743
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,940
Mrs. Wang, please carry on. I'll take my leave.

744
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,030
Mrs. Wang, please let me explain.

745
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,750
This really isn't Tong Yao's fault.

746
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,550
That woman was clearly just looking for trouble.

747
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,970
Besides, we have a lot of matches scheduled recently,

748
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,830
and Cheng's hand injury flared up again.

749
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,070
Carrying those girls

750
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,830
and running

751
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,990
would make his hand injury worse

752
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,470
and affect the match, which would be even worse.

753
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,070
Tong Yao was just concerned about Cheng.

754
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,220
-So she...
-Some people say

755
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,190
the mid laner of ZGDX put on airs.

756
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,050
No. I didn't.

757
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,420
And some people say

758
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,810
the mid laner of ZGDX is really arrogant,

759
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,220
like a shrew.

760
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,150
Mrs. Wang,

761
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,490
I am also responsible for this.

762
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,260
She and Tong Yao actually...

763
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,060
Of course, you're responsible.

764
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,500
Two months' salary and bonuses.

765
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,750
Don't try to bargain with me.

766
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,990
Having a mother like her is really scary.

767
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,850
As for Tong Yao...

768
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,400
How about this?

769
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,190
Why are you here?

770
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,400
Cheng, Mrs. Wang is inside.

771
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,580
It's not convenient to go in now.

772
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,280
Cheng!

773
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,360
-Cheng.
-You're finally here.

774
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,190
Why are you here instead of going with Dad

775
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,050
to the ribbon-cutting ceremony?

776
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,670
Why are you being so rude?

777
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,710
You can't even call me Mom?

778
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,250
Such a big incident has happened.

779
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,450
Of course, I had to come and deal with it.

780
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,830
This matter is simple.

781
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,540
I've already figured out how to deal with it.

782
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,910
It's true that Tong Yao made the first move,

783
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,910
so no matter what,

784
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,780
the club has to make a statement

785
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,810
and issue an apology,

786
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,870
pinning it at the top to show sincerity.

787
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,930
But the details of what happened

788
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,840
shouldn't be casually speculated by people.

789
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,520
So,

790
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,550
Rui,

791
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,140
go and find some platforms and media

792
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,940
we usually cooperate with

793
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,980
to help clarify things indirectly.

794
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,910
Yes, yes. I think Cheng was absolutely right.

795
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,070
In addition to the media,

796
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,930
I'll also ask some brother teams,

797
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,540
like CK and YQCB,

798
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,470
to show their support for us

799
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,000
during the live broadcast.

800
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,110
And then?

801
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,020
And... and then?

802
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,870
What else do you want?

803
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,750
The apology statement shouldn't just be an apology, right?

804
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,020
The club definitely needs to give an explanation

805
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,870
for her hitting someone.

806
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,450
Otherwise, it would seem insincere.

807
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,590
So, Mrs. Wang,

808
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,710
how do you plan to punish her?

809
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,570
Tong Yao will be suspended.

810
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Suspended?

811
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,150
It's...

812
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,420
You don't want this to escalate

813
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,540
to the competition control department, right?

814
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,510
One-match suspension.

815
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,150
Okay.

816
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,100
But... but...

817
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,760
Rui, take Tong Yao out first.

818
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,280
I need to have a few words with my mom.

819
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,450
Alright, Mrs. Wang, we'll go out first.

820
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,090
Let's go.

821
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,390
Sit.
