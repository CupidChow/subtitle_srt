1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,510
What's all the fuss about?

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,050
Be careful not to wet yourself.

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,660
My... pants are dirty.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,780
You wetted yourself?

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,970
Then stay away from me.

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,270
No!

7
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,320
I'm having my period.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,690
Since you're sick,

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,020
I specially requested to take care of you.

10
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,040
I do have a fever,

11
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,010
but my brain's still working fine.

12
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,270
The water's too hot. Pour me another cup.

13
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,520
Don't be difficult.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,070
Take another sip.

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,400
Sick people should drink hot water as much as possible.

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,670
Get some sleep.

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,070
I'll wake you up when the porridge is ready.

[Episode 12]

20
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,110
I...

21
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,730
Cheng, are you in your room?

22
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,280
What's the matter?

23
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,380
Nothing.

24
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,420
I thought you'd sleep a bit longer.

25
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,110
Keep it down. She's still sleeping.

26
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,710
Her own bed is dirty.

27
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,860
So she came to sleep in my room.

28
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,990
What's the big deal?

29
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,270
Cheng,

30
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,329
in this house,

31
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:38,040
besides your bed and her bed,

32
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,020
there are still a few empty beds.

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,780
She was worried she'd get the beds in other rooms dirty too.

34
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,980
Cheng, listen,

35
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,670
although it's currently the year 2020,

36
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,560
you're a man and a woman after all.

37
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,460
R-Right?

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,150
Cheng, you're impressive.

39
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,270
Usually, you're quiet.

40
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,890
But when you do something, it's always something big.

41
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,020
This time, you even managed to trick a girl into your bed.

42
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,670
Impressive.

43
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,410
She's already graduated from college.

44
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,340
She's old enough to get married.

45
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,150
That's the point?

46
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,830
That's not the point.

47
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,430
That's indeed not the point.

48
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,030
Then what is the point?

49
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,470
It's not illegal since she's an adult?

50
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,470
Cheng, this could be considered workplace harassment.

51
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,990
If you do this,

52
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,910
how am I supposed to explain it to her family?

53
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,810
I can't let it happen.

54
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,140
You go wake her up first.

55
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,220
How?

56
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,980
It's not appropriate!

57
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,190
This is so unlike you, Cheng.

58
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,060
Cheng, speak properly.

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,320
Otherwise, I'll have to call the police.

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,590
You all go downstairs first.

61
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,850
I'll wake her up later.

62
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,280
Are you satisfied now?

63
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,110
Yes.

64
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,540
Very satisfied.

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,850
If you're satisfied, leave.

66
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,710
Let's go then.

67
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,159
-Let's go then.
-I'm not leaving.

68
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,890
You go first.

69
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,220
Let's go, or it'll be so awkward.

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,430
Let's go.

71
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,380
I'm leaving.

72
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,159
-Let's go.
-We're really leaving?

73
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,480
Really, let's go.

74
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,080
Let's go.

75
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,770
-Let's go. Hurry.
-Let's go.

76
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,330
Isn't this... my room?

77
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,700
Get up.

78
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,410
Get up.

79
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,510
S-Sorry, Cheng.

Last night, I...

81
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,350
was too sleepy and cold.

82
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,490
So I... I went into...

83
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,580
If this were ancient times,

84
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,670
would it be enough to get you drowned in a pig cage?

85
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,200
May-Maybe.

86
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,730
Or should I marry you for the 801st time?

87
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,430
You're such a troublemaker.

88
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,500
You're not here to trick me into paying a bride price, are you?

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,420
Bride price?

90
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,030
What bride price?

91
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,850
Are you proposing to me?

92
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm asking if you're...

93
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,290
Never mind. I'm just mocking you.

94
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,170
What do you mean by tricking you into paying a bride price?

95
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,510
I make 800,000 yuan a year.

96
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,970
Do you think I care about your bride price?

97
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,370
So a young girl's sense of shame does exist.

98
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,550
What are you looking for?

99
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,610
Checking if you've dirtied my quilt.

100
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,980
What are you doing?

101
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,590
Stop looking.

102
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,409
If it's dirty, I'll wash it.

103
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,230
Can't you be more reliable when you do things?

104
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,230
Do you know how many times I've taken the blame for you?

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,460
You're right. Long live the captain.

106
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,810
I'll be at your service in the next life, okay?

107
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,100
No, I need to check.

108
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,320
No, give it to me!

109
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,460
Stop looking.

110
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,700
-No.
-Give it to me.

111
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,030
-Give it to me.
-No.

112
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,470
-Give it to me.
-No.

113
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,960
Give it to me.

114
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,810
Give it to me.

115
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,440
Cheng, do you want some shrimp dumplings?

116
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,890
Cheng is not in the room.

117
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,900
Yes.

118
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,630
Cheng went out.

119
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,100
Cheng.

120
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,940
Cheng?

121
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,670
You...

122
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,110
Stop nagging.

123
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,630
It's not dirty.

124
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,180
If it's dirty, I'll wash it.

125
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,870
Who was that just now?

126
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,790
Pang.

127
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,510
Why did he come back?

128
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,050
Shrimp dumplings?

129
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,980
I want to eat shrimp dumplings too.

130
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,830
Do you want to change your clothes?

131
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,830
You just sweated.

132
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,970
Don't catch a cold.

133
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,590
S-Sorry, Cheng.

135
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,270
was too sleepy and cold.

136
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,650
So I... I went into...

137

You're not here to trick me into paying a bride price, are you?

140
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Handsome.

141
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,330
Thank you all for the gifts. Thank you.

142

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,070
I want to see Cheng buy equipment.

146
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,470
Friend, thank you for giving so many gifts.

147
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,980
Guys, watch my livestreaming show.

148
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,670
Calm down.

149
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm waiting.

150
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,270
Wait.

151
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,630
Wait for me.

152
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,560
If you catch me again, I'll hit you.

153
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,540
Still won't give up?

154
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,490
Trying to catch me?

155
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,370
-Wait for me.
-I can't go back.

156
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,330
Dream on.

157
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,930
I'm going to bait them.

158
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,950
Come on!

159
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,350
Why is everyone presenting a livestreaming show?

160
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,350
So diligent.

161
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,040
Instead of asking me,

162
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,180
you should calculate your own livestreaming hours.

163
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,100
The clock is ticking.

164
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,760
We only need to livestream for 45 hours a month.

165
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,210
I think I've completed most of it.

166
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,800
What date was it when the contract was signed?

167
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,730
And Rui said

168
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,740
I could get a discount this month.

169
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,090
I livestreamed three times this week. It's five hours.

170
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,490
Plus last week's hours...

171
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,630
25... 30...

172
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,540
Oh my God.

173
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,250
I still need to livestream for 32 hours!

174
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,710
Now you've calculated it properly?

175
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,910
Welcome to hell.

176
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,790
Smiling from ZGDX specially followed by you

177
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,090
is presenting a livestreaming show.

178
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,510
Open the app and take a look.

179
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,270
Hello, everyone, I'm Smiling.

180
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,010
I'm starting my livestreaming show now.

181
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,540
It's almost the end of the month.

182
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,890
So today, I'm here to make up for lost time.

183
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,500
That's right.

184
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,990
I won't sleep until I livestream for at least eight hours.

185
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,280
Cutie, thank you for your like.

186
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,070
It's been so many days since I livestreamed last time.

187
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,350
Did you all miss me?

188
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,630
I didn't livestream during the past few days,

189
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,490
but we receive training every day.

190
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,030
Captain.

191
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,070
Is she pretty?

192
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,680
-Of course.
-Yes, the training here is very intense.

193
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,650
Of course.

194
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,990
Even though she's pretty, she's your ex-girlfriend.

195
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,190
Go on. I'm leaving.

196
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,020
What if the livestreaming hours aren't enough?

197
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,360
They'll deduct my salary.

198
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,690
But a poor person like me

199
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,870
won't give the team manager the opportunity.

200
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,830
So probably for a long time,

201
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,130
you'll see me in the livestreaming studio

202
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,170
quite often.

203
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,930
Alright, let's start ranked matches and get some points.

204
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,310
I'll ban first?

205
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,740
What should I ban? Let me think.

206
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,810
Tai's smurf account is on the enemy team.

207
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,040
Why did you ban Umibozu hardly used

208
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,750
by anyone?

209
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,450
I mistouched it. I banned the wrong one.

210
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,020
Is this the strength of your mental fortitude?

211
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,630
They picked Aoandon, but you picked Enma.

212
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,490
Are you stupid?

213
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,380
Pick Kiyohime.

214
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,930
Since I mentioned Tai,

215
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,370
there have been seven minion waves and 28 minions.

216
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,430
You missed 15 of them.

217
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,240
If I were your teammate, I'd go AFK.

218
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,040
Stop talking.

219
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,800
My minions...

220
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,960
Now it's 16.

221
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,450
One more minion and you'll reach level 6.

222
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,360
The jungler is on the way.

223
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,620
Why are you panicking?

224
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,650
That's the hand speed of someone who's been single for 20 years.

225
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,430
Why do you always run away as soon as you're pressured?

226
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,350
Why do you pay no attention

227
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,210
to your teammates' positions and only focus on your own experience bar?

228
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,860
It's the level of an amateur player.

229
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,060
What on earth did Tai do to you?

230
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,390
Did he kill someone or what?

231
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,830
Why are you so afraid of him?

232
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,830
Stop nagging. I'm about to carry the game.

233
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,070
How dare you talk to Cheng like that?

234
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,030
My darling is the best.

235
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,990
Awesome!

236
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,450
Look at you, so pathetic.

237
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,000
Open your eyes and look at the enemy team.

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,030
Where's Tai?

239
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,200
Lu Sicheng, what's wrong with you? Why did you scare me?

240
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,060
I miss how you trembled in bed,

241
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,630
not daring to say a word.

242
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,490
Cheers.

243
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,550
What are you guys talking about?

244
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,230
No.

245
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I didn't.

246
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,620
How is that possible?

247
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,350
How can you believe such words?

248
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,310
If you keep sending question marks, I'll end the show.

249
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,930
You've defiled Cheng.

250
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,460
The one with the ID of Lu Sicheng's Wife,

251
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,010
I promise he's still your darling.

252
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,150
I didn't defile him at all.

253
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,570
But I don't know if he

254
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,590
is pure or not.

255
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,530
Anyway, I didn't defile him.

256
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,120
If you have the guts, go ask him yourself.

257
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,050
How did you defile him?

258
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,290
My legs aren't even as long as his arms.

259
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,550
How could I possibly force myself on him?

260
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,830
I can't believe you.

261
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,430
You really should get rid of

262
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,030
those dirty thoughts first.

263
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,900
-Morning.
-Good morning.

264
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,080
Boring. Let's start training!

265
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,180
What's wrong with him again?

266
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,610
Our team's jungler

267
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,070
is hopelessly obsessed with the mid laner from the enemy team.

268
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,210
If he likes her so much, why did they break up?

269
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,980
Now she's a member of Team ZGDX.

270
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,510
Sitting right next to Lu Sicheng

271
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,350
is just like a lamb walking into a tiger's den.

272
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,950
If I were a woman,

273
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,630
I'd like Lu Sicheng too.

274
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,990
If you were a woman, who wouldn't you like?

275
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,550
You.

276
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,370
I'd find you distasteful.

277
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,670
You can't say that.

278
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,750
It wasn't God Yang's fault that we got thrashed

279
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,510
by Team ZGDX last time.

280
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,930
His performance was actually quite good.

281
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,090
At least he could go toe-to-toe with K.

282
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,100
The bottom laners don't get along.

283
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,660
The jungler is obsessed with another team's mid laner.

284
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,390
Our team is doomed.

285
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,820
Can we start training now?

286
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,790
Yes. Let's start training.

287
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,720
Then hurry up and come downstairs!

288
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,400
Okay.

289
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,170
Yesterday, I had a cold and she got her period.

290
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,620
We came back right after the match and didn't attend the event.

291
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,500
Then she lay on my bed in agony.

292
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,570
How could I ignore her?

293
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,560
If she died, we'd lose our mid laner.

294
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,290
We still have a match tomorrow.

295
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,350
Lu Yue?

296
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,810
Lu Yue isn't as good as her.

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,109
What the hell?

298
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,400
So, Cheng, do you actually have a girlfriend or not?

299
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,660
You're not young anymore, and all you do is playing games with a cold face.

300
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,750
You look like you don't like humans at all.

301
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,410
Aren't your family members worried?

302
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,420
Is this Little Zongzi Mao your friend?

303
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,349
How did you know?

304
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,190
She said I don't like humans. That sounds familiar.

305
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,290
Your face does look like

306
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,170
you don't like humans.

307
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,960
Stop spreading rumors.

308
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,359
Who should be responsible if I can't find a wife in the future?

309
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,830
It's so noisy. Stop babbling.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,950
Big news!

311
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,860
It has been confirmed that Team ZGDX's two core players shared a bed!

312
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,090
Cheng even talked about that during his livestreaming show?

313
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,310
Clearly, nothing happened between them. He was just bluffing.

314
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,030
Why did I fall in love with

315
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,430
an esports player who doesn't like humans?

316
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,900
What are you doing?

317
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,990
I'm looking for someone.

318
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,000
Looking for someone?

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,100
Who are you looking for?

320
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,500
Make a call and ask that person to come here to take you inside.

321
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,250
I didn't bring my phone.

322
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,120
Could I borrow your phone?

323
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,770
Thank you.

324
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:47,820
Hello?

325
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,220
Hello, who is this?

326
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,990
Hello?

327
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,410
That's strange.

328
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,170
Why isn't this person saying anything?

329
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,250
Then just hang up.

330
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,910
Can't you see the minion waves are pushing into the turret?

331
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,710
Lu Sicheng, shut your mouth!

332
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,740
My minions!

333
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,890
Hello, Yao, it's me.

334
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,520
Hello.

335
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,120
I'm at the entrance of your training base.

336
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Can you come out?

337
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,380
What? At the entrance of my training base?

338
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,310
The security guard won't let me in.

339
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,160
Why did you suddenly come here?

340
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,960
Wait a moment.

341
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,590
Lu Yue, come here and finish this for me.

342
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,920
I need to go out for a bit.

343
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,910
Okay.

344
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,020
Who is it?

345
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,720
Jian Yang.

346
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,210
What's he doing here?

347
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,360
How would I know?

348
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,280
Cheng, I think it's because of what you said.

349
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,390
With all due respect,

350
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,230
you guys just don't know what the key point is.

351
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,050
In the future, if Team CK's jungler

352
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,980
and Team ZGDX's mid laner

353
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,650
interact during a match, the game will be over.

354
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,180
Not bad. The live chat is pretty spicy.

355
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,830
Shut up.

356
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,830
Thank you.

357
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,720
No big deal.

358
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,660
Your girlfriend is on her way here, right?

359
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,540
It's dark.

360
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,490
You can go in first.

361
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,950
Don't let her walk too far.

362
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,700
Thank you.

363
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,190
Babe,

364
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,790
I didn't know about it at all.

365
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,420
Tong Yao hasn't shown up. I...

366
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,020
Tong Yao!

367
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,770
Come here.

368
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,530
Ai Jia?

369
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,230
What are you doing here?

370
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,470
Waiting for you.

371
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,510
Let me just remind you,

372
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,610
as the saying goes,

373
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,220
a good horse doesn't go back to graze on what it has rejected.

374
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,510
You shouldn't mess with your ex-boyfriend.

375
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,110
Someone once said

376
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,360
she'll never date an esports player.

377
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,030
Alright, I got it.

378
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,510
I won't get back together with him.

379
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,540
Why should I?

380
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,710
But he got drunk and came here.

381
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,510
I should at least send him back, right?

382
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,590
Otherwise, people might say

383
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,690
Team CK's jungler died on the way to Team ZGDX's training base.

384
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,750
That would be really bad if it got out.

385
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,130
Fine.

386
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,360
How about asking Ai Jia to go with you?

387
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,060
What does this have to do with me?

388
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,860
I'm not going.

389
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,350
What good are you?

390
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,610
Tong Yao.

391
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:22,820
Honey,

392
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,830
I'll livestream it for you later.

393
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,780
It'll be really interesting.

394
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,790
What are you doing here?

395
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,880
Jian Yang, what are you doing?

396
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,910
Damn it!

397
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,510
Let go of me.

398
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,060
Keep your voice down.

399
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,660
I'll tell you after I go back.

400
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,770
You drank alcohol?

401
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,050
Are you really together with Lu Sicheng?

402
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,740
What do you mean?

403
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,950
During his livestreaming show,

404
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,280
he explained everything clearly, right?

405
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,490
You didn't come all this way

406
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,180
across half of Shenzhen just for this, did you?

407
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,950
If you're here to gossip,

408
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,510
you can order a DiDi ride and leave now.

409
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,230
Goodbye.

410
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,470
Then why did he say those ambiguous things

411
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,580
to stir up rumors in the livestreaming show?

412
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,900
Now the whole special discussion group is talking about you two,

413
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,560
saying that you're together.

414
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,470
Every time I see these things,

415
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,350
I feel like I'm going crazy.

416
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,030
That was just teammates joking around.

417
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,690
Besides, what does it have to do with you anyway?

418
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,840
Jian Yang,

419
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,590
I think

420
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,430
I've already made myself very clear.

421
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,760
What did you make clear?

422
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,470
That we are over.

423
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,940
Really.

424
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,140
Wasn't everything fine before?

425
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,370
You focused on your career.

426
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,550
I focused on my studies.

427
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,410
We stayed out of each other's way.

428
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,150
Why are you so worked up now that I've become a professional esports player?

429
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,430
I'm not worked up.

430
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,280
At least you should give me a chance to explain.

431
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,820
I lied to you. It was my fault.

432
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,220
I was worried you'd think too much.

433
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,610
That's why I didn't dare to tell you.

434
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,210
I really didn't do anything.

435
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,150
After I got drunk, I went back directly.

436
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,770
If you don't believe me,

437
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,260
you can ask Luck and the others.

438
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,110
Why should I ask them?

439
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,430
Besides,

440
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,280
usually, men tend to lose control after drinking, right?

441
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,240
Isn't that just in TV dramas?

442
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Drunk men don't have the strength to do anything else.

443
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,070
A report from an anonymous stranger.

444
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,000
Your team's mid laner is involved in an inappropriate relationship.

445
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,360
Captain, please take action to stop her.

446
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,430
OPL

447
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,830
is the land of dreams. You must not tolerate such misconduct.

448
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,970
They're hugging. Oh my God!

449
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
It's truly heartbreaking.

450
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,340
Cheng, where are you going?

451
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,430
I'm going to buy some candies.

452
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,970
With a family history of genetic conditions, you still want to eat candies?

453
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,970
I'm just going to buy them to look at.

454
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,700
Yao.

455
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,480
Stop.

456
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,440
Tong Yao. My name is Tong Yao.

457
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,910
Tong Yao.

458
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,770
Give me one more chance.

459
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,530
Okay?

460
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,340
I really didn't mean to hurt you.

461
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,780
You didn't understand because you weren't a professional player.

462
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,560
Now you're in this industry too.

463
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,140
You should know how difficult it is.

464
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,990
Our lives are exposed

465
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,050
under the scrutiny of fans and media.

466
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,700
Trying to protect the one you love

467
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,640
is really hard.

468
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,030
I didn't want

469
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,690
to expose you to my fans before

470
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,190
because I was worried they would hurt you.

471
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,710
Yao, I miss you.

472
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
I miss you so much.

473
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,020
I've always dreamed that one day,

474
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,720
we'd go to the finals together.

475
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,190
You'd be in the crowd, watching me.

476
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,710
When I lift that trophy,

477
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,140
I would propose to you.

478
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,650
Jian Yang, don't you understand?

479
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,280
Now I can personally play...

480
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,940
Cheng.

481
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,970
I came out to buy candies, but I didn't bring any money.

482
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,800
Give me some money. I'll pay back the money after I go back.

483
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,840
Don't people use Alipay nowadays?

484
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,160
Okay. Here.

485
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,870
Oh, right.

486
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,990
I don't have a problem with you two being lovey-dovey,

487
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,630
but I think

488
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,660
it's necessary to state the facts objectively.

489
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,300
First,

490
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,930
indeed, Shorty will go to the finals.

491
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,490
But

492
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,350
she'll play in the finals herself.

493
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,770
She probably won't have time to sit in the audience

494
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,840
watching your team play.

495
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,350
Second,

496
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,280
the trophy this year

497
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,190
already has ZGDX engraved on it.

498
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,860
I'll pick Youko. Thanks.

499
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,760
That's all I have to say. You two can continue.

500
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,320
You came all the way here.

501
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,210
What exactly do you want to say?

502
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,790
If I hadn't become

503
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,330
a professional player from the beginning,

504
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,480
we would have been together forever, right?

505
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,810
Jian Yang, don't you understand?

506
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,840
We didn't break up

507
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,280
because you became a professional player.

508
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,670
It was because of me.

509
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,080
From the very beginning,

510
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,560
you never saw me as someone

511
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
who could walk side by side with you,

512
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,410
or as an equal.

513
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,310
You have your dreams,

514
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,700
and I have my goals.

515
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,750
We simply can't be in sync.

516
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,650
So, Jian Yang,

517
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,840
we're not meant for each other.

518
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,510
How come we're not meant for each other?

519
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,910
Yao, we were fine before, right?

520
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,510
Jian Yang,

521
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,410
let's leave it at that for today.

522
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,200
You're drunk.

523
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,990
Let me take you back to the training base.

524
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,740
It's not good for your fans to see you like this.

525
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,470
Let's go.

526
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,810
So what are we now?

527
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,110
Friends.

528
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,750
If we're still friends,

529
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,720
remove me first.

530
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,590
What?

531
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,070
From the blacklist.

532
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,190
Done.

533
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,870
But if you say

534
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,190
strange things again in the future,

535
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,710
I'll blacklist you again.

536
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,930
What strange things?

537
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,720
Like getting back together

538
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,410
or watching you shine.

539
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,880
Okay.

540
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,310
Since we're friends,

541
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,050
how about a hug?

542
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,160
Alright.

543
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,730
We hugged each other.

544
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,110
I removed you from the blacklist.

545
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,710
Let's go. I'll send you back.

546
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
The car is here. Go back.

547
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,810
I'm leaving then.

548
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,110
Hello.

549
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,030
Hello.

550
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,710
We just moved in. We live across from your house.

551
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,790
Hello.

552
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,950
Sorry.

553
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,130
The decoration lasted for two months. It must have disturbed you.

554
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,890
It's okay. We understand.

555
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,020
What's your son's name?

556
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,180
Yang.

557
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,840
Yao, thank him.

558
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,370
Thank you.

559
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,290
I won't go back to school.

560
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,510
I'll stay there to be a professional player.

561
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,790
Listen to the songs in my exclusive healing playlist.

562
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,850
Have a sweet dream.

563
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,850
Tomorrow will be a new beginning.

564
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,260
Cheng.

565
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,770
Have you two gotten back together?

566
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,489
No.

567
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,840
Then why did he hug you?

568
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,670
How did you see that?

569
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,219
It's none of your business.

570
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,250
That was a hug between friends.

571
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,380
Do you think I'm a three-year-old boy?

572
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,639
Captain,

573
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,980
why did you come here?

574
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,230
Didn't I tell you?

575
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,560
I went to buy candies.

576
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,480
Why do I think you're here to cause trouble?

577
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,929
Cause trouble?

578
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,440
What makes you say that?

579
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,190
A girl's sixth sense.

580
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,880
Someone as dense as an elephant like you

581
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,000
has a sixth sense?

582
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,040
Take out your wallet and let's have a look.

583
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,590
What's there to look at?

584
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,870
Who gave you the courage?

585
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,060
Liang Jingru.

586
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,760
Childish.

587
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,220
Why did you two come back together?

588
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,750
Shorty, where's your God Yang?

589
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,200
Have you gotten back together?

590
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,600
Or did you refuse God Yang

591
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,020
to be with Cheng?

592
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,050
We just happened to run into each other, okay?

593
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,050
Jian Yang left.

594
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,920
We didn't get back together.

595
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,320
And being with Cheng?

596
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,510
I want to live a longer life.

597
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,090
So I absolutely won't date an esports player.

598
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,120
Can't you be a little gentler?

599
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,830
No!

600
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,610
Your performance is something else.

601
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,120
Wait.

602
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,600
Lu Yue!

603
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,740
You bastard.

604
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,040
Don't ruin my account!

605
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,030
You asked me to play for you.

606
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,610
I didn't ask you to play like this.

607
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,350
How can I turn the tide now?

608
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,190
I played very well.

609
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,500
I'm about to carry the game, okay?

610
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,350
Impossible.

611
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,610
You're so noisy.

612
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,600
Why aren't you eating the candies you bought?

613
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,460
I suddenly don't want to eat them.

614
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,760
He didn't go out to buy candies in the first place.

615
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,400
Look.

616
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,100
There are still a lot of candies in it.

617
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,420
See?

618
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,330
What?

619
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,430
I've been at the training base for too long.

620
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,740
Can't I go out for a walk?

621
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,400
Breathing fresh air helps alleviate symptoms.

622
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,190
I believe you.

623
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,520
Our team's goal this year is the championship.

624
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,320
No early romance. No fraternizing with the enemy.

625
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,720
Alright then.

626
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,190
Don't tell me

627
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,060
the sequel to The Legend of the White Snake in esports is Fairy Couple.

628
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,520
I can't believe I saw Jian Yang gank Team ZGDX's training base.

629
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,500
Esports Farm

630
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,140
truly is a breeding ground for esports gossip.

631
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,680
[Jinyang]

632
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,710
Hello.

633
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,520
How are things between you and Jian Yang?

634
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,780
What else can there be?

635
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,880
I just removed him from the blacklist.

636
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,280
Then I asked him to leave.

637
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,340
At least you have a conscience.

638
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,060
Wait.

639
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,930
Cheng came today.

640
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,700
If I'm not wrong,

641
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,390
it was you who tipped him off, right?

642
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,990
We truly are good friends. Your guess is right.

643
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,700
By tipping him off today,

644
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,160
I noticed Cheng's special feelings for you.

645
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,190
That's not true.

646
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,470
Then explain to me.

647
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,350
What's really going on between you and Cheng?

648
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,270
And what's

649
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,980
with the bed thing?

650
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,540
Even if it was a joke, it's too...

651
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,430
You know what?

652
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,470
Weibo and the special discussion group

653
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,430
are buzzing about you two.

654
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,160
And now he's acting like this.

655
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,680
I told you

656
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,580
he occasionally says flirty things.

657
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,820
He stopped you from getting back together with Jian Yang today.

658
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,530
How do you explain that?

659
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,710
He probably really doesn't want me

660
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,350
to be distracted by things like a relationship.

661
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,910
Come to think of it, in our team,

662
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,710
it seems no one has a girlfriend.

663
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,420
I can feel your hypocrisy even from here.

664
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,230
Do you really think Lu Sicheng did that

665
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,940
just for the team's performance?

666
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,950
Enough. Let's not talk about this.

667
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,530
Don't try to brainwash me.

668
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,620
Every boy in our team

669
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,170
has a bunch of female fans,

670
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,480
especially Cheng.

671
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,920
He has countless female fans.

672
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,570
Plus, he's handsome and from a rich family.

673
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,940
If he likes me,

674
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,130
it would probably be because I cast a spell on him.

675
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,840
You really are a good girl.

676
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,350
Why are you so insecure?

677
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,070
You're comforting me so seriously.

678
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,830
Why do I feel it makes me

679
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,500
want to blacklist you even more?

680
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,580
I'm tall, beautiful, and charming.

681
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,860
I can't believe you want to blacklist me.

682
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,310
That doesn't change the fact that Mao's dad is an idiot.

683
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,110
You're right.

684
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,230
I'll just consider it

685
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,230
doing good deeds and building up good karma in this life.

686
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,090
In my next life,

687
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,470
if my husband

688
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,690
could be more handsome than young Leonardo DiCaprio,

689
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,060
it would be thanks to the good fortune I've earned in this life.

690
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,270
Alright, I gotta go.

691
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,220
I'm a bit sleepy.

692
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,630
Okay, good night.

693
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,290
Good night.

694
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,620
Do you really think Lu Sicheng did that

695
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,480
just for the team's performance?

696
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,740
Even an idiot can tell

697
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,160
Lu Sicheng likes Tong Yao.

698
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,850
Is there really someone who can't see it?

699
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,250
No way.

700
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,110
Tong Yao doesn't deserve Lu Sicheng.

701
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,110
What are you talking about?
