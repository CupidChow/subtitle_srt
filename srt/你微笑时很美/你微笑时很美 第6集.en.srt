8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,900
Cheng,

9
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,230
you think Tai will come

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,160
and target Tong Yao during our practice match?

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,300
He will use Tamamonomae to defeat Tong Yao.

12
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,560
This is his specialty.

13
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,780
But Tong Yao is the No. 1 Tamamonomae player in China.

She may not lose.

Running away may be shameful, but it works.

I want to be that beautiful girl who brings justice.

17

Even if he uses Tamamonomae,

I can still win.

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
You've been practicing using Tamamonomae all night.

28
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,620
Didn't you say you were fine?

29

You little liar.

36
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,590
I happened to watch

37
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,600
the recording of the practice match between Team ZGDX and Team TAT.

38
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,330
As we all know,

39
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,170
it wasn't meant to be accessible to viewers.

40
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,800
It must have been intentionally leaked this time.

41
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,390
Long story short, ZGDX got completely destroyed.

42
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,820
Their opponent, Tai, crushed Smiling with Tamamonomae.

43
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,780
Smiling directly became the weak link.

44
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,770
You could see her teammates trying hard to turn the tide,

45
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,750
but Smiling

46
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,480
was just too weak, dragging everyone down.

47
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,370
Look at what you've been hyping up these past few daysâ€”

What a joke.

50
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,310
Someone casually used the same shikigami

51
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,850
and completely crushed her into the ground.

52
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,930
So weak.

53
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,740
Praising when she won, trashing when she lost.

54
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,800
You really have a way of doing things.

55
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,240
What can one practice match prove?

56
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,590
And how coincidental

57

58
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,910
was the one they lost.

59
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,570
Team TAT's intentions are truly despicable.

60
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,770
Why does hardly anyone like this team

61
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,320
despite winning so many championships?

62
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,050
It's time for some serious reflection, isn't it?

Pope and Cheng Ge leaving TAT one after the other

64

I'm sure their fans are relieved too.

66
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,180
Liking a player

67
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,680
but hating the team he's on

68
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,860
is definitely a contradictory thing.

69
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,750
Weren't you the one hyping them up before?

70
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,140
They beat a bunch of weak domestic teams,

71
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,520
and you were boasting louder than anyone.

72
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,550
So ridiculous.

73
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,560
Does it hurt to be proven wrong now?

74
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,380
ZGDX signed this weak-as-hell mid laner.

75
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,590
They must be cursed.

76
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,540
Strongly demanding the return of Pro Ming's substitute mid laner, Lv.

77
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,540
Oh my God.

78
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,850
TAT is such a bastard.

79
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,730
Why did they put

80

the video of the practice match online?

81
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,350
First, they deliberately provoked us,

82
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,350
forcing the club to respond.

83
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,740
Then they intentionally targeted Tong Yao,

84
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,780
and now they've uploaded the video without permission,

85
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,690
inciting netizens to cyberbully our new mid laner.

86
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,130
This behavior is utterly despicable.

87
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,660
Despicable and shameless!

88

your mom's been a bit emotional lately.

90

You need to be good.

91
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,590
It was also my fault

92
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,000
for not standing my ground with the club,

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,460
letting others bully her.

94
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,920
She hasn't been with us long,

95
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,110
and she's already fallen victim to Tai's nasty attack.

96
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,920
She wouldn't be discouraged from now on

97
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,720
and afraid to play again, right?

98
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,020
She hasn't shut herself off from the world, has she?

99
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,390
She's been locked in her room all day.

100
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,050
If she's really that fragile,

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,159
she's not cut out for professional gaming.

102
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,620
She's a rookie, after all.

103
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,620
I think it's the first time

104
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,250
in her life that she has encountered something like this.

105
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,370
As her teammates,

106
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,950
we should be more understanding of her from now on.

107
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,350
Right.

108
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,409

110
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,159

111
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,250
and care for her.

112
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,130
Did you hear that, K?

113
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,400
Protect and care.

114
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,050
Is she some kind of giant panda,

115
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,550
a national third-class protected animal?

116
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,480
We have to protect and care for her?

117
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,920
Esports has nothing to do with gender.

118
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,750
Wait,

119
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,870
third-class?

120
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Aren't giant pandas first-class protected animals?

121
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,690
Look.

122
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,070
I told you,

123
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,250
signing a female player was definitely just for publicity.

124
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,190
If they wanted to win, they should've fought for Pope.

125
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,510
They won't even let Lv come back, all for attention.

126
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,570
Want to hear a joke?

and you can't help but jump out.

135
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,420
You've been holding it in for a long time, haven't you?

136
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,280
You must be bursting at the seams.

137
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,250
Do you get off on attacking others?

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you get off on slandering people?

139
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,000
The championship is still TAT's?

140
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,470
If China wins the championship,

141
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,600
shouldn't you guys livestream yourselves going to the bathroom,

142
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,640
eating something,

143
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,500
and then chopping something off?

144
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,610
She's still sleeping upstairs?

145
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,090
Yeah,

146
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,910
we haven't seen her all day.

147
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,990
This can't go on.

148
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,310
Isn't it just a practice match?

149
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,370
I'll go talk to her.

150
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,790
Rui, I'm going out for a bit.

151
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,400
Jinyang is looking for me.

152
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,040
Um, will you come back?

153
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,670
Don't stay out too late.

154
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,520
Be careful, you're a girl!

155
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,520
It's good for her to go out at this time.

156
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,180
It'll keep her from seeing those things online.

157
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,950
You saw it too, right?

158
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,800
Someone actually leaked the practice match video,

159
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
posting that kind of thing online.

160
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,520
Who would dare to schedule practice matches with them after this?

161
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,310
That's why they can't get any practice matches.

162
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,210
Usually, it's just their first and second teams playing against each other.

163
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,340
A bunch of bastards.

164
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,380
But Tong Yao should be okay now, right?

165
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,800
She seems fine on the surface,

166
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,530
but she must be hurting inside.

167
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,160
She's been here for so long,

168
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,860
but she never pulled an all-nighter to practice.

169
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,590
That's true.

170
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,380
Looking at her dark circles,

171
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,830
I wonder what time she went to bed last night.

172
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,960
5:30 in the morning.

173
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,680
You've lost some points.

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,410
I just played a round casually.

175
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,180
Don't come back too late.

176
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,470
Welcome.

177
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,480
We have a reservation.

178
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,040
Okay.

179
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Come on, this way.

180
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,570
Don't be so gloomy.

181
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,630
Cheer up.

182
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,270
Have a seat.

183
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,210
Please check the menu and see what you'd like to order.

184
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,810
Thank you.

185
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,000
Look. What do you want to drink?

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
I don't drink alcohol. I can't handle it.

187
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,910
I'm not asking you to drink alcohol.

188
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,910
I brought you here to help you relax.

189
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,630
Pick one.

190
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,030
Here.

191
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,790
Alright.

192
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,310
Long Island Iced Tea.

193
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,370
I'll have this one.

194
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,100
Two Long Island Iced Teas, please.

195
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,630
Okay, please wait a moment.

196
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,860
Long Island Iced Tea will make you strong.

197
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,860
Strong?

198
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,360
You just lost a practice match.

199
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,800
When Ai Jia first started playing in professional leagues,

200
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,310
because he was too young and inexperienced,

201
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,220
it was common for him to get his mindset wrecked by losses.

202
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,290
He was even afraid of being seen by me,

203
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,610
and he would sneak out to the balcony to cry.

204
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,210
He was such a little crybaby.

205
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,400
But after crying,

206
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,200
he would be back at it the following day,

207
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,080
eagerly preparing for the next match.

208
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,680
I couldn't hold it in either.

209
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,860
I cried all morning.

210
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,040
Just a moment ago, you said you weren't fragile.

211
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,960
Alright.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,530
It's not shameful for a young girl to cry a bit.

213
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,630
I was crying like hell, and someone saw me.

214
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,990
What are you mumbling about?

215
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,140
Drink slowly.

216
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,740
Why are you drinking so fast?

217
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,510
Girl, you're quite bold.

218
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,830
Come on, have a drink with me.

219
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,910
Have a drink with me, come on.

220
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,590
Who are you?

221
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,790
Just one drink.

222
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,460
Come on.

223
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,880
What are you doing?

224
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,860
Who are you?

225
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,710
Get lost.

226
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,430
Like a persistent ghost.

227
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,430
How did he know we were here?

228
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,380
Who knows?

229
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,680
Maybe he sniffed us out like a dog.

230
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,380
After I did your makeup last time,

231
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,700
I'm in his grasp.

232
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,750
Ai Jia,

233
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,050
could you control your gaze a little?

234
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,590
Wifey.

235
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,270
Wifey.

236
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,230
Wifey.

237
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,700
Jinyang.

238
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,420
Baby.

239
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,710
You.

240
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
Go sit over there.

241
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,540
Wait until I'm done making my girl feel better.

242
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,510
Yao,

243
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,820
since it's a competition,

244
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,340
there will definitely be wins and losses.

245
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,860
You know that it's impossible to win every time.

246
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,590
It was just a practice match.

247
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,990
You still have the entire National League ahead of you.

248
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,750
Why care about what others say?

249
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,410
How about this?

250
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,390
I'll buy you some online supporters

251
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,100
to fight back.

252
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,860
That's right.

253
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,190
Who hasn't lost before?

254
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,970
Although I don't know that Tai,

255
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:00,730
don't worry.

256
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,990
If I ever meet him,

257
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,430
I'll get revenge for you.

258
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,070
Shut up.

259
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,900
You're always running your mouth.

260
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,310
Is she blind, or has she lost her hands?

261
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,000
When did it become your job to help her get revenge?

262
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,370
That's not what I meant.

263
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,940
Didn't I just tell you to go sit over there?

264
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,420
Go.

265
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,380
Babe,

266
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,770
tell me,

267
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,630
how can I make you stronger?

268
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,310
How about

269
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,340
I order you

270
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,300
a Las Vegas-style male strip show?

271
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,690
Come now, opportunity is knocking.

272
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
But anyway,

273
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,500
I still don't quite understand Tai's strategy

274
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,620
of using the shikigami you're good at to defeat you.

275
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,990
Why is it so effective

276
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,220
against you, professional players?

277
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,780
God Niu retired because of this,

278
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,170
and I didn't expect Tong Yao to face the same situation today.

279
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,160
Logically speaking,

280
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,030
wouldn't it be more frustrating

281
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,560
to be utterly defeated online

282
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,340
while using the shikigami you're best at?

283
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,140
Of course not.

284
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,740
Because being proficient with a shikigami

285
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,060
isn't just about understanding its skills

286
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,550
and applying techniques skillfully.

287
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,020
It's also about understanding the whole game.

288
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,310
So once you're defeated,

289
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,970
it can be very disheartening.

290
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,800
Still don't get it?

291
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,190
Let me put it this way.

292
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,700
You've been excellent at English since childhood,

293
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,170
outperforming everyone around you.

294
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,590
You can even chat effortlessly with foreigners.

295
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,700
Whenever there's a speech event at school,

296
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,500
you're always the one in the spotlight.

297
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,700
You're the English legend of this city.

298
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,830
Until one day,

299
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,220
you win first place in the city

300
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,020
and attend a national-level English summer camp,

301
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,819
only to find that each one of the people there

302
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,020
can match you evenly.

303
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,190
And some even

304
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,510
make you struggle desperately to understand

305
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,900
what they're saying.

306
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,859
While you're completely confused and at a loss,

307
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,520
they turn around and mock you,

308
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,109
saying, "With your level of skill,

309
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,790
you actually think you belong in this summer camp?"

310
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,849
How would you feel?

311
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,260
Let me put it another way.

312
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,940
If you're at a gathering where people

313
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,260
speak various foreign languages,

314
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,940
and one person speaks Japanese exceptionally well,

315
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,070
to the point where you can barely understand what they're saying,

316
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,270
what would you think?

317
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,150
You'd probably just think,

318
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,010
"This person is good at Japanese,

319
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,060
but what does that have to do with me?"

320
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,790
"I don't speak Japanese in my daily life anyway."

321
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,000
When you put it that way...

322
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,460
So, for Tong Yao, Tamamonomae is a kind of...

323
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,900
A kind of what?

324
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,440
Never mind.

325
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,310
As a professional player,

326
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,910
she'll have to go through this sooner or later.

327
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,020
Stop reading these negative comments.

328
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,680
I brought you here to have fun.

329
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,380
Stop drinking.

330
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,710
Waiter,

331
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,310
bring me another iced tea!

332
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
Sit down quickly.

333
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,760
What "iced tea"?

334
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,490
That's "Long Island Iced Tea."

335
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:41,980
Jian Yang!

336
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,300
Why is he here?

337
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,230
You tipped him off, you little rat.

338
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,560
Do you have a death wish?

339
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,420
Come here.

340
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,620
Well...

341
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,220
Come here.

342
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,020
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

343
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,590
They're a pair, and we're a pair.

344
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Isn't that great?

345
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,990
Yao, stop drinking.

346
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,310
Go away.

347
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,900
Come on, I'll take you to wash your face.

348
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,960
Get some fresh air.

349
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,760
I'm not livestreaming.

350
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,040
I'm not competing or performing on stage.

351
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,570
Why do I need to wash my face?

352
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,720
Who are you anyway?

353
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,900
It's already 11:00 PM.

354
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,750
Why hasn't Tong Yao come back yet?

355
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,610
That silly girl didn't go jump into the sea, did she?

356
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,580
SOHO Bar, come quickly.

357
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,940
Why did you ask Lu Sicheng to come?

358
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,500
Didn't I already ask Jian Yang?

359
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,630
They might get back together tonight.

360
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,210
Get back together? Did I ever agree to that?

361
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,680
A lying, cheating man

362
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,590
doesn't deserve to be with my best friend.

363
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,740
It was all a misunderstanding.

364
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,850
Jian Yang has always had feelings for Tong Yao.

365
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,180
Don't use that "misunderstanding" excuse.

366
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,670
Besides, Tong Yao doesn't like Jian Yang anymore.

367
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,300
If she doesn't like him, why did she come to play professionally?

368
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,150
Her playing professionally has nothing to do with men.

369
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,810
Moreover,

370
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,040
if she liked him, how could they have ever broken up?

371
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,150
We like each other, but we also broke up, didn't we?

372
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,980
Couples breaking up and getting back together

373
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,660
is very normal.

374
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,590
Anyway, I'm on Jian Yang's side.

375
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,790
Jian Yang is my buddy.

376
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,500
Tong Yao is still my best friend.

377
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,910
A wise bird chooses its tree carefully before settling down.

378
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,900
After all, between us sisters,

379
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,100
one is already blind.

380
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,980
Blind?

381
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,000
Who's blind?

382
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,710
Me.

383
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,230
Are you serious?

384
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,810
Let me see.

385
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,060
Let me take a look.

386
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,700
How did you become blind?

387
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,630
Get lost.

388
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,500
Yao,

389
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,370
I know you lost the match

390
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,830
and you're feeling upset.

391
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,510
But you can't use alcohol

392
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,630
to numb yourself.

393
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,800
And you can't shut everyone out, either.

394
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,870
I've been thinking a lot lately.

395
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,440
I was indeed wrong in the past.

396
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,360
I shouldn't have lied,

397
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,600
nor should I have refused to explain because I found you annoying.

398
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,020
Now I understand.

399
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,710
Yao,

400
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,390
I really can't live without you.

401
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,470
Without you,

402
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,320
I can't even play the game well.

403
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,820
I follow all your news.

404
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,060
Whether you're doing well or not,

405
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,540
I feel sad.

406
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,830
When you're doing well, I'm sad.

407
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,680
Because I was not the one making you happy.

408
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,690
When I see you're not doing well,

409
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,380
I want to be by your side.

410
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,500
Although I should have said these words

411
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,070
when you're sober,

412
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,950
I still can't help it.

413
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,490
Give me another chance.

414
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,900
Let's get back together,

415
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,460
okay?

416
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,510
Where's my phone?

417
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,300
Where's my phone?

418
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,180
It's here.

419
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,940
Come here.

420
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,690
Let's give them some space.

421
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,190
Tong Yao is feeling upset right now.

422
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,050
In the end,

423
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,260
it's you screen junkies who are the problem.

424
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,060
Chen Jinyang,

425
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,010
you can scold me,

426
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,620
but don't call me a screen junkie.

427
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,870
Be careful, or I'll sue you for defamation.

428
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,140
How dare you talk back?

429
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,100
Staring at the computer screen all day,

430
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,460
what else would you be other than a screen junkie?

431
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,470
Programmers stare at computers all day too.

432
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,110
We're professional players,

433
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,110
athletes.

434
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,870
You think I'm joking?

435
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,670
Professional players?

436
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,070
Is there a future in that?

437
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,390
I don't like hearing that.

438
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,860
How can you say there's no future?

439
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,830
We represent our country.

440
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,910
Don't be angry.

441
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,350
Yao?

442
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,440
What are you looking at?

443
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,740
I'm looking at...

444
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,930
the posts of "I Am Your Grandfather."

445
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,630
Who would choose such a username?

446
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,690
Stop looking at it.

447
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,620
Let them say whatever they want.

448
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,550
We just need to focus on ourselves.

449
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,060
Come on, stop drinking.

450
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,120
I'll take you back.

451
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,900
Jian Yang.

452
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,480
You don't understand me at all.

453
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,900
You have no idea what I care about.

454
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,790
What I care about

455
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,040
isn't what people say online.

456
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,510
Those haters can't bring me down.

457
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,270
What I care about is

458
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,590
that Tamamonomae, for me,

459
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,940
is a kind of...

460
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,310
-Are you alright?
-Jian Yang.

461
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,510
What's wrong with you, Jian Yang?

462
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,110
How did you make her throw up?

463
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,430
She said that I don't understand what she cares about.

464
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,620
I even know that.

465
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,260
What you care about is

466
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,390
being defeated by someone else

467
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,790
using the shikigami you're good at, right?

468
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:04,910
I understand that feeling.

469
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,350
You don't understand a thing.

470
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,140
Mom, I've lost a tooth.

471
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,940
Is it an upper or lower tooth?

472
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Throw the upper tooth under the bed.

473
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,630
Captain, you're finally here.

474
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,480
Hey, girl, wake up.

475
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,170
Someone's here to pick you up.

476
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,020
Why do I feel like I'm seeing our captain?

477
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,550
He's glaring at me fiercely

478
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,860
like he's about to throw me into the sea.

479
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,810
Then I'll take a boat to fish out your body tomorrow.

480
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,190
How did she get so drunk?

481
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,430
She's in a bad mood.

482
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,870
I was afraid she'd go online when she had nothing to do

483
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,260
to read those comments.

484
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,200
However, I didn't expect her to drink so much.

485
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,280
What are you talking about?

486
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,830
I was drinking iced tea.

487
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,540
Shut up.

488
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,410
Why are you so fierce, even in my dream?

489
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,980
I'll take her back first.

490
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,440
I'll take Tong Yao back.

491
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,340
I'm her team captain.

492
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,400
It's my duty to take her back to the training base.

493
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,340
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

494
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,220
Ex? That means you're history.

495
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,460
Let's go.

496
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,970
What are you trying to do now?

497
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,180
Take Tong Yao back, of course.

498
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,870
That's Cheng's job. Why do you need to go?

499
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,620
Leave them alone together?

500
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,020
I'm not comfortable with that.

501
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,750
Jian Yang.

502
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,540
You and Tong Yao have already broken up.

503
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,560
My shoe... My shoe dropped.

504
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,310
Where is my shoe?

505
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,430
In my hand.

506
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,920
I want to wear it.

507
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,940
You're not even walking. Why do you need it?

508
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,390
Keep this up, and I'll throw you down.

509
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,540
So mean.

510
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,530
Cheng,

511
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,120
why are you so fierce wherever you go?

512
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,140
Can't you be a little kinder?

513
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,870
Carrying you on my back is already my kindest act.

514
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,660
Shorty.

515
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,510
Do you know

516
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,220
it's normal to win or lose in esports competitions?

517
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,860
I know.

518
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,830
Isn't that what you told me before?

519
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,820
Then do you know

520
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,440
that no matter how much others criticize you,

521
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,670
it won't affect your becoming

522
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,330
an excellent esports player?

523
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,510
I know that.

524
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,630
So I don't care about

525
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,360
those haters' comments at all.

526
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,750
Cheng,

527
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,310
I was not crying because of winning or losing,

528
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,630
or those comments,

529
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,310
or my own pride.

530
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,270
I was crying because I don't like the version of myself that drags you down.

531
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:36,070
I feel anxious, insecure, and both self-deprecating and arrogant.

532
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,190
Can I really become a good pro player?

533
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,910
Do I really know how to play this game?

534
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,740
Do I really know how to use Tamamonomae?

535
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,650
Jian Yang and others don't understand.

536
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,170
Actually, Tamamonomae for me...

537
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,270
Is a kind of faith.

538
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:53,940
Yes.

539
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,490
Cheng,

540
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,210
now that my faith has collapsed,

541
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,770
what should I do?

542
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,070
How about building a new faith

543
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,800
with the determination to win?

544
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,700
It's not that easy.

545
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,400
How would you know if you don't try?

546
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,660
I'll know once I try?

547
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,250
You should know

548
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,000
that Pro Ming chose you

549
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,270
from hundreds of potential players.

550
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,620
Are you doubting his judgment?

551
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,680
I can teach you too.

552
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,990
Cheng,

553
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,190
you're lying.

554
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,670
You're so strong.

555
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,010
How can you take this kind of insult?

556
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,180
You, Lu Sicheng, can't teach this kind of thing.

557
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,230
You're so proud.

558
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,420
Why aren't you saying anything?

559
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,660
Suddenly, I feel like what you're saying makes sense.

560
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,460
Sober up a bit.

561
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,860
If you go back like this,

562
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,130
Rui will definitely scold you.

563
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,080
I'll go buy you some hangover medicine.

564
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,010
Wait for me here.

565
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,360
What are you staring at?

566
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,570
You've pulled me like this too.

567
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,030
You almost pulled me down.

568
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,610
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

569
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Are you going to fall?

570
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,000
Are you going to fall?

571
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,130
Are you going to fall? Are you falling?

572
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,070
No.

573
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,990
Give me five minutes.

574
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,240
So what if you have long legs?

575
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,560
It takes me ten minutes

576
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,380
to walk from here to the entrance of the community.

577
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,540
What if there are perverts around?

578
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,990
Perverts wouldn't be interested in you.

579
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,150
That's true.

580
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,900
You can go.

581
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
I'll stay here, not wandering around.

582
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,620
From now on, I'll be like Odysseus.

583
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,190
If you don't come, I absolutely won't leave.

584
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,870
You're pretty knowledgeable when drunk.

585
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,220
You even know how to quote the classics.

586
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,420
Alright, hold on tight then, Odysseus.

587
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,830
Idiot.

588
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,470
I'm not drunk at all.

589
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,380
I don't need hangover medicine.

590
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,770
I was just talking to you about life goals.

591
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,570
I'm as sober as can be.

592
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,320
Don't sleep, everyone.

593
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,620
I am back again!

594
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,190
I'm back!

595
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,060
I'm back!

596
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,660
Cheng?

597
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,210
Didn't you go to buy medicine for me?

598
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,870
How did you get back before me?

599
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,940
Ghost!

600
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,830
[Lu Yue; Gaming Role: Mid Laner; Weird Playstyle: One-Trick Shikigami Player]

601
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,850
What are you doing?

602
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,750
Cheng, there's a ghost in the training base.

603
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,510
There's a ghost there

604
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,070
that looks just like you.

605
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,240
It's super scary. I'm terrified.

606
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,940
Get off me, you drunken lunatic.

607
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,540
No, there's a ghost in the training base.

608
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,180
Get off.

609
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,870
I won't.

610
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,020
Tong Yao.

611
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,210
I hope that when you wake up tomorrow,

612
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,140
you won't admit what you did today.

613
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,430
So what if I do?

614
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,480
I could have peace for a month.

615
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,790
You are short and flat.

616
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,900
How dare you weigh over one hundred kilograms?

617
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,230
You're as heavy as a pig.

618
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,380
I'm letting go.

619
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:37,770
No.

620
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,040
One, two...

621
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,920
Don't you dare.

622
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,910
What are you doing here?

623
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,900
What?

624
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,420
You're not a ghost?

625
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,000
Have you ever seen a ghost as handsome as me?

626
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,190
You two look so alike.

627
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,540
We have the same parents.

628
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,270
Of course, we look alike.

629
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,320
Lu Yue?

630
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,780
Pro Ming.

631
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,940
Tell us, why are you back?

632
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,450
Well, I

633
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,190
was about to head to Kenya

634
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,720
to see the great migration.

635
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,780
But then I saw online

636
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,780
that your new recruit, Smiling,

637
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,880
was crushed by Tai.

638
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,950
I heard that she was bullied miserably.

639
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,270
I wasn't crushed at all.

640
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,230
I'm very strong.

641
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,530
At that moment,

642
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,990
a voice in my head said,

643
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,260
"Great Lu Yue,

644
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,940
it's time to return to professional esports.

645
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,110
So,

646
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,820
you're the Smiling who was crushed

647
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,230
so miserably by Tai, huh?

648
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,430
Is it your turn to ask questions?

649
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,360
I'm just asking.

650
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,960
Seeing how you two came in just now,

651
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,540
I thought she was your girlfriend.

652
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,860
I almost messaged my mom to share the good news

653
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,880
that her eldest son still likes women.

654
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,639
Now she

655
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,929
could finally have a good night's sleep.

656
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:16,630
Shut up.

657
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,050
Lu Yue, you're still the same as ever,

658
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:18,900
never serious.

659
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,949
But let me tell you,

660
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,540
we already have a new mid laner now.

661
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,469
You're too late.

662
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,070
What do you mean by "too late"?

663
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,530
Wasn't I banned from competing?

664
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,630
Coming back earlier wouldn't have made a difference.

665
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,460
What?

666
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,860
You were banned?

667
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,790
Serves you right. I'm so happy.

668
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,480
Can someone control this lunatic?

669
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,830
Well,

670
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
I hear ZGDX

671
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,530
locked in their starting mid laner

672
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,370
for this National League yet, right?

673
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,770
Pro Ming, I want to play in the competition.

674
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:49,989
No.

675
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,060
Then I'll send a message to Mom.

676
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,350
Mom,

677
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,360
the weather's getting cooler lately.

678
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,260
I passed by my brother's team today

679
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,660
and wanted to bring him some warm clothing.

680
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,510
But I saw

681
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,600
Pope, who he was rumored to be with,

682
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,350
had actually chased him all the way to China.

683
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,770
And there they were, together in bed...

684
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,040
embracing and kissing.

685
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,830
Try sending that; I dare you.

686
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,420
I'm serious.

687
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,020
You'll encounter that Team TAT again sooner or later.

688
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,230
Rather than hoping that your team's Smiling,

689
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,890
that is, this young lady here,

690
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,780
can regain her confidence and rise up in official matches,

691
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,620
defeating the person who once brought her despair,

692
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,550
it would be wiser

693
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,070
to prepare a reliable backup plan in advance,

694
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,420
someone who can leave Tai with no way out,

695
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,220
which is...

696
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,470
me.

697
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,790
Dreams are important, that's true,

698
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,650
and stories of rising from adversity

699
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,250
can make people teary-eyed.

700
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,270
But people

701
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,660
sometimes have to face reality.

702
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,380
After all, it's not like chanting slogans and marching in step

703
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,170
will make the championship trophy

704
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,230
roll into your bowl on its own, right?

705
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,420
Am I going to be a substitute for the substitute now?

706
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,770
Am I going to be the only one

707
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,890
stuck on the bench during the National League,

708
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,660
a starter who never gets to play?

709
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,820
Will I never be able to

710
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,110
play in the National League again?

711
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,060
I don't want that.

712
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,350
I want to play in the National League.

713
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,070
You can't keep me on the bench.

714
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,620
I lost only one game.

715
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,960
I don't want to stare at the water cooler.

716
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,060
Tong Yao, how much did you drink?

717
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,950
I didn't. I didn't drink.

718
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,410
I was drinking iced tea.

719
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,510
I'm not drunk.

720
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,740
Cheng,

721
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,790
I want to play professionally.

722
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,720
I want revenge.

723
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,580
I'm really good.

724
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,300
You can't make me watch the water cooler.

725
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,360
Cheng, how much did she really drink?

726
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,830
I don't know.

727
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,260
Tomorrow, let's report that bar across the street

728
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,920
for selling alcohol to minors

729
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,470
so we can check the surveillance footage.

730
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,100
Cheng,

731
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,710
this is for you.

732
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,140
This is my last gift to you

733
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,570
as a core player.

734
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,860
You see?

735
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,720
One crazy person on a team is enough.

736
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
We've already got our quota of one crazy person.

737
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,380
You can go ask

738
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,980
other teams if they need you.

739
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,340
What?

740
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,150
I'll go right now.

741
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,820
Pro Ming, this is for you.

742
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,320
This is for you.

743
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,530
This is for you.

744
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,900
Goodbye, farewell, and bye-bye.
