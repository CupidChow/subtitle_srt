1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry for the hammer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm sorry for the hammer.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
He won't leave here without a break.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He won't go to the scene again, right?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Brother Rui, let me go out.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's 11 o'clock. Why hasn't he come back yet?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He won't go to the beach, right?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Waiter, give me another bottle of tea.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're more than a ghost.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're a long-haired soldier.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But I saw the new smiley on the Internet.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
She was hugged by A-Tai.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I wasn't hugged. I'm very strong.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Am I going to kick the drum?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You can't kick me out.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I just lost a match.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't want to go to the waterfront.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Jiu Jing may let you have a good time.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But we won't.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What they say is what they say.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We can do it ourselves.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Jian Yang, you don't know me at all.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You don't know what I care about.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I care about it.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I never said what those people on the Internet said.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't like to be the one who makes things up.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
As her teammate,

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we must understand her at this time.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Li Jian Yang, for me...

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a belief.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You have to win the final.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How about building a new belief?

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Smiling,

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
it's time to face it.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Here.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Miss,

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What is this?

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,860
It's going to be late because she came andå¥¹ about to leave.

53
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,560
She really doesn't want to come here.

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,320
Come, put out the grass on the road.

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,040
Don't think my back may bother your kilograms.

56
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,120
Minifang, past poured,

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,600
the same goes for my arm.

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,440
I will do what I want to do.

59
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:55,980
Again?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,720
Don't blame anyone!

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,980
Continue.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,900
Forget it.

63
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,040
After leaving home,

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
over there,

65
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,600
you should take a break and relax.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,460
Chen'er,

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,500
can I have a number, please?

68
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,140
I don't want toasternity.

69
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,940
Sister Ling,

70
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,300
I'm trying to answer your number.

71
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,100
Can I have a number, please?

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:24,340
DenSE

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,580
Brother Cheng, I want to play the song.

74
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,780
I'll sing a song.

75
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,100
Let me play the song, okay?

76
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,140
Ready, go.

77
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,220
The stars in the sky are flying.

78
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,260
The flowers on the sky are dancing.

79
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,420
The birds are flying.

80
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,460
Who are you missing?

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,900
Let me play the song.

82
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,460
Let me play the song.

83
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,340
Give me a break.

84
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,340
Give me a break.

85
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
Don't move.

86
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Brother Cheng,

87
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,340
do you want me to do this?

88
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,340
No, I'm just a normal person.

89
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,340
I can't do this.

90
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
Brother Cheng,

91
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
girls are pretty serious.

92
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
Ding Xun,

93
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
take her out of the door.

94
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,340
Come on,

95
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
let's play the song.

96
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
Let's play the song.

97
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,340
Let's play the song.

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Brother Cheng,

99
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,340
I want to play the song.

100
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,340
Let's play the song.

101
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Let's play the song.

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Let's play the song.

103
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,340
Let's play the song.

104
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
Come on, stand up.

105
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Come on, who wants it?

106
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,340
Don't touch me.

107
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
Drink some water.

108
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,340
Come on, drink some water.

109
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,340
What?

110
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Mu Kong,

111
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
where is the yogurt?

112
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,340
There are five or six cans of it.

113
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,340
What are you doing?

114
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,340
What are you doing?

115
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
I'm thinking about someone.

116
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
I'm thinking about someone.

117
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
I'm thinking about someone.

118
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Thinking about life.

119
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,340
Thinking about life?

120
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
From which one?

121
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,340
Let me guess.

122
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,340
From...

123
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
the first second you were born,

124
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,340
you started to drink

125
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
the first cup of tea

126
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
in about 15 hours.

127
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
I'm the second child.

128
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Because the second child's content

129
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,340
has been rich,

130
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
it can make you think about it for a long time.

131
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
Sorry.

132
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
Did I do a lot of wrong things

133
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,340
last night?

134
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
Wrong?

135
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,340
No. What wrong?

136
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,340
Which one?

137
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,340
You mean

138
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,340
you saw my brother

139
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,340
and thought he saw my ghost soul?

140
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
Or you said

141
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
you were strong

142
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
in 100 Bt100?

143
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,340
You can't be a typo.

144
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
You lost the whole world

145
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,340
when you were a typo.

146
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,340
You said you were singing

147
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
the song of the second child?

148
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
By the way,

149
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
I'm telling you,

150
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,340
you really don't sing the song anymore.

151
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Because you really

152
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
sing the song of the second child.

153
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
No.

154
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
You're so stubborn.

155
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
No.

156
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
You even gave

157
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
the blood of the blood

158
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
to your teammates.

159
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,340
And you said

160
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
it was a compulsion.

161
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
You didn't say it.

162
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
You hugged him

163
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,340
and cried.

164
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,340
And you even had a cat's fur.

165
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
And you

166
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,340
couldn't even open

167
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
your ears.

168
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
And you even had a sore throat.

169
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
To be honest,

170
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
I woke up early

171
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
just to

172
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
get the vaccine.

173
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
So,

174
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
did you take the medicine?

175
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,340
What?

176
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
I took the medicine

177
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
and put it on your door.

178
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,340
I don't know

179
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
how to cure it.

180
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Don't say that.

181
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
I know I was wrong.

182
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
Who knows

183
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
there's a hotel in that drink.

184
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
What's the name of the hotel?

185
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
The Old Town Ice Tea.

186
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
Because there's no wife

187
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
in the Old Town Ice Tea.

188
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,340
There's no water in the pine tree.

189
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
There's no wind in the wind.

190
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
So,

191
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
the Old Town Ice Tea

192
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
is not tea.

193
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,340
And,

194
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,340
what did you wear

195
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
to look like a watercolour?

196
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Why do you wear this mask?

197
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
Do you want to kill

198
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
our good killer?

199
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,340
Can the mask be cut off?

200
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Why do you wear this?

201
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
It's embarrassing.

202
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
You embarrassed us yesterday.

203
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,340
You didn't

204
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,340
wear this mask.

205
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,340
I'm not wrong.

206
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,340
Go change your clothes.

207
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,340
They're going to wake up.

208
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
Hello, sister.

209
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
What's up?

210
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
You're looking for me?

211
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
Wake up.

212
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
What happened

213
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
in the bar yesterday?

214
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
I broke the record.

215
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Don't worry about it.

216
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
You just need to remember

217
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
that Brother Cheng,

218
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,340
he,

219
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
he,

220
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
and your ex-boyfriend

221
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
are all

222
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
in the same group.

223
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
I'm not sure

224
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
if he's the one

225
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
who's going to be the one.

226
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,340
I'm sure

227
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,340
he's the one

228
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,340
who's going to be the one.

229
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
I'm sure

230
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
he's the one.

231
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,340
I'm sure

232
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
he's the one.

233
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
I'm sure

234
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
he's the one.

235
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
I'm sure

236
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,340
he's the one

237
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,340
who's going to get you

238
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
in front of your ex-boyfriend.

239
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,340
Ex-boyfriend?

240
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
Jian Yang is here, too.

241
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,340
He's always been a man.

242
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,340
He calls her

243
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,340
when he has to call her.

244
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,340
Honey,

245
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,340
who do you think is the man?

246
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
Who's that?

247
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
Is something wrong?

248
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Yao Yao,

250
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
let's get back together.

251
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Yao Yao,

252
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
are you back to the base?

253
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Where are you?

254
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
You'll be in pain

255
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
when you're drunk.

256
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Remember to drink more hot water.

257
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Take it.

258
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
I'll help you.

259
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,340
Right here.

260
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,340
Here.

261
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Here.

262
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Here.

263
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Here.

264
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
Here.

265
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
Here.

266
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Here.

267
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,340
Here.

268
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
There are too many people here.

269
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
It's too crowded.

270
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,340
It's okay.

271
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Hurry up.

272
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
It's okay.

273
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
It's all good.

274
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
What's that?

275
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,340
Miss Xiao,

276
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,340
you're up so early

277
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,340
and you're still in bed.

278
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
How's your schedule?

279
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
Fine, Peng.

280
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,340
Why are you here?

281
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Lu Yue,

282
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
why are you back?

283
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
I'm back.

284
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
What's wrong?

285
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
What?

286
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,340
I was just

287
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
retired from the competition.

288
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,340
Why are you so surprised?

289
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,340
Brother Cheng,

290
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
where's Xiao Rui and God Ming?

291
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
Do they know?

292
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
They said they'd meet each other.

293
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
I'll go find God Ming.

294
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,340
Chen Hai.

295
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Woah!

296
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,340
What are you doing?

297
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,540
You do that for a reason.

298
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
How can you still stand here?

299
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
Why?

300
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Don't I need you?

301
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
No, you not.

302
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
I don't.

303
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
You won't.

304
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
You're abandoning me?

305
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
Yes, you won't.

306
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,180
I'm in my seat.

307
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,140
Really?

308
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,100
Then you should call her name

309
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,980
and she'll give you a chance.

310
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,060
Get up.

311
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,660
No.

312
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,460
Get up.

313
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,500
No.

314
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Oh my god.

315
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,340
Why are you holding my ear?

316
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,900
They're almost the second year of the century.

317
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,340
Why are they still like Ruo Zhi?

318
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,700
She's more like Ruo Zhi, right?

319
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,420
To make the chair

320
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,860
look like a pure flower.

321
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,380
If you're stupid, you'll believe me.

322
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,300
You're not stupid.

323
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,380
Anyway, it's my turn now.

324
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,300
Just say it.

325
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,340
Da Biao.

326
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,500
When did I hold your ear?

327
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,980
What's going on?

328
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,420
Why are you eating?

329
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,580
I'm afraid I'll steal your food.

330
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,420
It's a sign of the first-class meal.

331
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,580
You said I'm the best-class food for the world.

332
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,420
Then I'll make you pay for it.

333
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,020
Here.

334
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,220
Two pounds.

335
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,260
Thank you,atu.

336
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,060
Ow.

337
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,700
Sure.

338
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,500
Have you learned how to make noodles

339
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,380
a little by little?

340
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,500
You don't need to worry.

341
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,780
Everything I made

342
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,980
was practical.

343
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,100
Until now,

344
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,180
I'm sure you've learned everything to make noodles.

345
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,540
Right?

346
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,300
Those twoæ¯ real friends.

347
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,260
I'mo

348
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
I'll go over there.

349
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,260
When are you going to be crazy?

350
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,260
When are you leaving?

351
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,260
When my boss can't get the mouse.

352
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
When his boss can't get the mouse,

353
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,260
and doesn't want to take the position of the hand,

354
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,260
I'll wait until you can say this when you're done with the job.

355
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,260
It's been a while.

356
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,260
I've already lost my face.

357
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,260
I can't get back your face with the mask.

358
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,260
Let's eat.

359
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
Old Kei, Fatty.

360
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
What are you guys doing?

361
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,260
Why are you guys fighting?

362
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
What's wrong?

363
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,260
I'll go over there.

364
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260
This is not suitable for me.

365
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,260
I'll go over there.

366
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,260
I'm here to get the ZGDX.

367
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
I'm not going to get the mouse.

368
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,260
I'm just saying I can't sleep.

369
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
Some people are not only bullying me,

370
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
but also harassing me.

371
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
You're a bastard.

372
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,260
Why don't you care about the people he's scolding?

373
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,260
You're not sleeping?

374
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Why are you scared?

375
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,260
There's always a reason why I want to bully you.

376
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
How can I sleep?

377
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Look at this.

378
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Look at this.

379
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Look at this.

380
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
Look at this.

381
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Look at this.

382
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Look at this.

383
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Look at this.

384
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Look at this.

385
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Tai.

386
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,260
How about you?

387
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Does he know who's going to fight?

388
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
He chose the early game.

389
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
Why are you still picking the game?

390
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
This is my turn.

391
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
Why are you panicking?

392
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
Do you think

393
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,260
he's still that crazy this time?

394
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
Your brother and I are really good at one thing.

395
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
I'm confident and confident.

396
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,260
Pay attention to your words.

397
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,260
Anyway, this game doesn't matter.

398
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
I'm a smart guy.

399
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,260
I've probably been following the step in that game.

400
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,260
He's going to be picked up by the person who's going to be defeated by the enemy.

401
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Why do you care about his thoughts?

402
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
Xie Na.

403
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Keep going.

404
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Why are you so mad?

405
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
I'm just going to keep going.

406
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
I can't kill the enemy.

407
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
Am I right?

408
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Run.

409
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
Run.

410
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Run.

411
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,260
He's good.

412
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
He's doing it beautifully.

413
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
He's doing it beautifully.

414
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Don't hit him.

415
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
Don't hit him.

416
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
I'm going to beat him up.

417
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Right.

418
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
Isn't this girl's brain very good?

419
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,260
She wants to beat me twice in the same way.

420
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,260
It's me.

421
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
Right.

422
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,260
She can beat you.

423
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,260
She can beat you.

424
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,260
Why are you still afraid of me?

425
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,260
You're just a fool.

426
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
You want to beat me?

427
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,260
You're not a friend.

428
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
I have a partner.

429
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
Why are you making me do it?

430
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
To be honest,

431
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
if it was me,

432
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,260
I would have gone up.

433
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
I'm afraid of being beaten up.

434
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm afraid of being beaten up.

435
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,260
I'm more healthy.

436
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,260
Good.

437
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,260
Good.

438
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
You have to admit

439
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,260
that you still have two balls.

440
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,260
Do you know what is a back-up?

441
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,260
I've done all the competition videos

442
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,260
of A-Tai before.

443
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
I've been a famous sportsman.

444
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,260
I was in the middle of the game

445
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
when I needed to prevent the rain.

446
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,260
So the result of the game was very good.

447
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,260
What's the use?

448
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,260
No matter how good the result is,

449
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
the result of the game is useless.

450
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
We didn't even go to the finals

451
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,260
because of someone.

452
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,260
We finally won the prize.

453
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
You don't know

454
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
who the God of God is

455
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,260
so seriously injured.

456
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,260
I don't know what you're thinking.

457
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
I still have to stick to my opinion.

458
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
This person is going to be a substitute.

459
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
That's fine.

460
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
That's freedom of the club.

461
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,260
But I personally

462
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,260
don't accept such a teammate.

463
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
You guys continue.

464
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
I'll go and see.

465
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,460
Bro,

466
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,260
sorry.

467
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
How's your morning like?

468
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,260
You didn't say anything?

469
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
I'm sorry.

470
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
We're doing our part.

471
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,260
I don't even watch in time.

472
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

473
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
This thing is passing through so many hearts,

474
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,900
her.

475
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,780
She has my telling this right.

476
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,500
It was my mistake.

477
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,860
Built it today?

478
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm not the only one who's not the only one.

479
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm the only one who's not the only one.

480
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,260
I'm the only one who's not the only one.

481
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,260
I'm the only one who's not the only one.

482
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
I'm the only one who's not the only one.

483
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Do you know what is called a backup?

484
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,260
I've already done a lot of research on all the competition videos of A-Tai before.

485
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
I also worked as a bodyguard for the reputation.

486
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Every time I need to prevent the heavy burden, I'll be replaced.

487
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:26,900
A-Tai's

488
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,260
I've lost to a subordinate.

489
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,460
I saw him play the mid-term and he's a little bit six.

490
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,060
He's a bit more stable than me. What should I do?

491
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
I feel like my position is not full anymore.

492
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,860
I'm self-loathing. I'm unhappy.

493
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,660
I'm thinking of the mood.

494
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,860
I'm thinking of the glass heart.

495
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
Just before I follow you tonight.

496
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,260
Okay.

497
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,260
You just dominated the TOP round by five years ago.

498
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,460
I'm missing three matches at the end.

499
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,260
Since you recommend the Gold-eating Doll,

500
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,860
you should receive a gold-eating winner and see

501
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,460
if you should lose.

502
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,660
In the gold-eating those outside the competition stage,

503
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,460
the couples that invited you might not have any kids to their parties?

504
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,660
Using their faces you might have small to unfortunately understand.

505
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,220
It's clear that everyone thought that

506
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,700
ZDX is training in a closed-door

507
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,860
and preparing to fight for the overall final of the OPL.

508
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,300
ZDX officially announced a shocking news.

509
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,300
ZDX's team withdrew from the overall final of the OPL.

510
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,500
At that time, there was a big gap.

511
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,740
Some said that ZDX was eliminated by the withdrawal of the funds.

512
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,060
Some said that the internal problem was solved.

513
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,140
They couldn't fight at all.

514
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,100
Some said that they were too much pressure.

515
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,940
In short, they said a lot.

516
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,340
In the end, they didn't get a correct answer.

517
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,460
One year before the final,

518
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,420
the ZDX team didn't have a list of the winners.

519
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,700
Don't you think that

520
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,620
the severe injury on the god of the name is because of who?

521
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,020
Is it because of some things

522
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,660
that it has something to do with Lu Yue?

523
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,860
Or is it because he even got the god of the name?

524
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,900
No one discussed the death of Liang Yao Ling.

525
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,460
Did he just break up with A Tai?

526
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,900
The Chinese channel of Han Fu is all blown up.

527
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Could it be that he got the name of Lu Yue?

528
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,940
Lu Yue caused the god of the name so badly.

529
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,860
Don't come out and harm the Chinese radio, okay?

530
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,620
If you want to say the position of the first team,

531
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,620
I'd rather support Xiaoxie from Smeo Ling.

532
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,420
No.

533
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,820
How did Wang You know that Lu Yue is back?

534
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,500
I don't know what's going on.

535
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,180
Really, it's not me who made this up.

536
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,420
Did you see what he's like today?

537
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,980
This can't go on like this.

538
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,180
There are always some things that people say.

539
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,420
I thought things would change over time.

540
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,460
But I didn't expect that

541
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,820
he would be so bold and act like nothing happened.

542
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,100
He just came back like this.

543
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,820
He even said he was the god of the name.

544
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,140
Look, he even made a big announcement to the world

545
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,260
like a nobody.

546
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,460
Maybe he thought things would be over in a year.

547
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,500
But when the god of the name...

548
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,460
You guys are not sleeping at night.

549
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,700
You're working here.

550
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,580
Why aren't you sleeping?

551
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,820
I can't sleep.

552
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,900
What? You ate too much?

553
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,580
Because of Lu Yue?

554
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,980
You guys saw today's game.

555
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,860
Lu Yue's announcement is indeed more stable than mine.

556
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,060
Maybe he's the one who made the mid-term.

557
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,100
It's more suitable.

558
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,300
Don't worry.

559
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,580
Lu Yue will definitely not be the first one.

560
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,780
Not all mistakes can be made over time.

561
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,420
What do you mean?

562
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,740
Okay, Miss.

563
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,020
Don't think too much.

564
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,860
Drink up and go to bed early.

565
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,820
I'm too sleepy.

566
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,220
I'm going to sleep. Good night.

567
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,740
Good night.

568
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,100
Hello?

569
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,860
You're still sleeping?

570
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,740
I'm in heaven.

571
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,380
You're making a big fuss.

572
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,300
Hurry up and watch me post your video.

573
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,260
Our god of the name.

574
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,780
My god, I'm going to cry.

575
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,060
This is a fake video.

576
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm going to cry.

577
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,700
I'm going to cry.

578
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,940
This is a fake video.

579
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,180
I'm going to cry.

580
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,420
I'm going to cry.

581
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,420
This video is a fake video.

582
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,260
Look at this woman.

583
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,820
She's so cute.

584
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,700
Maybe Lu Yue took her place.

585
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,820
So she posted this video.

586
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,780
You're right.

587
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,380
She's so mean.

588
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,220
Okay, don't worry.

589
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,860
Don't worry.

590
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,140
We will surely get it.

591
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,220
It's not like we can't get it.

592
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,140
Okay, okay, okay.

593
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,700
Don't worry.

594
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,740
The lawyer is preparing.

595
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,900
We'll get it together.

596
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,620
We'll get it together.

597
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,940
Let me have a look.

598
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,420
What's going on?

599
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,700
What's going on?

600
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,580
What's going on?

601
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,860
What's going on?

602
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,740
Please get out of my way.

603
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,580
Please get out of my way.

604
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,660
Please get out of my way.

605
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,060
Brother Cheng, where is Fatty?

606
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,140
She went to the toilet.

607
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,660
She said she'd come down soon.

608
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,420
Hello, Tong Yao.

609
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,620
I'm Guan Bo Niang.

610
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,780
Guan Bo is about to be arrested.

611
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,900
He's in a deep discussion.

612
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,700
He's asking for the truth.

613
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,860
And Miss,

614
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,540
you've been on Weibo

615
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,180
and been put in the comment area.

616
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,340
Look.

617
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,220
All of them are fake.

618
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,020
You're so stupid.

619
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,780
Yes.

620
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,860
If you don't reply,

621
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,060
you can go.

622
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,300
We need to figure out a way to solve it.

623
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,380
Lu Yue,

624
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,860
don't look at it.

625
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,900
There are a few good words.

626
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,740
Don't look at it.

627
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,700
Xiaorui,

628
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,100
let me solve Guan Bo's case.

629
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,020
Hello, auntie.

630
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,540
Do you regret it?

631
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,580
Yes, it's me.

632
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,940
I told you that

633
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,220
the professional player is also a public figure.

634
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,260
He's a strict and stubborn person.

635
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,660
He's a low-key player.

636
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,260
Don't harm others and yourself.

637
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,540
First of all,

638
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,820
this must be from Lu Yue.

639
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,860
He just finished his competition and went back to the club.

640
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,900
Someone put the video out.

641
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,860
It's obvious

642
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,060
that he wants to use public opinion

643
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
to stop him from coming back.

644
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,700
This video

645
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,140
only has our own content.

646
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,660
To be honest,

647
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,260
why was the news so well-known?

648
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,460
Because I've seen this video.

649
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,980
I've seen the people who have watched it.

650
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,980
Plus, the staff and police of KTV

651
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,380
are absolutely not more than 20.

652
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,900
The security and police of KTV

653
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,940
are all young people who are three or four years old.

654
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,140
From their point of view,

655
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,500
this has nothing to do with the police.

656
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,820
It's just a group of young people fighting.

657
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,820
The rest of them

658
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,060
are only our club and the JK team.

659
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
The JK team

660
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,060
must not release these videos

661
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
because they are not good at this.

662
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,140
They didn't say anything good about this video.

663
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,820
At that time, they decided to put this video out

664
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,060
and it was a result of everyone discussing it together.

665
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,300
Their performance

666
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,740
is even worse than ours.

667
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
Why?

668
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,620
Isn't it Lu Yue's move?

669
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,580
But they're back.

670
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,060
The guard?

671
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,100
The guard is not that useful.

672
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,060
At that time, those people wanted to take revenge on Lu Yue

673
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,980
and put him on the ground

674
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,380
to take the weapon he was holding.

675
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,500
This is called the guard.

676
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,740
Later, they beat him up.

677
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,180
This is called fighting in the theater.

678
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,300
But in my opinion,

679
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,980
this is called fire.

680
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,380
Okay.

681
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
Anyway, this thing

682
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,180
must be done by us.

683
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,460
I don't know who it is.

684
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,500
But I, the representative of the club,

685
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,900
hope you can stand out

686
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,260
and solve this matter well.

687
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,340
It's raining outside now.

688
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,900
Everyone is standing on the wind tunnel.

689
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,140
If we don't solve it at this time,

690
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,340
then there will be a big problem.

691
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,780
I sent the video.

692
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,940
Fatty?

693
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,340
Tong Yao, I'm sorry.

694
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,060
I didn't expect to get involved with you.

695
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,980
I only want to talk about this with Lu Yue.

696
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,900
I still want to say that

697
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,300
he wants to be the representative of the club.

698
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,580
That's the freedom of the club.

699
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,740
But I personally don't accept such a team.

700
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,980
Fatty, don't say that.

701
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,540
You all agree to such a team.

702
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,420
I don't believe it.

703
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,220
I don't accept it either.

704
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,500
What are you talking about?

705
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:07,060
He is the most guilty master of the

706
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,500
special defense of the God of the Republic.

707
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,460
He must be given to all of us.

708
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,820
He is not the most guilty master of the special defense of the Republic.

709
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,260
God of the Republic,

710
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,300
you can cover all his mistakes

711
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,420
by protecting him like this?

712
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,260
Why, everyone?

713
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,340
I was a professional player when I was in school.

714
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,980
I also learned how to play the piano and play the piano.

715
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,820
But I didn't do that.

716
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,180
Why?

717
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,220
Because I knew I was a professional player.

718
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,420
Playing the piano

719
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,780
not only did I suffer punishment and injustice,

720
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,580
but also affected the club,

721
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,780
even the whole club.

722
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,060
Wang Xiaohe said,

723
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,500
because of you,

724
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,020
the whole professional life of God of the Republic is broken.

725
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,340
We can't go to the national finals

726
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,740
because of these bad things.

727
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,780
The whole team has spent a year of effort.

728
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,500
Uncle Wang,

729
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,580
do you know how people outside say about the industry?

730
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,020
They say we are blind, young,

731
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,820
and ignorant.

732
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,740
What's the point of playing the game?

733
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
I've heard this word for years.

734
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,220
After listening to it, I still can't understand it.

735
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,940
Because even if I try to explain to others

736
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
that we are not players,

737
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,340
we are not the little ones who know how to play the game.

738
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,140
Then,

739
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,020
there will be a team like you

740
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,340
who will prove to be 100,000 people with actions.

741
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,740
You are right.

742
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,340
We are the bunch of useless people you said.

743
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,220
My God,

744
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,340
the video is made by Xiao Pang.

745
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,420
Xiao Pang?

746
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,260
Xiao Pang?

747
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,940
My wife,

748
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,540
I made you a delicious breakfast.

749
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,140
Ta-da.

750
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,140
Come, have a cup of soy milk.

751
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,140
Xiao Pang and Lu Yue are fighting.

752
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,940
What should we do?

753
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
It feels awkward.

754
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,340
Who am I? Where am I?

755
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,340
What am I doing?

756
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,140
The video was really made by Xiao Pang.

757
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,740
It's the same voice,

758
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,140
but the same attitude.

759
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,340
My wife,

760
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,140
are you trying to say

761
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,140
that video of the game on the Internet?

762
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,140
I was playing it at that time.

763
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,140
Who is your wife?

764
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,140
You talk well.

765
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,140
You are still in the exam period.

766
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Don't force me to deduct your salary.

767
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,540
Are you still trying to be crazy?

768
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,140
You even touched my mouth?

769
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,140
My wife, don't be angry.

770
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
I want to show you something.

771
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,140
Look,

772
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,140
I'm not a bad person.

773
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
I'm not a bad person.

774
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
Look.

775
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
I'm a good person.

776
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
I'm a bad person.

777
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
I've been a good person for a long time.

778
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Don't force me to deduct my salary.

779
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,140
Don't deduct my salary.

780
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,140
Do you want to know the truth?

781
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,140
You know the truth?

782
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,140
Of course.

783
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,140
The truth of the matter is not on the surface.

784
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,140
Do you want to hear it?

785
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,140
Just say it.

786
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Or I'll get out of here.

787
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
Wait.

788
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
You caused such a big trouble

789
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
and brought us so many troubles.

790
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,140
It's just that you were just wandering around outside.

791
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,140
You can do anything.

792
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,140
You can do anything.

793
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,140
Why do you have to be so harsh?

794
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,140
Fatty, you're wrong.

795
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,140
Lu Yue didn't have the will to fight with others.

796
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,140
It's because the other party said

797
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,140
it was too hard to hear.

798
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
She was the one who touched her.

799
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
In this case, we all...

800
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
I won't.

801
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
Lu Yue was wrong.

802
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,140
Why do you keep protecting her?

803
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Don't say that.

804
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,140
I'm just a fool.

805
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,140
Even my teammates are so mean.

806
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,140
But what's the difference

807
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,140
between you posting a video and me fighting?

808
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
Don't you feel the same way?

809
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,140
The difference between me and you is

810
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
I have the will to be ashamed

811
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
and I have the right to be responsible.

812
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,140
But you

813
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,140
will always be a coward who will escape.

814
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
Say it again.

815
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,140
Say it again.

816
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,140
Say it again.

817
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Say it again.

818
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,140
Sit down.

819
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,140
Sit down.

820
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,140
Say it again.

821
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,140
Sit down.

822
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,140
Why are you here?

823
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Calm down.

824
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Chun Ruofeng, calm down.

825
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,140
Calm down.

826
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
I can't see the mirror.

827
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
As long as Lu Yue

828
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
doesn't turn around in front of me,

829
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
I feel much better.

830
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,140
I know

831
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,140
that the police say these things are very boring.

832
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,140
But that's what I think.

833
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,140
I know I'm a professional player.

834
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
I'm not doing anything

835
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,140
that's not good for me.

836
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
But I still can't get it right.

837
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
Why?

838
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
I know

839
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
that my way of handling is a bit extreme.

840
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,140
But I just don't understand

841
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
why can Lu Yue

842
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,140
turn around like this?

843
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
So

844
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
what happened a year ago?

845
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Come on.

846
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Everyone, you've worked hard today.

847
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,140
Relax.

848
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Right.

849
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,140
I'm really sorry today.

850
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
I'm just lucky.

851
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
I'm a gentleman.

852
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Come on. Let's drink together.

853
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
Come on.

854
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Come on.

855
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Come on.

856
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Manager Bao and Manager Han.

857
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,140
I'll drink first.

858
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
Drink.

859
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
It's just that the performance is still on.

860
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Jasmine is not here?

861
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
She's not feeling well today.

862
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,140
So she's not here.

863
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
Come on.

864
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
She's not feeling well?

865
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,140
Isn't she pretty good

866
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
when she was playing the game?

867
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Isn't she

868
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
not giving us a face?

869
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
No, no, no.

870
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Why can't we

871
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
not give her a face?

872
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
Come on.

873
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
Let me toast you.

874
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
She's really

875
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,140
not feeling well today.

876
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
How about this?

877
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
Let's have a little game today.

878
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
Okay?

879
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
Sorry.

880
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
A little game?

881
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
The second-to-final is called a little game.

882
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,140
You just can't get it right.

883
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,140
No.

884
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,140
Come on.

885
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,140
I'm really lucky today.

886
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,140
I'm a brother for you.

887
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,140
I'll toast you.

888
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,140
Okay.

889
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
This is Lu Yue.

890
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,140
This is Lu Yue.

891
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,140
Come on.

892
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,140
I'll toast you.

893
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,140
Come on.

894
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,140
Let's toast.

895
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
Come on.

896
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,140
I'll pour it for you.

897
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,140
Come on.

898
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Come on.

899
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,140
Come on.

900
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Lu Yue.

901
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,140
Okay.

902
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,140
Great.

903
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
Okay, okay.

904
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
You have a little game.

905
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,140
Right?

906
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,140
Yes, yes, yes.

907
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,140
Come on.

908
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,140
Come on.

909
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
I'll toast you.

910
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,140
Come on.

911
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,140
Come on.

912
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Come on.

913
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,140
Thank you.

914
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Thank you.

915
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,140
Thank you.

916
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Come on.

917
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
Come on.

918
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,140
Come on.

919
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,140
Later,

920
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,740
Lu Yue probably heard a brother

921
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,340
in the toilet

922
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
to check our team.

923
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,140
What kind of game is ZGDX?

924
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,140
Each of them is not qualified to be in the city.

925
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
Exactly.

926
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,140
Especially that one called Lu Yue.

927
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
What did he turn?

928
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
Isn't it just a team

929
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
that depends on his record score?

930
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,140
That guy is Lu Si Cheng's brother.

931
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,140
Lu Jiazhen is too tough.

932
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,140
He's already counted in the game.

933
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
His brother will be in the committee tonight.

934
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
But he still dares to call Xiao there.

935
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
He doesn't give us A-ge's face at all.

936
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
A-ge, you can't let him go.

937
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,140
You must give them some color.

938
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
But he's not a team member.

939
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
He doesn't give him A-ge's face.

940
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
What's the use of it?

941
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,140
Lu Yue.

942
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,140
Lu Yue.

943
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
Lu Yue.

944
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Lu Yue.

945
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,140
Lu Yue.

946
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Lu Yue.

947
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,140
Lu Yue.

948
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,140
Lu Yue.

949
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
Stop.

950
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
Let him go.

951
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,140
Lu Yue.

952
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,140
Lu Yue.

953
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,140
Let him go.

954
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,140
The situation is at this point.

955
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,140
Lu Yue is still the one who protected him.

956
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,140
A-ge was too hard to listen to.

957
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,140
He can't even accept the clear-minded person.

958
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
He's also Lu Yue who was drunk.

959
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,140
He also said Lu Yue didn't want to listen to others

960
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,140
saying he was a team member of Chengge.

961
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,140
But I don't understand.

962
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,140
Lu Yue didn't want to listen to others saying he was a team member.

963
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,140
That's proof of his strength.

964
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,140
He just listened to some rumors and started to play.

965
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,140
Just because of some rumors, he fought and even got famous.

966
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Why did he fight with A-ge?

967
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,140
He didn't have to quit.

968
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Just because Lu Yue loves Cheng,

969
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,140
he paid a lot of our debt.

970
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,140
Has anyone thought about it?

971
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,140
Hello, sister.

972
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,140
Jing Yang.

973
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
I'll call you later.

974
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,140
Don't hang up.

975
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,140
Go watch the live broadcast.

976
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,140
Lu Yue is in a meeting with Xi Yuan.

977
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,140
A meeting with Xi Yuan?

978
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,140
Jing Yang said he wants us to watch the live broadcast.

979
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,140
I'll watch the live broadcast.
