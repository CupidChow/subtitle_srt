as a bride

4
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,100
who stands alone

5
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,960
as an immortal,

6
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,100
or a woman?

7
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,600

separate downstairs from home.

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,340
Don't electric wires

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,440
helps in childhood?

14
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,140
How could you

15
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,700
take

16
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,500

The first day of the trip

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
The first day of the trip

21
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
The first day of the trip

22
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
The first day of the trip

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
The first day of the trip

24
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
The first day of the trip

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
The first day of the trip

The first day of the trip

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
The first day of the trip

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
The first day of the trip

29
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
The first day of the trip

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
The first day of the trip

The first day of the trip

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
The first day of the trip

00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
T accurate

34
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
It's not bad

35
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,960
The first day of the trip

36
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
I'm satisfied

37
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,700
Again

38
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
The first day without Suffering

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,320
The 제가

40
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,080
I'm satisfied

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,320
attering

42
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,140
��모

43
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
no

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
Episode 1

45
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Hello?

46
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Yang Yang,

47
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
look at what these people said online.

48
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
That's too much.

49
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
It's okay.

50
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
What nonsense have you seen?

51
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Don't be like them.

52
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm starving to death.

53
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,080
I haven't eaten anything on the way.

54
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
I'm just being unfair to you.

55
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
I dare to say

56
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
that every person who says these things

57
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
can beat you with their game.

58
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Then don't argue with them.

59
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Be careful not to hit my head.

60
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
You're going to hit my pink head.

61
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Your pink head is going to be hit by someone else.

62
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Miss Tong Yang,

63
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
when will you tell me

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
where the base is?

65
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
I'll pick you up.

66
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
My wife has blackened me.

67
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Can you help me persuade her?

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
We're standing next to your GGDX.

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
You're so mean.

70
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
You really want me to be your pink head?

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
No.

72
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Shuai Jia sent me a WeChat message.

73
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
She said

74
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
their base is next to GGDX.

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
She wants to pick me up.

76
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
I'm not a suspect.

77
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
I just want to

78
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
persuade her to send her WeChat message back.

79
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Stop it.

80
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm just being honest.

81
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Don't be so mean.

82
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
If you dare to help her,

83
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
you'll be in trouble.

84
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
I dare not.

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
But

86
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
do you think

87
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
my teammates will welcome me?

88
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Of course.

89
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
We're all human beings.

90
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
I can't be serious about you.

91
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
What age do you think you're still happy?

92
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Don't be so honest.

93
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
You joined GGDX.

94
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
They'll wake up in the morning

95
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
when they sleep.

96
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Do you think

97
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
they'll welcome me?

98
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Have you heard the story of

99
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Golden Thread Embroidery?

100
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Don't be so greedy.

101
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Okay.

102
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Enjoy your life in the capital.

103
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Bye.

104
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
The first place in the national team

105
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,080
to join the GGDX team in the morning

106
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,080
is the beginning of the traditional

107
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
play.

108
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
The first female professional player

109
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
in the North American game area

110
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
entered the finals.

111
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
After the GGDX team

112
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
was defeated,

113
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
the game was released.

114
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
The game was released

115
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
in the field of health.

116
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
How did she come here?

117
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
How could she be the first?

118
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
The GGDX team

119
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
spent a lot of time

120
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
to play Smiling.

121
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
She was convinced that

122
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
she was the first female professional

123
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
in the Chinese game area

124
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
since the final match

125
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
of the Pianjin Open.

126
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
She joined the GGDX team

127
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
and became the first female professional

128
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
in the game area.

129
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Okay.

130
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Look.

131
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
The GGDX team

132
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
found a female professional player.

133
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
She's so young.

134
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Smiling.

135
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
The game is not related to

136
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
the gender of the professional.

137
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
She doesn't know

138
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
why the male professional

139
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
used to stand

140
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
in the game.

141
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
The job is done

142
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
if she really wants to.

143
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Women

144
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
can't do it very badly.

145
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Is there any safety?

146
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
The male professional is your family's relative.

147
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
He speaks so much.

148
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
He's not your enemy.

149
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
He's a coward.

150
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Shut up.

151
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm sorry.

152
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Brother Cheng.

153
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Captain.

154
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
My CV boss.

155
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
This girl is the new

156
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
in our family.

157
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
You have to take care of her.

158
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Maybe tomorrow

159
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
the next day will come.

160
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
I heard that she brought

161
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
a cat-grabbing mouse.

162
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
But my shop is on sale.

163
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
The boss asked me to open the door.

164
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Okay.

165
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
What are you doing?

166
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
I don't like

167
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
the comments from the small number.

168
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Lu Si Cheng.

169
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
How did you open it?

170
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Thank you.

171
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
I'm a thief.

172
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
I'm so hungry.

173
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Brother Cheng.

174
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Can I have another one?

175
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Lu Ren Ju is too arrogant.

176
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
He can't bear to be a big man.

177
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
He's more than me.

178
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Brother Cheng is very arrogant today.

179
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Brother Cheng.

180
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
I suggest you to bear with me.

181
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
I'll go to the trial in the day after tomorrow.

182
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
If you don't want to be paid,

183
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
at least

184
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
you need to win

185
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
100 extra 3-digit gold medals.

186
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Brother Cheng.

187
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
It's cold.

188
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Don't fight.

189
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
You need to keep it cool.

190
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
It's 20% more expensive.

191
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
After this rule,

192
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Brother Cheng never

193
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
won the company he's been working for.

194
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Brother Cheng.

195
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Don't be so kind.

196
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
You're kind of rich.

197
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
It's expensive.

198
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
It's okay.

199
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
We have money.

200
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
No, Brother Cheng.

201
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
It's not my business.

202
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
I reported to ZGDX

203
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
and knocked on the door.

204
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
It was Brother Cheng who opened the door.

205
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Then he took my business.

206
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
He said thank you and knocked on the door.

207
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
So

208
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm standing at the door again.

209
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
I'll take you to the trial.

210
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
The trial is over.

211
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
We have to wait for the next day.

212
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Weibo Mountain.

213
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
No.

214
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
Weibo Mountain.

215
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
No.

216
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
And the last time,

217
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Weibo Mountain.

218
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
You apologize first.

219
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,080
I've never seen

220
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
a girl

221
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
beat up by a new lady.

222
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Yes.

223
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Amazing.

224
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Everyone is so diligent today.

225
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
I haven't finished the meeting yet.

226
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Brother Rui, I'll report to you.

227
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
You're here.

228
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Let me introduce you to everyone.

229
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
This is Tong Yao.

230
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
She's 19 years old.

231
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
She's the first in the national service.

232
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
She's 21 years old.

233
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
She's the leading figure in Hanfu Capital.

234
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
She's on the list of

235
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
99% male and female.

236
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Don't read the notice.

237
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
It's over, Brother Rui.

238
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Anyway,

239
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
from today on,

240
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Tong Yao officially became the new

241
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
member of the national service.

242
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
She's the new member of the national service.

243
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Welcome.

244
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Although you may know her,

245
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
I'd like to introduce her to you.

246
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
This is our top.

247
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
She's a cat.

248
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
She's a girl

249
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
who can be seen

250
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
by the outside world.

251
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
She's a boy.

252
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
She's a girl.

253
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
She's a little bit long-haired.

254
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Don't mind her.

255
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Who do you think she is?

256
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Sorry.

257
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm sorry.

258
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
You're so...

259
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
This is a support.

260
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
She can be a little fat.

261
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
She's a little bit short-haired.

262
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
She's a fat-haired fat-head.

263
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
I can be fat

264
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
if I'm fat.

265
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
I'm just a little bit fat.

266
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
It's okay.

267
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Don't bother me.

268
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
It's okay.

269
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
We can make a pair.

270
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
No problem.

271
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
That's K.

272
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Our partner.

273
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Don't look at her like that.

274
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
She's a middle-aged girl.

275
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
She's here.

276
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
She can be a little bit

277
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
chubby

278
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
in front of the middle.

279
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
She's famous.

280
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
If she's changed to someone else,

281
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
it's not a big deal.

282
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
No.

283
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Next,

284
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
we should

285
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
introduce her to the others.

286
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
DC.

287
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
I heard you just

288
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
closed everyone's door.

289
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I thought she's a delivery girl.

290
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
How could a delivery girl

291
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
like that have a cat?

292
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Who stopped the door?

293
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
You're not so important.

294
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm sorry.

295
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm so customers.

296
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
I can't let people do anything.

297
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
What do you want to say?

298
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I didn't say anything.

299
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Tell me

300
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
what you want to say.

301
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
He's even thinking about something.

302
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
What kind of scary life is this?

303
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Oh, right.

304
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Let me introduce you to everyone.

305
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
This is my cat.

306
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
He wants a big cake.

307
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
So?

308
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
So can I call you Brother Cheng?

309
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Your cat is called Big Cake.

310
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
What does it have to do with me?

311
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
These are two problems.

312
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
I saw your cat's little nephew.

313
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
I asked Brother Rui.

314
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
No one in the base is allergic to cats.

315
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
That's why I brought him here.

316
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Yes.

317
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Who?

318
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
My son.

319
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Brother Cheng, you don't call me your cat.

320
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
This is called food chain.

321
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
You can't suppress a cat's nature.

322
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
What if his cat eats my son?

323
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Buy it again.

324
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Can't you?

325
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
You can't lose a few points.

326
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
You can't lose a few coins.

327
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
You're full of sugar.

328
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Brother Cheng, don't worry.

329
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I will definitely get a big cake.

330
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
I promise you will be full of sugar.

331
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Okay, okay.

332
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
I will call Brother Cheng.

333
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Little Ye, let's go.

334
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
I will take you to see your room.

335
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Okay.

336
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Let's go.

337
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Little Fatty, let's go.

338
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
What are you laughing at?

339
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
You are full of sugar.

340
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
You can't lose a few coins.

341
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Is it funny?

342
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Little Ye, let's see.

343
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
How is it?

344
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
This is my new room.

345
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
The room where Xiaorui set up the room before

346
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
is the most difficult to find.

347
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Look at me.

348
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
I chose you from the Internet.

349
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Shaoyu limited edition.

350
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Shaoyu limited edition?

351
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
You mean what kind of misunderstanding

352
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
do you have about Shaoyu?

353
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Little Ye.

354
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Look at this.

355
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
I sent hundreds of stores

356
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
to find this kind of

357
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
oil pink flower.

358
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
And there are four types of lace.

359
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
These are lace.

360
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Beautiful.

361
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Is this pink?

362
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Is it eaten by the pig?

363
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Is it spit out?

364
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
And this.

365
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Look at this.

366
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
How beautiful.

367
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
I'm afraid that I'll miss my eyes.

368
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Look at this.

369
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
The lady of the fire bird limited edition

370
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
is so beautiful.

371
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
How beautiful.

372
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Little Ye.

373
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
How is it?

374
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Is it beautiful?

375
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
It's beautiful.

376
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
I told you.

377
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
You are the first lady to work.

378
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
You came to our team.

379
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
It's easy.

380
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
So we need to take good care of you.

381
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
You are especially important to us.

382
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Okay.

383
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
I think you are too tired.

384
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Then you should take your time to clean up.

385
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
Take a good rest.

386
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
I won't bother you.

387
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Oh, right.

388
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
I put a book on the table

389
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
for you to book a team.

390
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
But it's okay if you don't look at it.

391
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Xiaorui will take you

392
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
to the daily training in the daily life.

393
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Bye.

394
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
Bye.

395
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Little Ye.

396
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Welcome to ZGDX.

397
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Come on.

398
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Bye.

399
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
The first day of the team.

400
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
The cold brother Cheng.

401
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
A warm little friend.

402
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
The experience of the bedroom.

403
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Ha ha ha.

404
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Actually, it's still quite happy.

405
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Smiley.

406
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Let's go home.

407
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Dad, mom.

408
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
I'm at the base.

409
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Be careful.

410
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
It's going to happen.

411
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Can the door be locked?

412
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Show me the photo.

413
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
No, no, no.

414
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
These are all the training places of the police.

415
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
The door is locked.

416
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Send a photo.

417
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Yangyang.

418
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
What's wrong with your room?

419
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
What's wrong with your room?

420
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
What's wrong with your room?

421
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Dad.

422
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Dad.

423
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
We have a good picture here.

424
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Dad.

425
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Look.

426
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
These are all the rooms

427
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
my teammates set up for me.

428
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Dad.

429
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Although...

430
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
But...

431
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
But it's quite heart-warming.

432
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,080
But the door looks quite strict.

433
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Why do I think

434
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
the window is not very safe?

435
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Okay, Dad.

436
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
There's nothing wrong with the window.

437
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
You just put the window on.

438
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Your daughter is here to play the game.

439
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
She's not here to do any secret work.

440
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Look.

441
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I'm not worried about you.

442
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm worried about your safety.

443
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I haven't finished my words.

444
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
You've already said a few words.

445
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Your character is the same as your mother's.

446
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Don't be angry with me.

447
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
She's just a temper.

448
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
She doesn't follow me.

449
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Dad.

450
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
Mom is still angry.

451
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
It's been seven days.

452
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Fan Dongmei didn't give me a seat.

453
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Don't talk nonsense.

454
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Didn't you drink porridge?

455
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
You're a ghost.

456
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
You're a ghost.

457
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Didn't you win yesterday?

458
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
I didn't win yesterday.

459
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Besides,

460
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
why did you win yesterday?

461
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Let me ask you.

462
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Isn't it your precious daughter?

463
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Your precious daughter left after saying she left.

464
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Okay.

465
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
She left.

466
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Why did she say that?

467
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Why can't I say it?

468
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I'm her mother.

469
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
Why can't I say it?

470
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
I have to blame you for saying this.

471
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Why did you let her go?

472
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
She didn't go to the bank.

473
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
She's been hired by the government.

474
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
She's been hired by the government.

475
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
She's been hired by the government.

476
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Ask me.

477
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Where did your daughter go?

478
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
She went to play a game.

479
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
She's a college graduate.

480
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
She's playing a game.

481
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Yes.

482
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
I called her back.

483
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
What are you talking about?

484
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
She's still young and determined.

485
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
She's normal to play with.

486
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
If she really wants to go to the market,

487
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
let her try it.

488
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Maybe she'll be back in two or three months.

489
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Right?

490
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Yao Yao.

491
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
I'm telling you.

492
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,080
We don't lack her salary for two or three months.

493
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
Are you out of your mind?

494
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,080
How hard it is to find a job as a police officer.

495
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
You don't know that.

496
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Besides, Yao Yao.

497
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Yao Yao.

498
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
You're a hard-working college graduate.

499
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Do you know that?

500
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
How important the first job is to her.

501
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Playing a game.

502
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Playing a game as a police officer?

503
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Is it risky?

504
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
It's risky.

505
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Yes, it is.

506
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Look.

507
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
It's risky.

508
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Yes, it is.

509
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm not like you.

510
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
I don't know how to teach children.

511
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Okay?

512
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Come on.

513
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
What are you going to do?

514
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
What's the point of your phone?

515
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
I'm going to talk to Yao Yao.

516
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
What are you talking about?

517
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
I'm going to talk to Yao Yao.

518
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
It's because you have a father.

519
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
What's important?

520
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
Every time I talk, you talk.

521
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
I talk, you talk.

522
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Yao Yao is the one who's been kicked out by you since she was a kid.

523
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Da Bing.

524
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
You're going to officially train tomorrow.

525
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Are you excited?

526
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Let's go.

527
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Let's go.

528
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Get up at eight and a half o'clock.

529
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Get up at nine to train.

530
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Get up at nine to train.

531
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Fぶ Vishcial D finite rotation,

532
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
slightDonald.

533
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Why are you asking for one thousand yuan?

534
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,760
Here you go.

535
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,160
Good morning.

536
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,860
So cool.

537
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,080
Empress Thank you for the meal

538
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,020

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,020
Can send

540
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,600
Do I have enough

541
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,560
I suggest you pack up and leave.

542
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
This team has a rule.

543
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
I'm not allowed to bring a girlfriend here.

544
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
The one who brought a girlfriend last time

545
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
deducted half a month's salary.

546
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Girlfriend?

547
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
No, no, auntie.

548
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
You're wrong.

549
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm not a girlfriend.

550
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
I'm a team member who's working here.

551
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Team member?

552
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Girl?

553
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Girl.

554
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,560
Aunt, are you going to cook?

555
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
These are all the materials that Zhong Wu is going to use.

556
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Zhong Wu?

557
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Yes.

558
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Isn't it going to get up at 8.30 in the morning?

559
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,560
8.30?

560
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
These little ghosts are working hard.

561
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,560
They trained very late last night.

562
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
It's good to wake up at 12.30 today.

563
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
It's early to go to the store.

564
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
I suggest you go to rest for a while.

565
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,560
They'll play games with you in the afternoon.

566
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Aunt, such a big place.

567
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Are you cleaning alone?

568
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I usually clean and clean the place.

569
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
These professional workers at the cleaning shop

570
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
are looking for people online.

571
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Now this little girl is playing with the mirror.

572
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Congratulations to the champion of the OPL Spring Festival in 2019.

573

I'm going to go to the store.

594
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
I'm going to go to the store.

595
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm going to go to the store.

596
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm going to go to the store.

597
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm going to go to the store.

598
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
I'm going to go to the store.

599
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm going to go to the store.

600
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I'm going to go to the store.

601
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
I'm going to go to the store.

602
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm going to go to the store.

603
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
I'm going to go to the store.

604
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
I'm going to play pretend.

605
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
You're not good at nosso commanded her.

606
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,440
I'm going to go to the store.

607
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm getting a little mad.

608
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
I'm going crazy.

609
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
When it gets there?

610
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,440
There up there?

611
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Yes, this is my física.

612
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
It's yogurt water.

613
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
I'm going to get aget that.

614
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Agyan, you should go get your hydration.

615
00:21:42,440 --> 00:22:04,080
Go

616
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Good morning.

617
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Good morning, Changge.

618
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Good morning.

619
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Where are they?

620
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
What he amI Margse P fares at?

621
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,560
Margse P fares at?

622
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,600
.

623
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
Where are you?

624
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:58,740
Come on.

625
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Goddess Ming, you're back.

626
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
What did the doctor say?

627
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Nothing.

628
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Hello, Tong Yang.

629
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Hello, Goddess Ming.

630
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Is your hand better?

631
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Much better.

632
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Let's talk about the rules.

633
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Although Goddess Ming left,

634
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
she won't leave us.

635
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
From today on,

636
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,040
he will officially become the coach of ZGDX.

637
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,640
I knew it.

638
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,400
Wu Lin and Lin Shen will leave us.

639
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,760
You're back.

640
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,240
You haven't left.

641
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,160
Ming Shen.

642
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,040
I still miss the day you played the mid-game.

643
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,280
Now our mid-game is the same.

644
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,960
I will work hard.

645
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,600
The national team is coming soon.

646
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,840
I will be with Ming Shen.

647
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,120
I will practice with you.

648
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,400
I will practice with you.

649
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,320
From tomorrow on,

650
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
no one should sleep on the bed.

651
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,800
You should get up early.

652
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Get up early and watch Chen Qing Ling.

653
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,560
Chen Qing Ling?

654
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,600
I don't know what time he will be.

655
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,800
I don't think so.

656
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,320
He can do anything when he's resting.

657
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,040
Right?

658
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,840
Okay.

659
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,560
You're so funny.

660
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,480
Okay.

661
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,520
I will talk to him.

662
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,520
Don't mind.

663
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,240
Ming Shen has always been the mid-game.

664
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,800
He has the longest time in the team.

665
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,440
So he is very upset with our team's team.

666
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Especially K.

667
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,640
He is the one who is in the team.

668
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,840
He only recognizes Ming Shen.

669
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,240
So he will come to the team

670
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,680
and take care of the team.

671
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,840
Okay.

672
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,200
Let's practice.

673
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,640
Miss, come with me.

674
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,400
Okay.

675
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,000
Let's go.

676
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,880
Perfect.

677
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,720
Come on.

678
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
Miss, how do you feel today?

679
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,240
Not bad.

680
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,840
The little fat Superman

681
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,360
and the brother Cheng are playing with my eyes.

682
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,240
I didn't expect that

683
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,400
they would play like this.

684
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,040
You can see the strategy of the team.

685
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,000
There is a detailed rule of the team.

686
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,160
Also, there is a rule in the club.

687
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,040
Every member of the team

688
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,760
must be live for 45 hours every month

689
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,360
to complete the KPI live.

690
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,040
This is the contract.

691
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Take a look.

692
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,600
Oh, right.

693
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,560
Which platform did you use before?

694
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,480
Did you sign up?

695
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,440
I'm excited.

696
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,880
But I haven't signed up yet.

697
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
By the way,

698
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,840
I didn't show my face when I was on the live.

699
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,800
So I want to ask

700
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,320
if I can bring a mask?

701
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,160
Bring a mask?

702
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,040
Why?

703
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,480
It's safer to bring a mask.

704
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,640
You're a pervert.

705
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Okay.

706
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,360
Then bring a mask.

707
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,120
Then when the competition

708
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,680
and the new season are held,

709
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,800
you can bring a mask.

710
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,000
Someone must have said

711
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,640
that this girl is here to work

712
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,920
or to act as a girl in the city.

713
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,240
She will see it sooner or later.

714
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
She will be fine.

715
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,600
Besides, this is work.

716
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,800
You have to be brave to your fans.

717
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,920
Okay.

718
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,480
Once the corpse is lost,

719
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,800
let the convoy

720
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,200
make a toast to those who are in charge of the warplanes.

721
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,320
Let's drink this first.

722
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,520
Why does it have to turn yellow?

723
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,600
Let's�

724
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,600
ASMR

725
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,240
over rice.

726
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,160
Give it

727
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,080
to You.

728
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,240
Let's go.

729
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,040
Okay.

730
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,540
Hey.

731
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,640
You arrange a person later to take her to the supermarket.

732
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,040
Indeed.

733
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,640
She's coming today.

734
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,340
She must be buying some useful products.

735
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,440
I forgot.

736
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,540
I have to arrange it.

737
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,340
Brother Zheng, you take her there.

738
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,340
I remember what I just said.

739
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,940
You arrange a person.

740
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,440
Yes.

741
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,540
I arranged a person like you.

742
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:37,940
I'm busy.

743
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,340
Busy with the transfer?

744
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,340
You've already broken up with your friends.

745
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
So I'm busy.

746
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,040
I can't listen to the music.

747
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,240
From Shao Yun to Jingdu,

748
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Brother Zheng, you're a god.

749
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,240
Let's go.

750
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,240
Bye bye.

751
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,640
Bye bye, Mr. Ru.

752
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,240
Good morning.

753
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,840
Let's do it again.

754
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,840
Wait for me, Brother Zheng.

755
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Did I call you Brother Zheng?

756
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,040
Call me dad.

757
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
I suggest you be a person.

758
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
You've already called me, kid.

759
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,640
Hurry up.

760
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,440
Wait.

761
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
What kid?

762
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,440
We meet each other in the water.

763
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,840
I suggest you be kind.

764
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
What's the enemy's family?

765
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Because I never thought that my future team would be a child.

766
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
I'm 22 years old.

767
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,640
I graduated from college.

768
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,840
You have to tell me your height.

769
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,640
You're lying.

770
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,440
Weibo is gone.

771
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,440
No.

772
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,240
Who told you to lock me up in the door first?

773
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
You even said I love you.

774
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,440
Weibo is settled.

775
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,240
My friend.

776
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,640
Aijia?

777
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,640
Go.

778
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,040
Why are you staring at me?

779
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,040
What's wrong?

780
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,840
Tong Yao,

781
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,240
why don't you tell me?

782
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Your ex-girlfriend.

783
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,440
She's my friend.

784
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
I don't want to contact you.

785
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,240
You two know each other?

786
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,840
We both graduated from the same university.

787
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,840
She is my third sister.

788
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,240
Her mom is my teacher.

789
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,240
Her ex-girlfriend is my best friend.

790
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,440
And her...

791
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I ask you a lot.

792
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,040
Brother Cheng.

793
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,920
Yesterday, Mr. Fang said

794
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,760
he was the only one

795
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,960
in the professional team

796
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,920
of the Smaning team.

797
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,800
Brother Cheng,

798
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,560
you can take a look at your Smaning.

799
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,000
By the way, Miss,

800
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,200
my name is Liang Sheng,

801
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,520
the captain of YQCV.

802
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,600
We are standing next to you.

803
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,320
Welcome to the dinner.

804
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:25,920
Okay.

805
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,320
Don't eat too much.

806
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,000
Just a little bit is enough.

807
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,040
By the way,

808
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,440
let's have a date first.

809
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,520
No problem.

810
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,720
When we are new,

811
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,640
I'll have a date with Xiaorui.

812
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,120
It seems that you are looking for a new employee.

813
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,120
What's your location?

814
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,800
ADC.

815
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,880
Wait for the official announcement.

816
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,800
It's also a big news.

817
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,800
Who is it?

818
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't know.

819
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,920
Miss Tong Xiaoxiao,

820
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,880
just tell your best friend

821
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,000
that you are good at talking to me.

822
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,600
At least,

823
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,720
you can pull me out of the black兵.

824
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,440
Even if you tell me

825
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
why I broke up with you.

826
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,400
I can only tell you

827
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,720
that your ex-girlfriend

828
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,760
refused three overseas offers.

829
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And you only care about

830
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,520
how much I gave her

831
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,360
live-streaming.

832
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,120
2 hours later

833
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:11,960
ICA.

834
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,680
Get in the car.

835
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,680
Oh my god!

836
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:15,560
No př.

837
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,200
No sweetheart.

838
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,280
It's better to drive in this way.

839
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,040
Why?

840
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,120
It's good to sit while driving.

841
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,280
You won't open the car door.

842
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,880
No.

843
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,760
I shall drive it myself.

844
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,320
I have to buy

845
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
好偷卖 卖 snow Go to purchase slippers

846
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,440
还有日常洗手用品

847
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,160
And I may know

848
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,000
区进哪个商场

849
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,320
都可以 Da, where you'll check if they're in good shape.

850
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Or else, I'll take you to the gas station.

851
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Really?

852
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,320
Or if I need a ride, which, you should join me.

853
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,960
You missed me?

854
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,260
oda he pushed you to my house.

855
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,180
So i took a mismatch as i was getting in a truck for you.

856
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,040
So childish!

857
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,160
Okay.

858
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,480
When we were in the final a few days ago,

859
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,680
Xiao Yue said you were coming, too.

860
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,680
Yes.

861
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,840
We couldn't live in the same hotel.

862
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,520
Yes.

863
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,400
46th floor.

864
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,000
Yes.

865
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,360
No.

866
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,360
You were the one who rejected the paper.

867
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
It wasn't me.

868
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,760
You didn't admit yourself.

869
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,320
And you didn't admit yourself.

870
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,680
No.

871
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,640
Brother Cheng.

872
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,000
Listen to me.

873
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,240
I wasn't a good boss that day.

874
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,320
I took too many things and took them away.

875
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,440
So...

876
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,040
I rejected it.

877
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm going to start hating you.

878
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,880
Are you scared?

879
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
You're so mean.

880
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,920
You meanYN is...

881
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,240
Chiffon?

882
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,240
Chiffon is not mine.

883
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,580
It's not mine.

884
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,680
I was actually...

885
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,560
It's...

886
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,760
What's that face you have on?

887
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,600
I can't type.

888
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,520
Is that Glutinous Glutinous Glutinous Metktاض?

889
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,960
Do you think I could do anything at the most?

890
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,120
Of course, you have to.

891
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,240
I actually have a 죽èd ingredients when I need it.

892
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,440
Your gu conservative stepmother can't help me.

893
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,640
No matter what I did or I can't look at all of it.

894
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,440
With you,

895
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,880
you can have your reports as written.

896
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,000
He would take advantage of me and hard keep things away.

897
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,080
Tell me why.

898
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,120
You're pretending you know him, and how can you want to avoid that?

899
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,240
Don't think I'mрамitecting.

900
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,080
Although your dad wants to shut me up,

901
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,080
I don't want to hear this crap.

902
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,420
As long as you don't turn it on too soon,

903
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,560
I can ask if you want to 했습니다 try being replaced.

904
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,100
An backing writer never gives up on the past.

905
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,220
I saw it first.

906
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,220
I hid it first.

907
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,980
That's also called hiding.

908
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,180
Why not hiding?

909
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,700
Is it a kid who hides things in the supermarket?

910
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,580
I'm afraid to buy it for others first.

911
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,420
I thought I was lost for a few days.

912
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,860
I didn't expect to be the same.

913
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,780
What do you mean?

914
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,100
Talk to the captain.

915
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,220
I can't stand it.

916
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,420
Why is it so fast?

917
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,540
Beauty is the first.

918
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
What are you doing?

919
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,740
Live streaming.

920
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,900
Xiaorui,

921
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,980
I talked to you about live streaming KPI.

922
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,380
You didn't argue with her.

923
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,420
The reason why girls should be out early

924
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,220
is to let her watch you for less than an hour every month.

925
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,380
45 hours or 35 hours?

926
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,220
What's the difference?

927
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,820
When you make up for live streaming,

928
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,820
you'll know there's a difference.

929
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,100
What do you mean?

930
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,580
Just like the summer vacation of your kindergarten,

931
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,700
you stayed until the last day.

932
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,980
Who's kindergarten?

933
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,900
Can you talk about it?

934
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,620
The warning from the man in front of me.

935
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,100
I've only done this once in my life.

936
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,500
What are you running?

937
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,900
You dare to take photos of me?

938
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,700
What?

939
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,660
What's wrong with him?

940
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,620
What's wrong with him?

941
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,700
He's so cute.

942
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,620
What's wrong with him?

943
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,260
I didn't make up for it today.

944
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,140
How can I see him?

945
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,260
And I haven't posted a photo on the Internet.

946
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,580
Do you think your fans will be kind to me

947
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,820
and give me a beauty camera?

948
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,380
They're coming.

949
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:11,860
Hold on.

950
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,700
Don't let them catch me.

951
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,580
You can stand it.

952
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,060
I'm not sure if it's true.

953
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,700
You're so happy to be here.

954
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,020
Can you sign for me?

955
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,660
Ting, are you okay?

956
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,300
I saw Guoxuan said

957
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,420
he's been in treatment for a long time.

958
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:20,860
Is it true?

959
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,540
Chen, you're so tall.

960
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,300
You're getting taller.

961
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,060
Oh, no.

962
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,100
Is this going to be exposed?

963
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Brother Chen,

964
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,580
this is your girlfriend.

965
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,460
He's kidding.

966
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:29,980
What should I do?

967
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,660
No.

968
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,300
I'm looking for a girlfriend

969
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,500
who looks like a girl.

970
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,820
She's a staff member of the team.

971
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,860
She comes out to buy things with me.

972
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,260
You're so cute.

973
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,260
You're childish.

974
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,180
Miss,

975
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,420
help me and Brother Chen drink some wine.

976
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,700
No, no, no.

977
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,020
No, no, no.

978
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,500
Thank you, Brother Chen.

979
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,180
Let me do it.

980
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,820
Let me do it.

981
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,140
Here's Dongyun's slip certificate.

982
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,940
In diagnostics.

983
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,260
If you don't understand them.

984
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,700
Go inside and have a look.

985
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,380
Why doesn't he know what it is?

986
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Hello.

987
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,060
Xing Wen.

988
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,460
來到.

989
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,660
Ск pół–

990
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,380
Brother Cheng.

991
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,580
Brother Cheng,

992
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,300
do you think I will have so many fans in the future?

993
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,060
Will they like me so much

994
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,620
and be afraid of me?

995
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,380
You have to enter the finals in advance.

996
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,780
If you lose because of your team,

997
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,020
then you will be more than

998
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,620
a hundred times more popular than this.

999
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,180
Every day, I will ask you if you have a drink.

1000
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,660
If you are not drunk,

1001
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,300
why didn't you blow the wind outside?

1002
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,180
You will be afraid of your team.

1003
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,820
Just like Kei.

1004
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,860
Do you mind?

1005
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,580
To be honest,

1006
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,300
if you mind,

1007
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,340
you can have a good match.

1008
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,260
In the world of electronic economy,

1009
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,140
only the strongest can get recognition.

1010
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,660
You will be questioned a lot.

1011
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,220
But if you prove with your strength,

1012
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,460
you can replace the famous god,

1013
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,940
no one will say anything more about you.

1014
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,140
But Brother Cheng,

1015
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,140
why doesn't it seem like

1016
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,340
no one has ever questioned you?

1017
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,300
Because I am strong.

1018
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,580
The food in the electronic economy is the original sin.

1019
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,820
Let's go.

1020
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,100
Come on, Kei.

1021
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,860
Go to the middle.

1022
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,380
This way.

1023
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,940
That way.

1024
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,540
That way.

1025
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
What is that?

1026
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,100
You are back.

1027
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Looks like Brother Cheng is still with his new team.

1028
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,340
He is very happy.

1029
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,860
Happy?

1030
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,500
Just like taking the daughter of the kindergarten girl

1031
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,220
to the supermarket to buy 0.1 billion yuan.

1032
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,860
No.

1033
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,940
Then you sit here.

1034
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,100
I will go to the middle.

1035
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,940
I will go to the middle.

1036
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,740
I will go to the middle.

1037
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,540
I will go to the middle.

1038
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,260
I will go to the middle.

1039
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,980
I will go to the middle.

1040
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,740
I will go to the middle.

1041
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,580
You sit here.

1042
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,780
Isn't this your seat?

1043
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,620
Not good, right?

1044
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,220
It's okay.

1045
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,900
The seat is all made of wood.

1046
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,660
Look.

1047
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,340
This is the latest electronic economy

1048
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,740
that I have changed for you

1049
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:02,940
according to Xiao Pang.

1050
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
This is the most professional.

1051
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,740
You can adjust it according to your personal habit.

1052
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,900
Believe me.

1053
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,500
I guarantee that you won't be tired

1054
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,380
even if you fly for a whole day.

1055
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,100
Xiao Yi.

1056
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,900
Come on.

1057
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,180
What's the point of just fighting?

1058
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,740
The next few days,

1059
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,020
the team is training hard.

1060
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,340
If you can't stay,

1061
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,620
you can see the first performance.

1062
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,380
Don't be nervous.

1063
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,580
Brother Cheng always...

1064
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,740
Yan Ge.

1065
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,420
What is this?

1066
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,180
It's a pink dress for young girls.

1067
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,380
Take it off.

1068
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,260
Put it aside and have a look.

1069
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,380
I will make up for you.

1070
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,100
This is all my favorite.

1071
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,300
I like it.

1072
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,020
No.

1073
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,620
You like it?

1074
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,460
This picture is a bit of a party.

1075
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,300
Miss.

1076
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,980
Don't be forced to do it.

1077
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,380
I will tell you your new voice.

1078
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,460
Not all girls like pink.

1079
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,460
I'm just a young girl.

1080
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
You just bought a pink hairband.

1081
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,020
Brother Cheng.

1082
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,020
I recommend you to buy it.

1083
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,700
This is the terrible boy.

1084
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,860
Go away.

1085
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,220
What's wrong?

1086
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,020
Don't be rude.

1087
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,020
Xiao Yi.

1088
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,820
Do you want to buy a pair of shoes?

1089
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
I want to buy a pair of shoes.

1090
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
I want to buy a pair of shoes.

1091
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,980

I want to buy a pair of shoes.

00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980

1130
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,980
I want to chase after the light.

1131
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,980
If I had a dream,

1132
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,980
I would chase after the light.

1133
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,980
So we are in the front.

1134
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,980
We will light up the dark night.

1135
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,980
The street is dark, how much is it?

1136
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,980
How much is the star that is full of glory?

1137
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Remember that moment when the wind was strong.

1138
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Please don't forget.
