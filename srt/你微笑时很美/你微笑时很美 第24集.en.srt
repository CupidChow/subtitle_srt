judging something new based on their experience.

And at first, my parents didn't agree either.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,750
My parents didn't agree at first either.

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,550
My parents didn't agree either.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,150
It's normal.

7

10
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,710
everyone else's parents had clear stances.

11
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,840
They are against it.

12
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,320
What's there to talk about?

13
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,390
Your family doesn't support you to play esports?

14
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,760
My dad is okay.

15
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,470
But my mom...

16
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,860
Subconscious criticism.

17
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,400
What esports?

18
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,030
It's just playing video games.

19
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,030
You kids

20
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,800
are addicted to games, and your studies are affected by that.

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,930
And you find some grand excuses for it.

22
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,770
Refusal.

23
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,470
Come here, you brat!

24
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,270
Brat!

25
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,790
Few people believe their passion

26
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,290
and no one understands

27
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,030
what this passion means

28

to them.

29
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,170
How dare you ignore my calls?

30
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,210
Come back!

Are you here for…

That brat.

That fool!

38
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,910
He ran away as soon as he saw me.

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,550
Go get that brat here.

40
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,210
Uncle, Auntie, don't be angry.

No, no, no.

-We…
-Rui.

45
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,670
Just call me Rui.

Here's the thing.

Now, the national policy is good.

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,110
Our town

50
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,240
gave our family one more piece of land.

51
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,430
His younger brother just got married.

52
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,470
We're considering building a new house

53
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,630
for his brother.

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,710
They can't always

55
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,590
live with us.

56
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,610
Am I right?

57
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,420
Yes.

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,780
Young people do need their own space.

59
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,890
A few years ago,

60
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,290
his father injured his right hand

61
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,770
because of a work injury.

62
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,720
Now, he can't do any heavy work

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,680
or find any job.

64
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,520
Everything at home,

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,510
big or small,

66
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,060
all costs money.

67
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,650
Think about it.

68
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,450
Where can we get the money?

69
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,130
Yes.

70
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,510
We know

71
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,610
it's not easy for him

72
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,810
to work outside.

73
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,400
What's not easy for him?

74
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,010
His brother is in the countryside. He can't compare to him!

75
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,560
Now,

76
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,050
his brother is in urgent need of money

77
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,420
to build that house.

78
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,660
We just want to borrow some money from him.

79
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,790
Why is he unwilling?

80
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,240
He didn't even answer our calls.

81
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,370
Is he unwilling now?

82
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,190
We can't even see him. Think about it.

83
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,380
Who does he think he is?

84
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,440
We are his parents.

85
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,870
How could he not answer our phone?

86
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,980
He ran away as soon as he saw me.

87
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,710
Of course we're disappointed!

88
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,079
By the way,

89
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,240
if we had a way,

90
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,520
I wouldn't have come here to find him.

91
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,550
Are you his leader?

92
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,510
Kind of.

93
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,650
Since you're here,

94
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,950
I just want to ask

95
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,720
how much money he can make

96
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,010
by playing the games?

97
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,030
Well,

98
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,650
we signed a contract with our team members.

99
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,190
Their salary is confidential.

100
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,870
Logically,

101
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,370
he should tell you himself.

102
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,340
I shouldn't be the one to do it.

103
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,750
Confidential?

104
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,550
I'm his father.

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,350
His things were all offered by me and his mother.

106
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,880
Exactly.

107
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,050
I just want to know

108
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,400
how much money he can make

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,130
by playing games?

110
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,860
Well,

111
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,900
it's really inconvenient for me to…

112
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,450
Stop talking.

113
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,800
This is all my savings since I started my career.

114
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,840
Besides the money I give you every month

115
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,110
and my daily expenses,

116
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,040
the rest is all here.

117
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,550
Take it all.

118
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,040
Do whatever you want.

119
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,440
You can build a house for him

120
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,430
or use it to buy betrothal gifts for him.

121
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,430
Go gamble with it.

122
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,260
Squander it.

123
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,920
No need to make up so many excuses.

124
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,430
It's all yours now.

125
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,310
Dad.

126
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,030
Mom.

127
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,570
Thank you for raising me.

128
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,659
But please don't come to the training base again.

129
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,550
Don't bother me again.

130
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,060
Don't come here to bother my teammates, either!

131
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,830
You...

132
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,720
What are you doing?

133
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:07,990

134
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,430
Rui,

135
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,310
please help them

136
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,370
book tickets for them to return home.

137
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,220
Deduct the money from my next month's salary.

138
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,290
Look at him. He's getting more and more unreasonable.

139
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,550
What's all that about?

140
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,790
You threw it away.

141
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,520
You'll never get it back.

142
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,830
Some things just don't matter.

143
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,860
Since young,

144
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,940
everything I've done is wrong.

145
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,250
My brother has always been right.

146
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,320
When I wanted to study, they said I was not made for it

147
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,640
and asked me to learn from my dad and be a craftsman.

148
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,760
I didn't want to.

149
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,720
I insisted on going to school.

150
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,310
I learned to play games at that time.

151
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,060
I made money by smurfing.

152
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,960
Tong Yao.

153
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,950
You know what?

154
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,560
At that time,

155
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,490
I didn't like playing games at all.

156
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,680
I thought it was just a tool to make money.

157
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,580
If I hadn't met God Ming,

158
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,630
I might never know

159
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,070
what esports is.

160
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,070
Later, I loved it.

161
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,470
I finally understood it.

162
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,909
But to my parents,

163
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
I'm still their tool to make money.

164
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,140
Actually, it's understandable.

165
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,190
People of their generation

166
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,830
need more communication.

167
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,200
My parents are the same.

168
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,190
Haven't you seen them before?

169
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,950
Tong Yao.

170
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
We are different.

171
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,470
How?

172
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,290
Your parents are good.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,080
They love you.

174
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,960
While I...

175
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,870
So, I have nothing

176
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,750
except esports.

177
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,980
You still have us.

178
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,940
Tong Yao.

179
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,510
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,950
I was against you before.

181
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,130
I'm sorry about what I said

182
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,679
when your parents came to the training base.

183
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,340
It's been so long.

184
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,110
Why do you still remember it?

185
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,440
I've long forgotten it.

186
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,960
Let's go, K.

187
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,080
Let's go back to the training base.

188
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,790
Why did you call me here so early?

189
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,900
Sister, I was impulsive.

190
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,030
What's wrong?

191
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,920
Come. Let me show you.

192
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,840
Look at this.

193
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,430
What is this?

194
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,380
The equity transfer agreement of YQCB.

195
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,100
Transferee: Chen Jinyang?

196
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,870
Did you really buy YQCB?

197
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,750
Of course.

198
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,180
Can it be that I forged it?

199
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,250
Boss, I bought the Rio you asked.

200
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,600
What flavor would you like?

201
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,320
Peach flavored.

202
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,280
Did she really buy your team?

203
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Of course.

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,160
She's the boss and manager of our team.

205
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,010
Well...

206
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,870
Is it okay?

207
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,830
Yes.

208
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,400
I've thought about it.

209
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,360
Although

210
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,300
I'm not gifted in games,

211
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,910
and I know nothing about this industry,

212
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,350
I'm smart.

213
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,700
I can learn everything.

214
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,510
Besides, I think

215
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,740
the esports industry is really promising.

216
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,430
My dad also thinks

217
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,630
there's potential in this investment.

218
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,020
My honey is so smart.

219
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,270
Of course.

220
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,940
I'll go back and digest the news.

221
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,010
Don't go yet.

222
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,860
I have something to discuss with you.

223
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,790
What is it?

224
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,310
Didn't you tell me last time

225
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,250
about K's parents coming to the training base?

226
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,190
Later, I found that

227
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,000
many parents are like his parents.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,880
They think playing esports is playing games.

229
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,640
You make a lot of money easily.

230
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,490
Ai Jia also thought so before.

231
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,790
Don't mention me.

232
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,630
I used to like playing games,

233
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,860
but since I started a professional career,

234
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
I think it's too hard.

235
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,680
That's right.

236
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,220
There are no such easy things

237
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,700
that allow you to have fun and make money easily.

238
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,440
Many people can't see

239
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,790
the pain and pressure behind the esports professionals.

240
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,430
That's why many parents

241
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,730
don't understand why their children play esports.

242
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,730
Sister, you've grown up.

243
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,380
Of course.

244
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,030
Do you think I'm just a boss

245
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,430
who only harasses her team members all day?

246
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,360
Besides,

247
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,180
ever since I bought the team,

248
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,550
I've been thinking

249
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,700
of doing something for the team.

250
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,750
So,

251
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,610
I have a great idea now.

252
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,940
Are you

253
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,810
going to buy ZGDX, too?

254
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,820
To dominate the esports industry?

255
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,510
I'm not as rich as Cheng.

256
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,840
I plan to

257
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,400
hold a carnival for you and Ai Jia.

258
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,870
A carnival?

259
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,780
What are we going for?

260
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,160
We're going to the event held by other teams?

261
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,190
It's the alma mater of me and Ai Jia.

262
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,930
So, I must go.

263
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,630
Well...

264
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,190
I don't think it's a good idea.

265
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,270
Our schedule is so full lately.

266
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,840
A carnival?

267
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,350
Cheng didn't agree

268
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,710
to the last event I mentioned.

269
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,270
This time, I'm sure...

270
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,150
Okay.

271
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,470
Okay.

A carnival?

273
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,470
Sis,

274
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,670
is your alma mater's canteen good?

275
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,350
What a chowhound!

276
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,920
A carnival at the college?

277
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,690
Is it a performance?

278
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,400
Silly.

279
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,740
This is a stage to show the charm

280
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,420
and the actuality of esports.

281
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,260
Look at you.

282
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,910
You trained late every day.

283
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,620
Either you have dark circles under your eyes

284
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,470
or your skin is dry and rough.

285

Your skin hasn't been well lately.

288
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,120
I used a hydrating face mask called "Little Reservoir."

289
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,840
It's very moisturizing.

290

Why don't you try it, too?

291

Hello, Seniors.

317
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,910
I have a question for you, Senior Tong Yao.

318
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,570
Did you start to like playing games

319
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,420
because of the game itself

320
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,330
or your boyfriend at the time?

321
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,550
Indeed, it was him

322
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,440
who led me into the world of games.

323
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,930
But it is me

324
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,720
who took esports as my career

325
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,890
and dream.

326
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,250
So, in a relationship,

327
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,350
if one person likes playing games,

328
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,950
while the other hates playing games,

329
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,630
does that mean

330
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,580
they are not meant to be together?

331
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,130
I'll answer this question.

332
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,120
I believe in this world,

333
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,660
there aren't two people who are exactly the same,

334

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,710

is a professional player who has a chance to make it to the Finals.

339
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,450
The other one is a real-world girl

340

who only knows how to buy skins

341
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,790
but has no clue what items to buy at the start of the game.

342
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,720

Ai Jia

348
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,580
doesn't understand my things, either.

349
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,510
He doesn't understand why

350
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,220
I have 200 pairs of shoes, while I have only 2 feet,

351
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,470
and why I have 500 lipsticks,

352
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,000
while I only have one mouth,

353
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,870
and they are almost all the same.

354
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,440
But he knows to compliment me.

355
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,470
Even though he looks at the computer for more than ten hours a day,

356
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,470
he still notices

357
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,150
that I've changed my hairstyle and dyed it

358
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,260
or that my clothes today look better than yesterday.

359
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,300
His attention to me

360
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,590
will never be taken away by the game.

361
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,390
So, it's the same for me.

362
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,090
I don't know anything about games.

363
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,920
But I know

364
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,920
esports embodies a spirit of sportsmanship.

365
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,350
He's not been indulging in meaningless distractions

366
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,080
or hiding in the gaming world to seek false glory.

367
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,230
It's just another form

368
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,730
to prove his strength to the world.

369
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,990
Just like now,

370
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,360
Ai Jia's taste has greatly improved.

371
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,350
And I

372
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,750
also found the direction for my future career.

373
00:16:52,750 --> 00:17:00,350
Great!

374
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,550
Okay. Any other questions?

375
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,260
Miss.

376
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,440
I have a question for Senior Tong Yao.

377
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,800
How did you manage to become the Lord of Heian-kyo in the game

378
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,380
while also balancing your studies

379
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,980
and graduating with honors?

380
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,790
I think it's about managing my time effectively.

381
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,380
Your priorities should be

382
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,970
based on your identity.

383
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,589
If you are a student,

384
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,190
you have to

385
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,829
plan the time properly

386
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,680
after your schoolwork is done.

387
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,030
Nothing can be an excuse.

388
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,970
So, when I was a student,

389
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
I studied even harder.

390
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,510
Because I didn't want those people

391
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,170
who didn't know esports to say

392
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,830
that playing games was just being caught up in trivial pursuits.

393
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,430
Of course,

394
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,780
now, everyone

395
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,150
knows more about esports

396
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,150
and have fewer misunderstandings.

397
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,480
The data shows

398
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,830
that last year,

399
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,950
The World Championship

400
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,640
has already reached tens of millions of viewers.

401
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
The data

402
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,000
has actually exceeded

403
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,100
many traditional competitions.

404
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,190
As we know,

405
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,630
more and more universities,

406
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,470
for example, Communication University of China

407
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,550
has set up an esports major

408
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,430
to send professional talents

409
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,390
to the future esports industry.

410
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,860
Yes.

411
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,360
So, I'm very grateful to my good friend, Jinyang,

412
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,610
for holding this carnival.

413
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,950
We hope

414
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,900
you can learn more about esports

415
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,700
through contact with professional players.

416
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,350
We will also try our best

417
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,350
to change your opinions on players,

418
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,940
become the pride of Chinese esports,

419
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,600
and show the world the power of Chinese players.

420
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,600
Okay, this gentleman, please.

421
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,420
Hello, Senior Ai Jia.

422
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
I'm your fan.

423
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,110
I heard a lot about you

424
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,910
when I first entered the school.

425
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,000
I wonder

426
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,830
when people around you didn't know esports

427
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,960
or even rejected it,

428
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,310
how have you stuck to it until now?

429
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,330
When you fought against everyone alone,

430
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,320
have you ever thought of giving up?

431
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,630
I...

432
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,520
never thought of giving up.

433
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,190
But I did

434
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,280
hurt my family

435
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,270
because of my passion

436
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,260
for games.

437
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,780
I used to be

438
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,020
like a little troublemaker:

439
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,350
rebellious,

440
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,630
willful, reckless,

441
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,990
gave up my studies,

442
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,240
and ran away from home.

443
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,390
Aren't you leaving?

444
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,080
Go.

445
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,820
You've grown up anyway.

446
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,880
You're capable now.

447
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,930
Whatever I say, you won't listen to me.

448
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,890
All you do is play games all day.

449
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,780
Playing games!

450
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,310
How many times have I told you?

451
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,460
Have you heard of it?

452
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,630
Tell me.

453
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,490
What future can you have in playing games?

454
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,500
How can you contribute to the society?

455
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,710
This is what I like.

456
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,790
I won't give up.

457
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:02,870
Mom,

458
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,990
can't you understand me a bit?

459
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,270
I understand you?

460
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,800
What can I understand?

461
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,670
As a teacher,

462
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,680
I can teach so many children well.

463
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,940
Why can't I teach you well?

464
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,370
Let me ask you one last time.

465
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,930
Are you still going to play games?

466
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,470
Yes.

467
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,640
Okay.

468
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,870
Get lost!

469
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,560
After you leave,

470
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,060
don't ever come back!

471
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,620
So,

472
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,580
from the day I started working as a pro,

473
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
I told myself

474
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,860
I wouldn't go back home

475
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,950
without achieving certain results.

476
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,830
I wanted everyone to know

477
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,980
that not everything that's unusual is wrong.

478
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,720
I can be responsible for my choice.

479
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,870
I know,

480
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,270
in real life,

481
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,600
many people don't understand our profession.

482
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,640
They think the esports players are

483
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,550
just wasting their time.

484
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,110
It's no different from spending time at an internet cafe.

485
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,310
Maybe you just see the live-streaming tips,

486
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,430
the fanatic fans,

487
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,280
and those multi-million annual salaries and bonuses.

488
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,310
But I have a question.

489
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,450
Are those all true?

490
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,050
Like all sports projects,

491
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,180
esports

492
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,110
is a competition between the top players.

493
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,200
The training, teamwork, and stress tolerance

494
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,550
that these top players go through

495
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,050
are by no means easier than any traditional sports

496
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,380
and rival those of traditional athletes.

497
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,610
A senior once said

498
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,640
our world

499
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,260
is as cruel as other sports,

500
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,960
because there are too many failed cases.

501
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,280
Talented ones may not be able to succeed.

502
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,490
Those who succeeded

503
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,130
may not be remembered.

504
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,560
Those who are remembered,

505
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,590
may not have good results.

506
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,070
So,

507
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,490
those professional players who made it

508
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,640
have all made more effort than others.

509
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,190
Their efforts determined their upper limits,

510
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,710
just like you

511
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,680
do exercises, memorize words,

512
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,860
and study for IELTS.

513
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,500
If you failed,

514
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,580
would you regret playing games?

515
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,690
Although esports is about playing games,

516
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,870
the process of gaining success is not a game.

517
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,950
I tried.

518
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,590
Even if I fail, I won't regret it.

519
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,710
Youth is not an excuse to cover up mistakes.

520
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,590
But we can only be young once.

521
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,470
If you decide to do it,

522
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,400
you have to be determined to never turn back.

523
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Okay, everyone,

524
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,170
this year's championship has begun.

525
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,560
The finals will be held in Shanghai.

526
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,870
It's a great honor.

527
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,910
Please cheer for your seniors

528
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,220
and cheer for Chinese esports!

529
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,590
Go! Go! Go!

530
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:42,020
Go! Go! Go!

531
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,750
Go! Go! Go!

532
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,890
Where is Jinyang?

533
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,420
She's still busy.

534
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,720
Let's go.

535
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,230
What's the rush?

536
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,980
Auntie, you're too polite.

537
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,790
Hello, Ms. Lin.

538
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,220
When you graduated,

539
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,480
you said you didn't know what suited you.

540
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,250
It's been less than a year,

541
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,860
and yet you are so excellent.

542
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,910
You've been invited back for a speech.

543
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,540
No.

544
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,850
It's all because of Jinyang and Ai Jia.

545
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,150
Ai Jia.

546
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:31,900
Mom.

547
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,940
I didn't expect you to come.

548
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,640
Jinyang asked me to come.

549
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,890
She talked to me for a long time

550
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,480
about you,

551
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,030
about esports,

552
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,620
and about your career.

553
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,300
I thought I wouldn't come.

554
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,380
Jinyang convinced me.

555
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,950
Actually, until now,

556
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,810
I still don't understand

557
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,510
what you said about esports

558
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,010
and clubs.

559
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,580
But I understand one thing.

560
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,540
My son has grown up.

561
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,860
He can

562
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,790
make the right choice

563
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,840
for his life.

564
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,560
I believe

565
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,090
he is growing up,

566
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,290
and he will succeed.

567
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,800
I have a class to attend. I have to go.

568
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,090
Auntie.

569
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,800
Mom.

570
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,630
I haven't been back to school for a long time.

571
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,890
How about

572
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,750
I take a walk with you?

573
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,680
Sure. Sure.

574
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:08,360
Come.

575
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:09,680
Let's go.

576
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,250
Go ahead.

577
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,650
I'll wait for you here.

578
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,970
Can you come back to see your dad

579
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,490
if you're free tomorrow?

580
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,470
Bring Jinyang along.

581
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,250
We can

582
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,970
have a meal together.

583
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,290
We'll see.

584
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,760
Are you that busy?

585
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,240
I need to make money, right?

586
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,350
If one day,

587
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,040
my photo is up there, that will be so nice.

588
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,330
Don't worry.

589
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,300
You'll get everything you want.

590
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,900
Breaking news!

591
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,200
Big news!

592
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,000
-What's wrong?
-Hurry up.

593
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,160
Are ZGDX's double Cs in love?

594
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,350
I thought something was wrong.

595
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,310
As a girl,

596
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,260
I think eyes can't fool people.

597
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,790
Let me have a look.

598
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:21,950
This.

599
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,740
The first time Lu Sicheng mentioned

600
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,950
Tong Yao in the interview with Best Contestants,

601
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,670
he praised her for being excellent.

602
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,580
Being strong.

603
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,670
He lowered his gaze, his eyes soft at the corners,

604
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,890
and a faint smile lingered on his lips.

605
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,970
That time Pang stepped on the Tong Yao's shoes and broke them,

606
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,310
it was Lu Sicheng who carried her.

607
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,190
That GIF is a must-have.

608
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,480
Look at this. And this.

609
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,280
Look.

610
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,770
The first time they went to a movie,

611
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,720
they got caught by fans.

612
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,240
Tong Yao looked up at Lu Sicheng.

613
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,100
The fans quickly found out the solid evidence of their relationship.

614
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,950
Amazing.

615
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,200
What are you looking at?

616
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,340
Is the carnival thing trending on social media?

617
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,220
No. No. No.

618
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,660
Let me show you the photo.

619
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,050
Isn't it exciting?

620
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,810
My goodness.

621
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,570
This...

622
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,890
Why isn't a good thing like the carnival trending,

623
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,040
but this is?

624
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,540
When did our team's double Cs get together?

625
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,740
I'm the team manager, but no one told me!

626
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,740
Tong Yao, what's going on?

627
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,050
Why did our team members know this

628
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,380
later than the followers of Esports Farm?

629
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,010
When did you start

630
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,450
dating secretly?

631
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,960
The clues can be hidden,

632
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,510
but the way you look at people can't.

633
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,010
You can't.

634
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,810
What look?

635
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,650
The netizens are really like Sherlock Holmes.

636
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,890
-Go downstairs.
-Either they are

637
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,880
definitely together

638
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,940
or Cheng has an unrequited affection towards Tong Yao.

639
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:48,880
Tong Yao?

640
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,250
We dare not ask Cheng.

641
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,120
Hurry up and tell us.

642
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,580
Some netizens have already made a bet that they'll stand upside down to eat dung.

643
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,630
Look at this.

644
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,290
What is it?

645
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,840
Their eyes are brimming with love!

646
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,470
Oh my god.

647
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,920
It must have been photoshopped!

648
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm going to throw up.

649
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm going to send it to my mom.

650
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,000
It's summer.

651
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,850
It is the season

652
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,490
that your eldest son is in heat.

653
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,690
He used to hide it well.

654
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,950
He probably couldn't cover it this year…

655
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,840
Why are you so clamorous in the middle of the night?

656
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,830
I can't even sleep.

657
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,220
Someone in Esports Farm said you have a crush on Tong Yao.

658
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,930
They obviously said we're secretly dating.

659
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,510
No.

660
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,030
The original poster said

661
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,660
she could tell from your eyes that you had a crush on Tong Yao.

662
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,760
Tong Yao was watching the game,

663
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,290
and you were peeping at her.

664
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,910
Yes, I have a crush on her.

665
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,680
Boring.

666
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
It's just a joke.

667
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
No one says you are really together.

668
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,290
My cat is incurable.

669
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,770
Don't worry.

670
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,860
I'm here.

671
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,820
Go out and change your brain.

672
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,670
[Onmyoji Arena]

673
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,800
Alright.

674
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,850
Ladies and gentlemen, both here and watching from home,

675
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,760
hello.

676
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,080
This is the live venue of the 2020

677
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,680
National League for Onmyoji Arena.

678
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm Dudou.

679
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,450
I'm today's commentator, Qiu.

680
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,120
Today's matchup is CK versus Red Arrow—

681
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,050
a clash of titans

682
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,960
and yet another thrilling game ahead!

683
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,020
We can look forward to the fancy moves of God Yang again.

684
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,590
Look, it's Cheng and Smiling.

685
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,760
Is there another sequel to "The Legend of the White Snake" of esports?

686
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,300
Well...

687
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,600
♫I'm most afraid when it suddenly becomes quiet♫

688
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,240
When you sing,

689
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,890
I forgot what I was going to say.

690
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,680
But these people are really good at making trouble.

691
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,750
It's so awkward.

692
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,520
Why are you awkward?

693
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Didn't you say you didn't visit Esports Farm?

694
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,720
I...

695
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,680
Well...

696
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,560
After the commentary,

697
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,970
I won't visit it.

698
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,610
Like many players, when they lose the game,

699
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,370
they will also

700
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,400
uninstall the app.

701
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Afraid of being scolded?

702
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,960
Yes.

703
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,250
However,

704
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,520
if there's some big news,

705
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,100
I'll go take a look.

706
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,980
After all, as a commentator,

707
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,730
I can't afford to be too out-of-date with the news, right?

708
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,390
I really underestimated you.

709
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,130
While we're focusing on the games…

710
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,800
It's too awkward to sit here.

711
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,600
How can we compete in the future?

712
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,870
Hang in there.

713
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,750
It'll start soon.

714
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,420
No one will say anything when it starts.

715
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,810
I guess you're a lurker

716
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,810
on Esports Farm.

717
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,390
Isn't that Lu Sicheng?

718
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,320
ZGDX is here to watch today?

719
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,050
God Yang.

720
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,490
I can still clearly remember

721
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,490
that moment from the Spring Season.

722
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:52,520
God Yang,

723
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,350
I have to remind you today.

724
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,330
You have to stay calm today.

725
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,870
The director is stirring up trouble again.

726
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,570
The relationship between Smiling and Chessman

727
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,840
is really under the spotlight.

728
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,360
Yes.

729
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,970
Well, the two of them do look good together.

730
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,600
Wait.

731
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,590
I figure

732
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,690
something big will happen today.

733
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,150
Be careful not to get hit by their fans later.

734
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,560
Photographer,

735
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,660
you're going against me too, aren't you?

736
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,340
I shouldn't have come today.

737
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,360
What?

738
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,570
What is the photographer up to?

739
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,920
But it's a bit special today.

740
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,240
They're two players.

741
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,050
I wonder what they will do.

742
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,570
What are you expecting?

743
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,480
Kissing.

744
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,290
Are you stupid?

745
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,440
So stupid.

746
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:32,860
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

747
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,860
What's going on?

748
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,530
-You didn't report it to the club.
-Big news!

749
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,870
Mom, look!

750
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,180
This passion means…

751
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,490
Am I being cheated on?

752
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,490
Flinging your caution to the winds.

753
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,550
God Yang.

754
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,770
It's not that serious. God Yang. Jian Yang.

755
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,480
Alright, don't be angry.

756
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,760
Calm down.

757
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,620
Before the game starts today,

758
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,520
we found that the camera had caught

759
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,930
the ADC, Lu Sicheng

760
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,180
and the mid laner, Tong Yao from Team ZGDX.

761
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,960
They actually kissed

762
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,120
in public

763
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,520
and made their relationship public.

764
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,910
Everyone there was shocked by it.

765
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,570
And Jian Yang, the jungler of Team CK, who was on the stage,

766
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,690
was so angry that he threw his mouse.

767
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,290
You are amazing.

768
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,640
If it were me,

769
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,000
I would brag about it even to my grandkids.

770
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Back then,

771
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,650
your grandpa and I

772
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,670
kissed

773
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,240
in public.

774
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,180
Are you bombed?

775
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,280
I guess my parents

776
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,960
will come to the villa soon.

777
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
What did they say?

778
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,900
What could they say?

779
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,330
My mom was confused.

780
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,390
She asked me whether I came here to be a pro

781
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,790
or to play an idol drama.

782
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,930
And my roommate in college for four years

783
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,370
wants to cut ties with me.

784
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,910
Who told you to date the esports beau

785
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,050
while playing games?

786
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,820
You didn't even tell anyone.

787
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,470
Of course your friendship will crack.

788
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,540
Stop laughing.

789
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,750
What should I do?

790
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,610
What do you mean?

791
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,520
Just wait to marry into the rich family.

792
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:12,880
Or

793
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,580
wait for Mrs. Lu to smash 5 million to your forehead

794
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,180
and tell you to leave her son.

795
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,050
I didn't want to announce it.

796
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,620
I knew I'd be criticized so.

797
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,170
What if there's a problem

798
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,030
in the competition in the future?

799
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,050
What if I get hit again?

800
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,970
What if Lu Sicheng's fans jump off the building?

801
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,970
Just mind your own relationship.

802
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,630
Why are you worried about others?

803
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,890
As long as Cheng loves you, it's all good.

804
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,600
I love you, too.

805
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,460
Look, you have a lot of love.

806
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,570
They described me as if I was possessed.

807
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,470
I started to doubt

808
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,520
whether it's truly bad that an esports player

809
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,690
dating.

810
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,570
You didn't

811
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,280
start dating today.

812
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,000
When you started dating,

813
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,260
nothing was affected.

814
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,680
Everything was fine, right?

815
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,520
What? He's such a good man.

816
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,150
Are you going to give him away?

817
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,610
Get out!

818
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:13,970
Click it.

819
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,790
Shut up.

820
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,620
Focus.

821
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,880
So noisy.

822
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,350
Did you take some drugs?

823
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,160
Wake up!

824
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,780
So annoying.

825
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,330
[Mrs. Lu]

826
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,110
Hello.

827
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
I was playing a game.

828
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,620
I didn't see it.

829
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,300
I told you it's not…

830
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,720
You were just guessing.

831
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,850
Why are you blaming me if you're wrong?

832
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,100
That girl…

833
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,670
Yes.

834
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,280
That girl is Tong Yao.

835
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,770
Yes.

836
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,720
She looks young,

837
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,770
but she's already over 18 years old.

838
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
It's not illegal.

839
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,610
What was that sound?

840
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,190
I kissed her.

841
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,770
What?

842
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,560
You're coming to Shenzhen?

843
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,440
What are you doing in Shenzhen?

844
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,600
Don't scare her.

845
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,410
What do you mean by "What is her family like"?

846
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,360
Can you stop acting like

847
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,650
a gossipy old woman?

848
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,800
If you keep being unreasonable, I'm hanging up.

849
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,050
Cheng,

850
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,590
it's Mom, right?

851
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,930
Dad saw it, too.

852
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,080
He said he couldn't get through to you.

853
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,610
Get lost.

854
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,410
My brother has been on the phone for a long time.

855
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,870
He must be thirsty. Me too.

856
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,720
Get us a cup of honey water each.

857
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,150
In your dreams.

858
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,320
I'm your future brother-in-law.

859
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,790
If you don't flatter me now,

860
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,190
you will suffer in our family in the future.

861
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:00,960
Rui.

862
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,530
What are you doing?

863
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,460
I'm looking for a house for Tong Yao.

864
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,990
She has to move out quickly.

865
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,630
I guess you won't see my brother anymore.

866
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,400
I'll change her door to a security door.

867
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,150
It's useless to install 100 doors.

868
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,550
That girl will open the door for my brother.

869
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,310
Will she?

870
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,690
Okay.

871
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,780
What's wrong?

872
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,580
My mom insisted on coming to Shenzhen.

873
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,920
Mrs. Lu?

874
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:27,440
[Check: 5 million yuan]

875
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,920
Five million.

876
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,220
Leave my son.

877
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,010
Five million.

878
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,070
Leave my son.

879
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,640
Conniving little shrew.

880
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,480
Who are you referring to?

881
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,240
Shameless!

882
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,160
Why did she find a boyfriend if she's playing pro?

883
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
The upper poster is scarily jealous.

884
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,450
If ZGDX doesn't win the championship,

885
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,400
she'll be a sinner forever.

886
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,330
Is Tong Yao bad?

887
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,290
How could she be a sinner?

888
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,000
Don't you know who would drag Lu Sicheng down?

889
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,320
Why didn't you say that he'd be distracted

890
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,200
by fujoshi's shipping of him and Pope?

891
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,700
Fujoshi fans don't disturb anyone.

892
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,310
What a foul mouth.

893
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,600
Who cursed first?

894
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,290
I'm a man,

895
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,970
but I also think Cheng is a disappointment this time.

896
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,600
I hoped he could win the national championship.

897
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,440
I don't know what he's doing.

898
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,890
I almost laughed to death by the upper post.

899
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,510
Is Tong Yao a femme fatale or what?

900
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,690
She's just dating Lu Sicheng.

901
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,930
The league has only completed half of the season,

902
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,600
and she didn't lose once.

903
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,420
But now you're saying they can't win the championship this year?

904
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,880
Schemer Tong is indeed a femme fatale.

905
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,700
She's a selfish person who only cares about her relationship instead of the whole team.

906
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,000
Disgusting. I want to vomit.

907
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,410
And she wants to play professional esports like that?

908
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,490
She's just a little girl.

909
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,520
You're really something, Schemer Tong.

910
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,450
Apologize to her now.

911
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,280
Interesting.

912
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,770
The victim hasn't said anything yet.

913
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,280
You jump out and accuse the victim.

914
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,810
Do you have any conscience?

915
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,030
Don't be nervous.

916
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,670
Later,

917
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,670
as the team manager,

918
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,140
I will admit my mistake first.

919
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,360
We'll cooperate with each other.

920
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,160
It'll be fine.

921
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,480
They're coming.

922
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,010
Mr. Li.

923
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,000
Ms. Wang.

924
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,220
Continue the meeting.

925
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,060
I was the one who pursued her.

926
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,190
And I asked to make it public.

927
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,710
I'll bear all the consequences.

928
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,730
Well,

929
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,570
I just had a meeting with the PR department.

930
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,760
We have developed an emergency

931
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,190
public relations plan for this incident.

932
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,400
The competition is coming soon.

933
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,160
We promise

934
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,640
we won't affect the later games

935
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,840
because of personal issues.

936
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,900
Don't worry, boss.

937
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,480
Hello, Ms. Wang, Mr. Li.

938
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,670
Come out and explain.

939
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,920
The netizens are scolding me on the official account.

940
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,640
Look.

941
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,080
There are all kinds of criticisms.

942
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,480
I can't stand it anymore.

943
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,080
Hurry up and issue an official statement.

944
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,480
What are you waiting for?

945
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,300
Ms. Wang.

946
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,420
Do you think

947
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,950
we can deal with it this way?

948
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:09,800
Okay.

949
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,260
Just do it this way.

950
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,460
Please go out.

951
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,850
Okay.

952
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,200
Here, Mr. Li.

953
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,180
You two, wait a minute.
