1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,541
Your Majesty!

3
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,545
The deposed Queen Yoon
must be given capital punishment!

4
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,713
He is right.

5
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,590
Yi Ik-hyeon plotted treason

6
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,467
by posing as a Royal Physician!

7
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,888
His mother, the deposed Queen Yoon,
must have known of his plan.

8
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,307
You must also execute Yoo Sang-uk
and Prince Uiseong

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,267
for taking part in the rebellion!

10
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,935
Execution?

11
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,105
Do you have evidence
that Prince Uiseong took part in it?

12
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,568
We have circumstantial evidence
and witnesses.

13
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,404
Prince Uiseong is the one
who killed Yi Ik-hyeon, the rebel.

14
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,449
However, you must not let him live

15
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:18,203
in order to prevent future rebellions.

16
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,664
How could you ask
a father to kill his son?

17
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,584
Please punish the deposed Queen Yoon

18
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,670
and execute Prince Uiseong!

19
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,547
-Punish them.
-Punish them.

20
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,257
Please decide for the greater cause

21
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,967
and execute them as they deserve.

22
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,761
-Execute them.
-Execute them.

23
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,806
-Execute them!
-Execute them!

24
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,699
Yi Ik-hyeon…

25
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,827
died in the palace.

26
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,876
Not only did your revenge fail,

27
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,546
but your safety is also in danger now.

28
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,973
I do not care.

29
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,019
For I no longer…

30
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,774
have a reason to live.

31
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,866
The child of Yi Ik-hyeon is still alive.

32
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,874
It is Prince Uiseong

33
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,752
who took part in the rebellion.

34
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,476
You are…

35
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,605
indebted to me.

36
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,442
On one condition.

37
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,696
I will ask you a favor later.

38
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,573
Whatever favor it is,

39
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,451
promise me that you will grant it.

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,682
Please let the child of Ik-hyeon…

41
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,936
live.

42
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,066
That is…

43
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,986
my favor.

44
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,211
Kill Prince Uiseong.

45
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,882
If you do not put out the ember now,

46
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,260
it will come back to you as a big fire.

47
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,845
That boy

48
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,473
is the first child I held in my arms.

49
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,767
That is nonsense!

50
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,854
Prince Uiseong is the son of Yi Ik-hyeon!

51
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,189
I will make the decision!

52
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,650
I will also defend this throne

53
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,235
in my way.

54
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,320
Your Majesty.

55
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,032
Why do you make this harder than it is?

56
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,368
Just destroy everything
that stands in your way.

57
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,537
That is my way.

58
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,915
That is how I put you on the throne.

59
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,086
All you have to do is become a sage king

60
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,672
so the blood they shed was not in vain.

61
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,842
No!

62
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,554
I will no longer
taint my throne with blood.

63
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,349
It still reeks of the stink of blood

64
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,894
you smeared 20 years ago.

65
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,146
So?

66
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,274
Will you expose that I am the one

67
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,651
who killed Crown Prince Taein?

68
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,239
I would like to see you try.

69
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,659
However, the moment you expose it,

70
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:13,081
you will be denying the legitimacy
of your enthronement yourself.

71
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,250
Who would recognize you as their king

72
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,921
if you do not recognize
your own legitimacy?

73
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,884
My only mistake

74
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,472
was that I let Yi Ik-hyeon live back then.

75
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:35,978
Do not repeat the same mistake I made.

76
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,454
What do you think I should do?

77
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,379
You have already made
many great achievements,

78
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,965
so please let go of the past.

79
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,551
My wish

80
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:11,764
is that you will be
remembered in history as a sage king.

81
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,143
If I…

82
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,858
If I do that,

83
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,945
will I be able to let it go from my heart?

84
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,912
Father, are you really going to stop here?

85
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,998
You must uncover the truth
of Crown Prince Taein's death

86
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,334
to prove that
Brother was poisoned to death.

87
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,129
Even if I wish to reveal the truth,

88
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,381
there is no evidence left to prove it.

89
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,467
The truth is only in words.

90
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,803
What can I do with it?

91
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,851
You have the gajangsacho.

92
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,687
GAJANGSACHO: THE FIRST DRAFT
OF SECRET AFFAIRS AND PERSONAL REMARKS

93
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,153
That only includes
the circumstances of his poisoning.

94
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,198
It is not enough to uncover the truth.

95
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,494
Mother, please step in.

96
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,078
Please persuade Father.

97
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
Crown Prince.

98
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,627
It is not an easy decision
for His Majesty.

99
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,297
If Crown Prince Taein
was poisoned to death,

100
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,258
it denies the legitimacy
of his enthronement.

101
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,636
Also,

102
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,889
he will have to punish his mother,
the Queen Dowager.

103
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,267
It is not an easy decision to make.

104
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,022
Even so, he should not turn
away from the truth.

105
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,735
Yi Ik-hyeon has died,

106
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,446
so without the decision of His Majesty,

107
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,323
it will be

108
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,368
difficult to uncover the truth.

109
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,536
However,

110
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,249
we also cannot let the past
hold us back like this.

111
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,294
We cannot let this tragedy repeat itself.

112
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,340
In that case,
I will think of a way to help Father

113
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,175
come to a decision.

114
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,843
Very well.

115
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,137
All we can do

116
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,516
is pave the way for His Majesty.

117
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,060
Do you think

118
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,729
His Majesty will do as you say again?

119
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,774
The King cannot defy me.

120
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,152
He is the one who is the most afraid

121
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,990
that the truth behind the death
of Crown Prince Taein will be revealed.

122
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,703
In that case,
what should we do about Her Majesty?

123
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:43,374
I am certain she will try to reveal that
Crown Prince Taein was poisoned to death.

124
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,336
If His Majesty changes his mind,

125
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,755
things will get out of hand.

126
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,383
Before that happens,

127
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,262
I will sway the Queen

128
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,724
to bend the King's will.

129
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,727
Do you have a plan?

130
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,104
In order to sway the Queen,

131
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,858
I simply have to reveal
the weaknesses of her children.

132
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,693
We have already

133
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,322
taken measures
with the Crown Princess, have we not?

134
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,079
This medicine is good for heart disease.

135
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,629
It is so bitter.

136
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,048
It is good for you, so please finish it.

137
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,717
If you say so, Your Royal Highness,

138
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,677
I will finish it.

139
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,863
There is no longer a need
for these medicinal herbs.

140
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,076
It seems like the Crown Princess
has lost the fetus in her womb.

141
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,371
Are you certain?

142
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,832
I am certain of her miscarriage.

143
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,001
The stillborn fetus
still remains in her womb,

144
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,128
so it is simply not showing.

145
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,421
In that case,

146
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,882
is there a chance
she will conceive another baby?

147
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,134
The Crown Princess

148
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,012
has heart disease and a slow pulse,

149
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,265
so it will be difficult
for her to conceive again.

150
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,739
My daughter.

151
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,700
You are here.

152
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,001
I rushed here
because I missed my daughter.

153
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,174
A-ra.

154
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,510
Say, "Father."

155
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,554
"Father."

156
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,639
Do you not think her eyes are beautiful?

157
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,892
You took after your mother
and got beautiful eyes.

158
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,562
A-ra.

159
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,507
My Queen, you already knew?

160
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,136
Yes, I did.

161
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,680
Like mother, like son.

162
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,601
Do you have any idea

163
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,270
how grave this matter is?

164
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,730
I do.

165
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,398
Your Majesty.

166
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,235
You must cast out those lowly ones
from the palace.

167
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,363
She is the child of Grand Prince Muan.
Watch what you say, Mother.

168
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,244
Father.

169
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,581
I wish to protect
my child and the woman I love.

170
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,918
I wish to marry Cho-wol.

171
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,632
Marry her?

172
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,762
There is no royalty
who has ever married someone low-born.

173
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,681
Why do the children of the Queen

174
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,309
never abide by
the customs of the royal family

175
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,103
or the laws of this kingdom?

176
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
Father.

177
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,400
If it goes against
the customs of the royal family,

178
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,070
what if I step down as grand prince?

179
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,283
You cannot throw away your position
as you wish.

180
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,037
Then are you telling me to abandon them?

181
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,456
I cannot do that.

182
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,293
Then will you dare
to break the law of the kingdom?

183
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,754
We cannot say that this breaks
the law of the kingdom.

184
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,174
It is just unprecedented.

185
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,968
What did you say?

186
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:08,847
It is just that the royalty has chosen
to take one as a concubine

187
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,808
in situations like this.

188
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,397
With the permission
of Your Majesty and the Queen Dowager,

189
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,942
Grand Prince Muan may become the first

190
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,403
to break with tradition.

191
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,029
Queen!

192
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,242
I will consider it.

193
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,371
You two may leave.

194
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,218
Your Majesty, the matter
with Grand Prince Muan is a problem,

195
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,388
but things are graver
with the Crown Princess.

196
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,516
She is unable to conceive a child.

197
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,226
Will you let her stay?

198
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,978
Your Majesty.

199
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,397
Royal Physician Song is here.

200
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,942
I summoned him here.

201
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,406
Let him in.

202
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,416
Royal Physician Song.

203
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,921
Tell us what you used
for the medicine for the Crown Princess.

204
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,756
I put in goldthread, lilyturf,

205
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,301
and tortoise shells
because they are good for heart disease.

206
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,764
Why did you not include

207
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,891
red ochre and burreed tuber,

208
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,269
the ingredients
the Queen Dowager gave you?

209
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,902
Speak.

210
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,280
With all due respect,

211
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,825
those ingredients could harm
the fetus in her womb,

212
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,869
so I did not include them in her medicine.

213
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,207
How could a physician do such a thing?

214
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,085
How dare you…

215
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,547
How dare you tell such a lie?

216
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,591
My Queen, what is going on?

217
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,135
Is she actually pregnant?

218
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,597
I tried to hide her pregnancy

219
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,891
until she reached a stable period.

220
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,267
I thought

221
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:21,188
it was a way
to protect the child she is with.

222
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,400
As long as she gets enough rest,

223
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,861
I am sure she will deliver
the baby without any problem.

224
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,488
Your Majesty.

225
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,950
Everything they just said
is nothing but a lie.

226
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:37,079
You must trust the words of your mother!

227
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,123
That is enough, Mother!

228
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,182
Court Lady Nam.

229
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,645
Court Lady Nam!

230
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,200
Do you think I will back down like this?

231
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,077
His Majesty,

232
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,371
the deposed Queen Yoon,

233
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,707
and Yi Ik-hyeon

234
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,377
all suffered because of what you did.

235
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,507
So how could you be so brazen?

236
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,134
I am a winner.

237
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,055
They just paid the price for losing.

238
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,599
Do you think

239
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:42,186
the world will change in any way
if you expose the truth?

240
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,025
It may not change.

241
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,196
But I do know

242
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,948
that it will not be the same as before.

243
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,286
If you think the King is on your side,
you are wrong.

244
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,788
The King will never

245
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,750
expose the truth
behind the death of Crown Prince Taein.

246
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,754
If he does, he will have to deny
the legitimacy of his enthronement.

247
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,257
Do you really think he will do that?

248
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,095
I will help him reach

249
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,013
the right decision.

250
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,681
I will stop you!

251
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:26,188
I will never let you reveal the truth
about the death of Crown Prince Taein.

252
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,689
That is

253
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,484
my way of protecting my son!

254
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,821
That is not a way to protect His Majesty
in any way, Queen Dowager!

255
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,575
I will protect my husband

256
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,995
in my own way.

257
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,843
Are you telling me
to testify or something?

258
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,220
Yes.

259
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,305
You risked the life of your son

260
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,475
to expose the poisoning
of Crown Prince Taein for 20 years.

261
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,643
Is it not

262
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,437
because of the guilt
you felt as a physician?

263
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,780
I am a criminal who will be executed soon.

264
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,992
And the autopsy report is gone.

265
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,369
Who would believe the words of a criminal?

266
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,126
There is a gajangsacho

267
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,962
that contains the record of that day.

268
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,259
This will be your last chance

269
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,012
to reveal the truth.

270
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,251
Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk will testify.

271
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,629
That man is a rebel.

272
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,422
Even if he does testify,

273
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,883
who will believe his words?

274
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,428
But you know that his words are true.

275
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,356
It seems like

276
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,525
you still dwell

277
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,779
on that day 20 years ago.

278
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,949
However, I know.

279
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,785
I know how you have lived as the King

280
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,996
to hold your place on the throne.

281
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,000
Even if everything in the past is exposed,

282
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,420
that will never change the fact

283
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,965
that you have been a sage king.

284
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,134
I know that,

285
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,761
and so do the heavens

286
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,431
and the people of your kingdom.

287
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,927
These will prove the poisoning
of the late Crown Prince.

288
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,690
I believe you have the gajangsacho.

289
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,859
How you will use these…

290
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,113
is now entirely up to you.

291
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,036
I request that

292
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,497
you right the wrong of the past
as the King

293
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,209
and record the truth.

294
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,379
Reinstate those who have been wronged

295
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,924
and put down in history
that Crown Prince Taein

296
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,260
and our late Crown Prince were poisoned.

297
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,471
This is…

298
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,850
the last way
I can protect you, Your Majesty,

299
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,939
and the way we can protect
the children our Crown Prince left behind.

300
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,404
It is time…

301
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,950
for you to put down the burden…

302
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,704
and be freed.

303
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,472
Put down in history
that Crown Prince Taein

304
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,933
and our late Crown Prince were poisoned.

305
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,644
This is…

306
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,731
the last way
I can protect you, Your Majesty,

307
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:27,447
and the way we can protect
the children our Crown Prince left behind.

308
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,152
I must reveal the truth.

309
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,241
I will reveal how my brother,
Crown Prince Taein,

310
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,412
died.

311
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,042
My son,

312
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,172
are you going to punish your mother?

313
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,843
Do you have evidence?

314
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,680
What can the gajangsacho

315
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,933
and the autopsy report prove?

316
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,315
I saw everything.

317
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,821
That night,

318
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,824
I saw everything.

319
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,668
I will put an end to this tragedy…

320
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,756
which you have begun.

321
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,472
Everything is in the past, Your Majesty.

322
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,434
Everything is back
in its rightful place now.

323
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,520
For what must you do this?

324
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,857
I can no longer look the other way.

325
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,987
You killed Crown Prince Taein,

326
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,989
and because of that,

327
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,076
my son died.

328
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,619
I do not wish

329
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,956
to see any more sacrifices.

330
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,460
You cannot do this to your mother.

331
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,088
Everything I have done

332
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,674
was for your sake.

333
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,594
Mother.

334
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,682
If you truly wish to do something for me,

335
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,558
then please,

336
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,562
do not do anything at all from now on.

337
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,024
That is the only thing I want…

338
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,904
from you, Mother.

339
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,242
Your Majesty.

340
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,372
Can you…

341
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,582
really…

342
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,713
punish your mother?

343
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,021
Yes.

344
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,900
I must do it as the King.

345
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,963
Your Majesty.

346
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,676
Do not leave.

347
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,770
Your Majesty!

348
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,680
I believe today will be

349
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,933
the last time I come by and greet you.

350
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,604
I thank you…

351
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,567
for looking after my family

352
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,153
to this day.

353
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,914
Here.

354
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,082
Try it.

355
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,591
It is very delicious.

356
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,009
Is it?

357
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,679
Try this kimchi too.

358
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,688
It is good.

359
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,150
Nothing is better than our food.

360
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,655
Yes. No matter what delicacies
we served to envoys from abroad,

361
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,491
they enjoyed this kimchi the most.

362
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,743
They would even take some back with them.

363
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,957
Try this too.

364
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:35,959
Here.

365
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,046
Yi Ik-hyeon

366
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,090
used gansu, salty and bitter water,
to poison the late Crown Prince.

367
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,219
I will reinstate Lady Min,
Yi Han, and Yi Yul-hui,

368
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:14,557
who were deposed after Lady Min was framed
for the murder of the late Crown Prince.

369
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,061
Also,

370
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,564
I could not read the sillok
from the reign of the late King,

371
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,401
but I believe the record
of the death of Crown Prince Taein

372
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,278
is only a single line that says

373
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,114
he died of hyeolheogwol.

374
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,992
Therefore, I wish

375
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,996
to correct the sillok, veritable records,
based on the gajangsacho

376
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,083
written by
Official Historian Park Jung-ho.

377
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,336
Your Majesty.

378
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,965
The sillok of the late King
was written plainly and fairly

379
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,718
without leaning to one side or the other.

380
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,137
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

381
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,806
I cannot do that.

382
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:01,187
I shall also use this chance
to rectify my mistake.

383
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:06,109
However, Your Majesty,
if you unmask an incident of the past,

384
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,195
it will only cause confusion.

385
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,989
Besides,

386
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,242
there is no evidence
that Crown Prince Taein was murdered.

387
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,828
Yoo Sang-uk, the medical examiner
of Crown Prince Taein,

388
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,455
testified to everything
that happened back then.

389
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,208
And I have evidence to prove his poisoning

390
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,087
right here.

391
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,881
Your Majesty.

392
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,509
Please reconsider your royal command.

393
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,888
-Please reconsider your royal command.
-Please reconsider your royal command.

394
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,811
I wish to undo this wrongful knot

395
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,312
and right the wrongs.

396
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,023
Please…

397
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,567
reconsider your decision.

398
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,821
I am afraid your achievements
of the last 20 years

399
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,782
will be disparaged.

400
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,118
I believe my achievements
will be evaluated

401
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,328
by the generations to come.

402
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,858
Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk.

403
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,116
I have a question.

404
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,412
Did you wish to kill my brother too?

405
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,210
I am asking if you were in league
with Yi Ik-hyeon from the start.

406
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,424
Did I not tell you before?

407
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,221
I have lived my life
honoring my pride as a physician.

408
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,645
There was nothing wrong
with my prescription.

409
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,439
That is all.

410
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,984
Be it medicine or power,

411
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,321
everything should be used to save people,

412
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,865
Your Royal Highness.

413
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,326
Please excuse me.

414
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,839
Did it still concern you?

415
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,260
Kang.

416
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,681
You have done enough.

417
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,311
You did well.

418
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,898
Thanks to you,

419
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,694
I could keep my promise to your brother.

420
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,744
It is time for us…

421
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,959
to let him go.

422
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,975
Uncle!

423
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,126
Mother.

424
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,795
Promise me…

425
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,549
that you will remain strong.

426
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,137
Only then will I be able to die in peace.

427
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,891
Do not

428
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,145
worry about anything now.

429
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,774
Rest in peace.

430
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:33,209
I appoint Park Gyeong-u
as the head of the Office of Sillok

431
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,545
and add an appendix
to the sillok of the late King.

432
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,798
Furthermore,

433
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,802
I will reinstate the deposed Queen Yoon,
the mother of Crown Prince Taein.

434
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,430
And the Queen Dowager,
who caused his death,

435
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,642
will be confined to her quarters.

436
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,521
I strictly ban anyone from meeting her

437
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,815
personally.

438
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:02,196
This means he is practically deposing her.

439
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,739
Of course, he is.

440
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,417
Your Royal Highness, it is Court Lady Nam.

441
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,076
First Junior Consort Cho
was crowned as the Queen.

442
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,495
The King announced
the royal title of the Queen

443
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,373
and held her coronation.

444
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,877
But His Majesty passed away the next day,

445
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,131
and the Queen stepped down
from her position after a day.

446
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,592
Your Royal Highness…

447
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,638
Your Royal Highness…

448
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,686
Nobody can punish me.

449
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,648
Your Royal Highness…

450
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,032
Queen Dowager.

451
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,203
Your time has come to an end.

452
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,166
Please be freed
from the vicious cycle of wicked deeds.

453
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,713
This is my last farewell

454
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,635
to my mother-in-law who was wicked

455
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,597
and therefore sometimes pitiable.

456
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,897
3 MONTHS LATER

457
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,202
You look very well.

458
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,721
There will be chinjamrye,
silk farming ceremony, today.

459
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,807
It will begin at the eleventh hour
in the back garden,

460
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,101
so prepare your equipment.

461
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,229
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

462
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,943
I am sorry I am late.

463
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,152
Crown Princess!

464
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,575
Like husband, like wife.

465
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,785
Tell me about it.

466
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,662
She is the last to arrive.

467
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,913
Goodness.

468
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,207
She is pregnant.

469
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,670
Yes, and pregnant ladies
are always sleepy, as you know.

470
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:57,408
I see these buildings every day,

471
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:01,870
but since you are showing me around
the palace, the colors seem different.

472
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,626
Please do not run!

473
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,802
Your Royal Highness.

474
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,888
I always wondered what this was
as I walked by.

475
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,223
What is this?

476
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,475
This is deumeu.

477
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,686
-Deumu?
-Meu.

478
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,688
Deumeu.

479
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,607
Deumeu.

480
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,569
The palace is made of wood,
so it is vulnerable to fire.

481
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,155
It is a symbol to protect us from fire.

482
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,281
A symbol? Why?

483
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,284
The spirit of fire looks so frightening

484
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,077
that when it comes to start a fire,

485
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,456
it sees its own reflection in the deumeu
and flees out of shock.

486
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,168
It does not look frightening.

487
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,586
It is quite handsome.

488
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,259
Your Royal Highness, wait for me!

489
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,262
Your Royal Highness, please do not run.

490
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,648
Should we eat together tomorrow…

491
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,860
and chat a little?

492
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,528
Yes!

493
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,167
LOOKING AROUND THE PALACE HOLDING HIS HAND
TAKING A STROLL WITH HIM

494
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,611
Right.

495
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,155
How did you find the tutors?

496
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,330
The arithmetic tutor was rather lacking.

497
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,585
Then I shall replace that one.

498
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:20,926
Yes, Mother.

499
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,421
Do you still keep an eye on me?

500
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,506
Yes.

501
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,092
I do not trust you.

502
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,220
I will keep my eye on you to the end.

503
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,307
So,

504
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,144
do not give up
and hold out for your mother.

505
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,856
Where are you?

506
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,402
I must go.

507
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,573
Where are you?

508
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,542
I thought you left me.

509
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,256
Why would you think such a thing?

510
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,675
Let us go back inside.

511
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,223
Your hands…

512
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,643
are very warm.

513
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,170
The child of Yi Ik-hyeon is still alive.

514
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,759
I believe my A-ra is a genius.

515
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:52,304
So please share the education methods
of the royal family.

516
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,263
Well.

517
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,974
How about balancing
and blood circulation exercises?

518
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,434
She already finished that.

519
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,437
Then you should begin indusuryeonbeop.

520
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,898
It is a method in which
you read a book out loud and recite it.

521
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,025
It helps with brain development.

522
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,820
By the way, Grand Prince Muan,
it does not feel like you left the palace.

523
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:12,449
She is right. We see you more often
in the palace than before.

524
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,869
You used to say
we coddle our children too much.

525
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,497
You are the worst, Brother.

526
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,210
I am also a parent, after all.

527
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,962
I hope you continue to guide me.

528
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,299
Grand Prince Muan
practically lives in the palace.

529
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,052
Why do you always leave
after meeting the Crown Prince?

530
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,389
I visit His Royal Highness
for official business.

531
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,808
To discuss a reformation
of the Righteous Granaries.

532
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,685
But still.

533
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,478
I will forget your face at this rate.

534
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,731
It is against the customs
for a prince who left the palace

535
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,358
to return for personal reasons.

536
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,902
You always have something to say.

537
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,616
From now on, I will visit you

538
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,785
after I meet His Royal Highness.

539
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,453
Really?

540
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:00,914
Yes.

541
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,339
Prince Bogeom, wait for me.

542
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,594
What is this book?

543
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,929
What do you think?

544
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,305
The secret to pregnancy.

545
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,727
I asked the nursemaid
who helped the Crown Princess

546
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,437
to share it with me.

547
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,524
In two days,
the moon will be full at midnight.

548
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,776
That is the best time for consummation.

549
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,319
Mother.

550
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,865
These are deer antlers and root bark

551
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,658
to help with energy and blood flow.

552
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,326
You can take them with your wife

553
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,661
three times a day.

554
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,496
I will not take them.

555
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,623
Why not?

556
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,210
I do not need these things.

557
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,087
Prince Simso.

558
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,923
I prepared them for you. Try them for me.

559
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,509
She is…

560
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,386
already pregnant.

561
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,058
Goodness!

562
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,060
This is great news.

563
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,815
In that case,
I will help raise your child.

564
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,735
Mother.

565
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:15,197
I will raise my child on my own.

566
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,282
Prince Simso, let me help you.

567
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,951
-You should return.
-Prince Simso.

568
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,662
I have learned my lesson,
so I will be a good grandmother.

569
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,581
Give me another chance.

570
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,047
Prince Hodong.

571
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,548
Why are you running?

572
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,091
You will grow hungry.

573
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,475
Mother, I made a resolution today.

574
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,268
I decided

575
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,646
to lose weight.

576
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,899
Why? You are perfect right now.

577
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:54,820
I want to become tall
and handsome like my brothers.

578
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,615
Goodness.

579
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,827
All of this
will help you grow taller later.

580
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,789
I am sure you will grow
as tall as the Crown Prince.

581
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,959
-Really?
-Of course.

582
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,046
And in my eyes, you are
the most handsome prince of them all.

583
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,006
Mother.

584
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,716
I am hungry after running.

585
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,679
Very well. Let us go eat some meat.

586
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,639
You can leave it there.

587
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,309
-Goodness.
-That is for here.

588
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,228
Right here.

589
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:33,358
What is this place?

590
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,528
A place where women who have
nowhere to go get back on their feet.

591
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,366
Such a place exists?

592
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,367
Yes.

593
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:46,121
Crown Princess, from now on,
please work with me

594
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,123
and become their shield.

595
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,417
Yes.

596
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,379
You are here.

597
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,798
Please show the Crown Princess
around Hyewolgak.

598
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,091
Yes, Your Majesty.

599
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,759
Please come this way.

600
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,233
I have already meddled with your life.

601
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,076
Please accept this.

602
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,830
I always wanted to repay
your kindness, Your Majesty.

603
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,008
It is very beautiful.

604
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:46,139
I will put this in my bedchamber
and use it for flowers.

605
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,266
Whenever I see the flowers,

606
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,185
I will think of you.

607
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,579
Brother.

608
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,625
Between a shield kite
and a ray kite, which one flies higher?

609
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,629
A shield kite, probably.

610
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:21,383
It does not have a tail, but it can fly
regardless of the direction of the wind.

611
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:24,094
I see. Let us fly one together next time.

612
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,887
We shall.

613
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,682
There is this kite
I have been studying intensively.

614
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,564
By the way, Grand Prince Gyeseong,

615
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:41,152
why are birds in your paintings
always on the branches and not flying?

616
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:47,826
He is right.

617
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,161
Why are their wings all folded?

618
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,685
Brother, it is today.

619
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,395
Are you certain?

620
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,856
I just checked
at the Royal Astronomical Observatory.

621
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,066
-What time will it begin?
-Right after your evening lesson.

622
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,569
It will end in an instant,
so you must run.

623
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,700
Crown Princess.

624
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,326
-Come with me now.
-Pardon?

625
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,928
A shooting star!

626
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,182
Do not look at me.

627
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,558
Make your wish.

628
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,910
What did you wish for,
Your Royal Highness?

629
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,036
It is a secret.

630
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,168
Crown Princess.

631
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,837
Did all of your wishes come true?

632
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,549
It is a secret.

633
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,902
Why did you say nothing happened
on our consummation night?

634
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,239
Because you did not seem to remember.

635
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,826
I remember.

636
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,352
Go on.

637
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,576
It is nice to have tea with you.

638
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:40,999
I have more time now,
so stop by more often.

639
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,710
Mother.

640
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,382
I wish to leave the palace.

641
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,388
I wish to see a new world.

642
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:04,939
Hwan.

643
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,319
Why are you suddenly saying this?

644
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,448
The day you took me

645
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,992
beyond the palace walls…

646
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,997
was the happiest day of my life.

647
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,292
The moment…

648
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,254
I saw myself in the portrait,

649
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:33,134
I felt like I was allowed to be myself
for the first time in my life.

650
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,016
Hwan.

651
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,522
How could I ever be at ease without you?

652
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,108
Please consider

653
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,779
my wishes to keep you by my side.

654
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,626
Mother.

655
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,257
I cannot hide behind you forever.

656
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,595
I wish to truly live as myself.

657
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,224
I have

658
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,477
lived all my life within the palace.

659
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:28,064
There is still an entire world out there
that I wish to face.

660
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,654
Please do not worry too much.

661
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,407
I must take care of myself now.

662
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,129
You can let go of my hand now,

663
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,881
Mother.

664
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,094
My dear son.

665
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,766
You are all grown up.

666
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:25,204
Let me give you
the portable sundial I developed.

667
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,374
I can always make another one.

668
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,754
I included a compass with it too,

669
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,673
so it will be quite useful as you travel.

670
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,432
Thank you, Grand Prince Ilyeong.

671
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,810
Stay healthy.

672
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,395
Eat well,

673
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,564
and do not be ill.

674
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,482
Hey.

675
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,152
Why do you say goodbye
as if you will never return?

676
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,906
Brother, just take a boat
and come to see us once every year.

677
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,115
You will do that, right?

678
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,398
Go now.

679
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,066
It is hot.

680
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,568
Why? It is warm.

681
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:41,698
Go.

682
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,517
Do not look back.

683
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,133
Uncle.

684
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,344
Where are you?

685
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:27,970
Uncle.

686
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,514
Where are you?

687
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,519
I cannot see!

688
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,146
I wish to have a son.

689
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,151
When I saw the shooting star,
I made a wish.

690
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:45,822
I wished for a son
who looks exactly like His Royal Highness.

691
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,825
Then your wish will come true.

692
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,912
-I do not know yet.
-Pardon?

693
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,957
His Royal Highness

694
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,418
wished for a daughter
who looks exactly like me.

695
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,505
We will soon find out

696
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,131
whose wish will come true.

697
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,176
I am sure he will be a boy.

698
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,971
My wish was more earnest.

699
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,113
It looks great on you.

700
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:37,415
Your Royal Highness,
please protect this palace.

701
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,542
I will protect

702
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,918
your kingdom.

703
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,667
Your Majesty!

704
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,212
Your Majesty.

705
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,214
Grand Prince Ilyeong went up on the roof

706
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,883
in an attempt to fly again.

707
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,468
Again?

708
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:32,720
Goodness, that brat.

709
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,222
Which roof?

710
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,567
Brother, this is dangerous.

711
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,361
I have prepared it thoroughly.

712
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,072
I am sure I will fly today.

713
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,659
Your Majesty!

714
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,994
Please slow down!

715
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,537
Please slow down!

716
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,289
The mother of the kingdom? Nonsense.

717
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:03,084
Life as the Queen is extremely hard.

718
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:56,947
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

719
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:00,242
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

720
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:45,222
