00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,792
EPISODE 4

3
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,945
Mother was definitely coming from
the direction of the burning chamber.

4
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,918
Let Mother know that I am here.

5
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,254
I apologize,
but Her Majesty is not in her chamber.

6
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,883
I will inform her of your visit
once she returns.

7
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,176
Your Highness!

8
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,344
Your Highness.

9
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,222
Your Highness.

10
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,979
Your Highness.

11
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,397
No, you cannot go…

12
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,161
Why is His Royal Highness here?

13
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,375
What is he being treated for?

14
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,045
Answer me.

15
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,547
I shall give you the answer.

16
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,434
Why is he in your quarters
instead of at the hot spring?

17
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,354
I heard he left
to treat his skin condition.

18
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,316
Officially, he did.

19
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,988
I plan on notifying His Majesty
as soon as he gets better.

20
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,742
So Father does not know this either?

21
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,288
What is his condition?
Why do you go so far as to hide it?

22
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,843
Hyeolheogwol.

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,471
Crown Prince Taein
also suffered from this disease.

24
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,478
Are you saying Brother may pass away?

25
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,439
Yes.

26
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,817
As you said, Crown Prince Taein
died of hyeolheogwol.

27
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,278
That is what everyone believes.

28
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,115
However, the mother of
Crown Prince Taein said

29
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,660
that the disease was not what killed him.

30
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,874
That is what she would like to believe.

31
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,127
I felt the same way.

32
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:39,052
So I searched for
the records of Naeuiwon, the Royal Clinic.

33
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,553
But…

34
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,223
the records were destroyed in a fire.

35
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,391
Nothing was left behind.

36
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,727
That is not all.

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,731
Not a single person
who was involved is alive.

38
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,651
So I thought

39
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,738
the Crown Prince may be further endangered
if I made a rash move.

40
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,532
That is why I could not tell you.

41
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,244
But what if his condition worsens

42
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,788
after missing
the most ideal period of treatment?

43
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,041
No parent would do anything
to harm their child.

44
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,544
I cannot explain everything to you,

45
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,048
but this was

46
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,095
the best decision I could make
to protect your brother.

47
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,475
Then did you also start the fire…

48
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,105
to protect Grand Prince Gyeseong?

49
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,027
I am asking if that was
the best decision you could make.

50
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,124
Yes.

51
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,044
It was the best I could do.

52
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:04,429
Then did I grow up alone
outside of the palace when I was young

53
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,642
because you made that decision
for my sake?

54
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,278
You were taken from me
as soon as I gave birth to you.

55
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,116
I was too young back then.

56
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,287
I thought that was the only way

57
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,583
to keep you alive.

58
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,801
I understand.

59
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,014
Please tell me about that
when the time is right.

60
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,225
For now, please focus on treating Brother.

61
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,480
I will.

62
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,148
Would you like a drink?

63
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,205
Brother, I decided
not to take the second exam.

64
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,418
I pondered a while to reach this decision,
so please do understand.

65
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,213
You do not need my understanding.

66
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,924
But you should obtain Mother's permission.

67
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,093
She expected the most out of you.

68
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,763
Mother is the one who suggested it first.

69
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,392
I wish to ask you
to do your best for me too.

70
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,729
You are now the only child
Mother can count on.

71
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,483
I am sorry to put the burden on you.

72
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,945
No one expects anything of me.
It is not a burden.

73
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:28,906
By the way,

74
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,076
were you with Mother?

75
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,538
That is a secret between Mother and me,

76
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,498
so do not ask.

77
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,858
-How can I help you?
-I want to find someone.

78
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,737
The price depends on the person.

79
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,697
There is a disease called hyeolheogwol.

80
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,449
I want to find
a physician who can treat it.

81
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,450
You have two days.

82
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,703
You should go to the dispensary.

83
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,163
Why are you here asking…

84
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,375
I did, but I could not find one.
That is why I came to you.

85
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,171
If you can pay good money,
we can find you anyone but His Majesty.

86
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,841
But I think it will cost quite a lot
for what you are requesting.

87
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,428
Why are you doing this?

88
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,139
To draw your sword
for a bit of overpricing…

89
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,229
Is this enough?

90
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,235
Did you say we have two days to find him?

91
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,585
Your Majesty, I hear
Royal Physician Cho Guk-yeong is back.

92
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,129
Would you like to meet him?

93
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,050
I should.

94
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,055
No, forget it.

95
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,768
He was also…

96
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,772
one of the royal physicians
for Crown Prince Taein.

97
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,735
But he rose to the rank of dangsanggwan,
a minister-level official.

98
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,489
Other royal physicians
were either exiled or killed.

99
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,243
while this man climbed the ladder.

100
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,787
Is it not odd?

101
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,081
But Your Majesty,

102
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:46,377
His Royal Highness is not showing
any improvements.

103
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,922
Consulting Royal Physician Cho
for treatment

104
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,716
is the best you can do right now.

105
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,389
Yet I cannot consult him.

106
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,142
Your Majesty,
Court Lady Oh at your service.

107
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,185
What is it?

108
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,900
Are you suggesting that the Crown Prince
return to the palace?

109
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,029
Yes, Royal Physician Cho
has returned to the palace,

110
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,489
so let him take charge
of treating his skin disease.

111
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,368
The Crown Princess will give birth soon,
so tell him to return quickly.

112
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,665
Yes, Your Majesty. I will do that.

113
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,876
No, Your Majesty.

114
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,421
He is not well enough
to make an official appearance.

115
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:34,634
Once the Crown Princess gives birth,
he will have no choice but to appear.

116
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,428
It will be a problem
if he does not come to her delivery,

117
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,430
but if he shows up in this condition,

118
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,224
all will be able to see
how ill His Royal Highness is.

119
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,394
We do not know what may happen next.

120
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,066
I am sure there is someone who assisted

121
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,027
Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk
or worked as a female physician.

122
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,821
It can be anyone who was involved
with the Royal Clinic back then.

123
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,865
Hurry and find them. This is urgent.

124
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,325
Yes, Your Majesty.

125
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,959
Did you prescribe cheongeumnurotang
to His Majesty?

126
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,086
Yes.

127
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,672
It was prescribed
because he had yeoljeung.

128
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,589
I see.

129
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
YEOLJEUNG: SEVERE ILLNESS
WITH A VERY HIGH FEVER

130
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,387
Why are you here?

131
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,305
Pardon?

132
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,517
I heard His Royal Highness is away
from the palace due to his skin disease.

133
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,895
You are his physician,
so why are you in the palace?

134
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,439
His Royal Highness wished to leave

135
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,943
only with his eunuch
as he only had itching symptoms.

136
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,278
His Majesty also gave him permission.

137
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,405
Is that so?

138
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,782
But while I was gone,

139
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,036
I saw a record of your prescription
of ginseng extract to him.

140
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,955
Did he…

141
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,417
show signs of
blood deficiency and fatigue?

142
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,920
No, sire.

143
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,382
The medicine was prescribed
for his headache and signs of anemia.

144
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,677
He has gotten better
after taking the medicine.

145
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,016
The Crown Princess
will deliver in 15 days.

146
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,895
You will take turns
doing night duty starting today.

147
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,106
-Yes, Sire.
-Yes, Sire.

148
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,078
By the way, why did you live
outside of the palace until you were ten?

149
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,423
You were quite young back then.
Do you remember that?

150
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,885
Of course I do.
I suddenly got an older brother.

151
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,762
What was the reason?

152
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,515
I am not sure.

153
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,350
I do not know either.

154
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,644
Are you not curious?

155
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,653
Do not be curious
and do not try to find out.

156
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,163
Where is Eunuch Kim?

157
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,960
He tried to find out something
he did not need to know,

158
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,088
so I sent him far away.

159
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,385
I cannot sleep without Eunuch Kim around.

160
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,722
The palace is too big,

161
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,808
and it is too scary at night.

162
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,977
So why were you curious?

163
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,649
Your useless curiosity did this to him.

164
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,446
You should become used to the palace.
This will be your home from now on.

165
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,201
In the palace,

166
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,664
turn a blind eye to things you see,
forget things you hear,

167
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,876
and if there is something you wish to say,
keep your mouth shut.

168
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,964
Good boy.

169
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:05,302
Swallow it down, be it tears or curiosity…

170
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,518
if you wish to protect
what is precious to you.

171
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,147
Brother.

172
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,567
Are you not going to tell me?

173
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,492
Stop minding my story.
Do not be curious either.

174
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,084
You lucky little brat.

175
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,003
Hey, get up.

176
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,713
Why?

177
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,300
I am here killing myself studying
to become the cohort of the Crown Prince.

178
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,975
I cannot go out,

179
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,519
and I have nothing better to do,
so I just got bored.

180
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,688
You have things to do.

181
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,066
Read out the important parts to me.

182
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,026
Pardon?

183
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,322
Start reading.

184
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:12,161
I wish to conduct the second exam
through a debate

185
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:16,457
and the total score will be calculated
based on their aggregate scores.

186
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,375
Your Majesty.

187
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,504
Passing the first examination
already proved their excellent knowledge.

188
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,342
We held the first examination
to pick out the princes with high scores.

189
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,638
It is only proper to evaluate them
solely based on the second examination.

190
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,556
I agree that the princes already proved

191
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,143
their level of knowledge
through the first examination.

192
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,688
However, if the second exam
is conducted through a debate,

193
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,982
it will be difficult
to evaluate them objectively.

194
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:42,942
Also,

195
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,570
the personal feelings of the evaluator
may be reflected in their scores.

196
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,364
In order to evaluate them fairly,

197
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,742
it will be appropriate to add the scores
from the first examination.

198
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,915
Your Majesty, you initially decided
not to add the scores of the first exam.

199
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,292
It is only proper you decide

200
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,462
on the evaluation process and methods
after a discussion with us--

201
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,756
This is proper, that is proper!

202
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,801
I am simply trying to select a cohort.

203
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,805
How is it that I am not allowed to change
such minor things according to my will?

204
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,850
You can discuss
and decide on a few topics.

205
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:21,105
I will pick one
and make the final decision.

206
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,067
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

207
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,655
It seems like His Majesty is forgetting
who put him on the throne.

208
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,240
I agree with you.

209
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,201
He has become quite opinionated lately.

210
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,079
At this rate, His Majesty
may select a cohort as he pleases.

211
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,957
No matter how dogmatic he acts,

212
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,835
in the end, we have the final say.

213
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,838
The tutors of the Crown Prince

214
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,299
evaluate and decide
on the cohort of the Crown Prince.

215
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,053
What brings you here,
Chief State Councilor?

216
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:59,518
All eyes in the palace are on the
selection of the Crown Prince's cohort.

217
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,272
But His Majesty said
he was "simply" trying to find a cohort.

218
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,984
Then I heard something

219
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,404
you passed on through my daughter.

220
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,490
There seems to be a problem
with the Crown Prince.

221
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,871
In that case, I do not think
this will simply be a cohort.

222
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,376
I came to confirm with you
if my thoughts were correct.

223
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,379
You came for a confirmation?

224
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,052
I used to be able to tell
what you had on your mind

225
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,887
when I looked at you.

226
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:40,559
But it has now become quite blurry,
so it is impossible for me to tell.

227
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,733
I guess you have gotten old.
Your discernment has become cloudy.

228
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:53,947
You came to a remote corner of the palace
to discuss the issue of a mere cohort.

229
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,658
When one seeks something,

230
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,621
even a woman will leave the palace
to meet someone late at night.

231
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,540
So what is to stop me from visiting
the quarters of the Queen Dowager?

232
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,636
20 YEARS AGO

233
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,639
Please proceed with the taekhyeon.

234
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,229
His Royal Highness
is still alive and well.

235
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,482
Why are you already thinking
of the next Crown Prince selection?

236
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,612
This can become a plot of treason,
First Junior Consort Cho.

237
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,615
When treason succeeds,

238
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,618
it can also turn into history.

239
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:47,709
If something happens to the Crown Prince,

240
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,755
then will you promise

241
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,174
to proceed with the taekhyeon?

242
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,725
Taekhyeon…

243
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,730
Then what do I get from this?

244
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,317
You will become the chief state councilor
and oversee everything.

245
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,280
So you should be
the father of the Queen, should you not?

246
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,448
The father of the Queen?

247
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,422
Do you know
why I accepted your offer back then?

248
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,634
Because you and I both wanted Joseon

249
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,761
to be a strong kingdom.

250
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,056
Therefore, I would like to ask you this.

251
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,685
Will this selection simply decide
on the cohort of the Crown Prince

252
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,022
or is this a step to strengthen
and bring prosperity to this nation?

253
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,940
Chief State Councilor.

254
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,736
If you go on any further,
your words can become treason.

255
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,739
I am making history,
not committing treason.

256
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,910
You and His Majesty are proving this.

257
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,288
What is it that you want?

258
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,792
Just as I helped you then,

259
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,755
I need you to help me this time.

260
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,551
How shall I help you?

261
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,555
I need you to fully support
Prince Uiseong.

262
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,520
Please mobilize your people,
Your Royal Highness.

263
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,619
Prince Bogeom.

264
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,300
Greet him. He is here
as your geobyeok, expert scribe.

265
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,345
It is nice to meet you.
My name is Bae Do-hun.

266
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,181
GEOBYEOK: AN EXPERT WHO WRITES
OR PROVIDES ANSWERS IN AN EXAM

267
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,063
Deputy Minister
of the Ministry of Justice.

268
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,191
I believe you also hold office
as the tutor of the Crown Prince.

269
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:21,905
Is it not your duty as a tutor to educate
and teach the Crown Prince the proper way?

270
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,368
Yes, you are correct.

271
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:31,873
But you came this late at night
to teach me the corrupt way?

272
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,252
-Pardon?
-Also, Deputy Minister,

273
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,921
are you not involved
in the selection of the cohort?

274
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,259
So is it allowed for you
to contact me in private like this?

275
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,720
Well, that is…

276
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:53,186
If you do not follow the rules
and take makeshift measures, you fail.

277
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,690
I do not wish to cheat
and violate the rules.

278
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,275
So please leave.

279
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,362
I apologize.

280
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,698
Oh, my.

281
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,993
Wait. Goodness.

282
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,244
Wait a moment.

283
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,207
Goodness, Prince Bogeom!

284
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,585
Do not ever do anything like this again.

285
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,879
I am not trying to become
the cohort of the Crown Prince.

286
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,715
I just want to put my studies
and abilities to the test

287
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,386
on my own, without help from anyone.

288
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,038
Mother.

289
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,583
Why are you up?

290
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,212
-Is too bright?
-No.

291
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,715
Those are…

292
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,970
-books on medicine, are they not?
-Yes.

293
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,560
I was reading them to know
more about that darned disease.

294
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,648
I need to know what in the world
this thing is that is torturing my child.

295
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,944
But the terminology is too difficult.

296
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,780
Mother.

297
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,409
I am sorry I could not recover faster.

298
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,706
I feel guilty every night,
as though I am an undutiful child.

299
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,210
I would like you to return
to your bedchamber

300
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,129
and sleep in peace tonight.

301
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,757
I am fine.

302
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,467
This is not hard.

303
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,012
I am not tired at all.

304
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,104
Mother.

305
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,775
-I am getting very sleepy.
-Very well.

306
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,235
Oh, my goodness.

307
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,237
Is that the famous Sigangwon?

308
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,199
Is it just me

309
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,452
or does it look
more magnificent than Jonghak?

310
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,496
Please lower your voice.

311
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,165
Why?

312
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:04,044
I am just marveled that my son is
here at a place only for the Crown Prince.

313
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,965
Just do as you prepared.

314
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,550
Make sure you stay calm.

315
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,052
I will not lose.

316
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,762
Not even by a word.

317
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,891
Where are Her Majesty
and the Grand Princes?

318
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,853
Have you not heard?
Prince Gyeseong withdrew this morning.

319
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,231
Then only Grand Prince Seongnam remains?

320
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,863
Mother.

321
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,991
Why are you here
when Brother is still ill?

322
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,078
I should still attend.

323
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,383
Do not feel burdened.

324
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,510
Brother.

325
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,888
Are there really all kinds of things
in the market outside the palace?

326
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,682
That place is another world.

327
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,893
Are we really going to be all right?

328
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,312
We were eliminated, so who cares?

329
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,440
What if we get caught?

330
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,151
Everyone is busy with the second exam,

331
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,279
so no one will notice even if we go out.

332
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,982
BOKSI: SECOND EXAMINATION
OF COHORT SELECTION

333
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,493
These are the topics
we submitted to His Majesty.

334
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,912
One of these will become the debate topic,

335
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,333
so prepare a manuscript,
then memorize it thoroughly.

336
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,252
I looked over the topics
turned in by the Royal Court,

337
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,004
but I will not choose from them.

338
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,883
Bring them.

339
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:24,392
These appeals are all related
to the new plague and hut villages.

340
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,231
I wish to discuss
the problem of the hut village in Seochon,

341
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,818
the main issue these days,
with my princes today.

342
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:38,114
And this one.
His Majesty may change the topic,

343
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,657
so we must be prepared.

344
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,535
We did not include the most timely issues

345
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,705
such as the plague
and the hut village among the topics.

346
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,791
Did you leave them out on purpose?

347
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,835
Prince Uiseong must be
given the most advantages

348
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,754
to stand out all alone.

349
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:57,384
I will also be able to avoid the scandal
of leaking the exam topic.

350
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,386
These are manuscripts
related to the topic.

351
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:03,139
Even the Queen Dowager is on our side.
If he does not make a big mistake,

352
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,809
Prince Uiseong will become
the cohort of the Crown Prince.

353
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,811
In Seochon,

354
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,980
a highly infectious new plague
began to spread.

355
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:20,115
Thankfully, the capital sealed off
the hut village where the plague began

356
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,200
and stopped the spread.

357
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,204
After that, other cases
that sporadically occurred

358
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,997
were quarantined in the hut village.

359
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,509
The hut village will stay sealed off

360
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,678
until the plague is over.

361
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,392
Goodness, it is killing me.

362
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:51,020
Consider these and discuss ways
to stop the spread of the plague

363
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:55,692
as well as to keep the hut village
controlled and under quarantine.

364
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:02,365
The key issue is how severely
the hut village should be quarantined.

365
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,286
They must be strictly separated
and severed from the outside world.

366
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,914
But the patients must be divided
according to the severity of symptoms,

367
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,334
and those who have fully recovered
shall be released from quarantine.

368
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,502
I disagree.

369
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,841
When the plague first spread,
there were no distinct symptoms,

370
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:24,262
so some thought they recovered,
but there were 32 cases of relapses.

371
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,600
Therefore, if we release
patients who do not show any symptoms,

372
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,436
the plague might spread
all over the capital.

373
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,857
Prince Uiseong supports his argument
by using specific examples.

374
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,944
Hence, any contact
with the sick should be prevented

375
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,738
and providing relief
shall also be stopped.

376
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,906
Are you insane?

377
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,119
Are you saying
they should starve to death?

378
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,125
His Majesty is present.
One should watch what they say.

379
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,544
They only held out until now
because of the relief.

380
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,297
We must also provide guryo.

381
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,423
GURYO: MEDICAL SUPPORT

382
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,176
If ending the plague
is the way to protect the capital,

383
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,470
we must kill the plague, not the people.

384
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,597
They received relief
without medical support

385
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,100
because it is impossible to avoid
coming in close contact.

386
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,228
If physicians had access

387
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,563
to the source of the plague
to treat a few people,

388
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,608
the plague could end up
spreading into the capital.

389
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,821
There is a way to end this plague.

390
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,867
We can eradicate it
just as we eradicate blight.

391
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,703
When trees are infected,

392
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,916
the branches that cannot be saved
are cut off and burnt up.

393
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,751
Are you saying
we should set the village on fire?

394
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,169
Yes, we must burn it down.

395
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,672
Then what about the people who live there?

396
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,759
Most of them are immigrants
of unknown ancestry anyway.

397
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,720
What if the plague does not end

398
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,557
even after you kill
innocent people with fire?

399
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,021
Grand Prince Seongnam
is too emotional, rather than rational.

400
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,776
People call this plague virusu.

401
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,198
It means the plague reaches them
like water drops in the fog by the wind.

402
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:12,078
They do not know how they were infected,
so they began to believe

403
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,415
they were infected by the wind, water,
and even invisible air.

404
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:21,504
Such false information
and ignorance about the plague

405
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,592
are what makes the people
frightened and anxious.

406
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,596
-The anxiety has grown
-This is where it began.

407
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,306
which caused the Hut Village Arson Case.

408
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,934
We will be infected
when the disease reach us by the wind.

409
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,563
I hear the disease from the hut village
will flow into the capital.

410
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:42,358
Once we burn them all,
virusu will be destroyed too.

411
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,613
-Come quickly.
-Hurry.

412
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,947
Oh, no.

413
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,699
-What happened?
-Oh, no.

414
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,867
-Fire!
-No!

415
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,535
-Help!
-Such anxiety and fear become hatred

416
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,580
-and the villagers face discrimination.
-There is a child in there.

417
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,206
Please help us.

418
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,959
I brought water!

419
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,842
-Thank you.
-Those who are unrelated to the plague

420
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,470
-She is from the hut village.
-also suffer from violence.

421
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,348
-You started the plague.
-Curse you!

422
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,433
-Die!
-It is your fault!

423
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,645
Their fear of this unknown disease

424
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,229
is the cause of such behavior.

425
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,859
It is important to stop the spread,
but we must know what the plague is.

426
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,611
I agree.

427
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,530
We must take this plague
as a dangerous opportunity

428
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,240
to prepare for the next.

429
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,411
Unless your plan is to burn the people
whenever a plague breaks out,

430
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,082
we must investigate how the disease spread
with medical support.

431
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,794
That is the only way
to stop this anxiety and chaos.

432
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:17,161
Your Majesty,
the second examination has just ended.

433
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,454
I see.

434
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,582
Grand Prince Seongnam must be tired.

435
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,918
Where is he right now?

436
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,836
Well…

437
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:29,424
I do not see him anywhere. He is not
in his quarters or the training site.

438
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,344
Perhaps…

439
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,180
he went to see his brothers.

440
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,166
Where did he go?

441
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,810
Where are these brats?

442
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,593
My brothers.

443
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,471
If you passed the first exam,
you would not have seen this.

444
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,140
I was disappointed that I failed,

445
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,392
but I feel much better now.

446
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,480
Then you can stay here.

447
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,481
Where are you going?

448
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,567
When a man comes out of the palace,

449
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,861
he should at least have
a touch of a woman.

450
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,200
Cho-wol! Open the door.

451
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,576
Please leave.

452
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,704
I promised your mother
that I would never see you again.

453
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,249
That is a promise you made to my mother.

454
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,459
Why should I keep that promise?

455
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,546
If you come for me again,
I will leave this place forever.

456
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,005
Cho-wol.

457
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,967
Young master, you shall stop.

458
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,262
You look cultured enough to understand,
yet you do not.

459
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,347
Who are you?

460
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,600
Cho-wol is my woman.

461
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,146
So you need to leave.

462
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,898
She does not want to see you.

463
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,763
Oh, my.

464
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,766
-She just slapped him.
-How dare you call me your woman?

465
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:27,768
Oh, my.

466
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,521
-Goodness.
-She slapped him again.

467
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,899
Why did you slap me again?

468
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:37,445
Consider that the price
for daring to put your hands on him.

469
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,160
Hyeolheogwol is not
such an ordinary disease.

470
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,954
If you failed to find someone,
give me my money, not an excuse.

471
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,332
What do you mean? I found someone.

472
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,085
I am just saying
it was really not easy to find him.

473
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,798
That is the balance I promised.

474
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,927
What about the physician?

475
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,849
I looked through the entire capital
and found just one person.

476
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,770
But you cannot meet him.

477
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,570
Only crows come and go
to nibble on dead bodies.

478
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,530
People cannot come out of there alive.

479
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,617
I know Seochon like the palm of my hand.

480
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,910
Just let me go in.

481
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,705
I will pay you more for the danger
and for your travel.

482
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,337
Goodness, good work, officers.

483
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,423
-What is it?
-Relief.

484
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,593
-At this hour?
-We are simply told what to do.

485
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,136
We do not have any choice.

486
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,908
Goodness.
You do not have to be so thorough.

487
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,285
Take that.

488
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,457
Let them in.

489
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,920
Leave the cart inside
and come out right away.

490
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,130
Yes, sire.

491
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,667
He is called Master Toji.

492
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,962
You can easily recognize him
by a scar on his chin.

493
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,299
Are you Master Toji?

494
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,144
Leave. I do not have any business
with those who are healthy.

495
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,190
Master, I heard you cured hyeolheogwol.

496
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,860
My brother is severely ill
with that disease.

497
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,031
Master, can you at least tell me
how to treat it?

498
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,159
Goodness, you are one noisy brat.

499
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,329
Is it bad? You should have brought him
on your back.

500
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,332
-Do not give him any cold water.
-Understood.

501
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,168
You are not the only one in a hurry.

502
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,838
Can you not see these urgent patients?

503
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,048
Stop distracting me and get lost.

504
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,592
Goodness. Wait.

505
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,222
How did you get in here?

506
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,559
You must be out of your mind.

507
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,521
Get out of here now unless
you want to die before your brother.

508
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,231
You lunatic.

509
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,279
Goodness gracious.

510
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,366
Here. What is wrong?

511
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,160
Is anyone… Goodness.

512
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,454
You, healthy man, come here.

513
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,917
Healthy man, you.
You are the only one. Come here.

514
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,753
Lift him.

515
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,511
He has not even eaten for three days.

516
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,389
-Bring me the acupuncture case.
-Pardon?

517
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,975
Bring my acupuncture needles.
Over there. Hurry.

518
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,897
Good.

519
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,361
-So how is he doing?
-Pardon?

520
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,742
Your brother. What is his condition?

521
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,328
No, do not bother.

522
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,371
If you came all the way here,

523
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,500
then I am sure he faints often.

524
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,502
Which medicine is he taking?

525
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,670
Doksamtang and gwibitang.

526
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,299
He gets acupuncture treatments too,
but he is not getting better.

527
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,807
I wrote down his symptoms and condition.

528
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,768
Open it.

529
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,854
Let me see.

530
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,859
Did you write this?

531
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,781
It looks like you have read
a few medical manuscripts.

532
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,907
Forget it. Put it away.

533
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:22,873
Has your brother ever lost a lot of blood
after getting hurt?

534
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,250
That has never happened.

535
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,962
But since he was a child,
it took a long time to stop his bleeding.

536
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,672
That symptom has worsened now.

537
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,218
Yet he is receiving
acupuncture treatment, correct?

538
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,680
Those cursed quacks.

539
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:43,143
Those so weak that they faint often
should never be treated with acupuncture.

540
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:47,523
Especially for someone like your brother
whose bleeding does not stop easily.

541
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,193
If he received something like phlebotomy,

542
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,404
then he would die.

543
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,530
Understand?

544
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,949
Then what should we do?

545
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,910
What do you mean?
Do not put needles on him.

546
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,540
Tell them to wait
until his acupuncture points are stable.

547
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,919
Try this and see how it goes.

548
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,839
You can find the herbs written there

549
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,342
at the dispensary near the end
of the market to your right.

550
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,844
It must be that place.

551
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,096
Let me tell you once again.

552
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:23,475
Your brother's condition can get better
just by ceasing acupuncture treatment.

553
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,435
Remember that.

554
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,562
Thank you.

555
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,732
Wait.

556
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,320
I took time out of my busy schedule
and wrote you a prescription.

557
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,113
But, "Thank you"?

558
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,865
No money?

559
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,993
Unbelievable.

560
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,579
How much do I owe you?

561
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,084
Yes, this is enough.

562
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,670
I need money to pay for the medicine.

563
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,839
-You cannot take it all.
-It is included.

564
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,549
Show them the prescription,

565
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,135
say Master Toji sent you,
and they will give it to you.

566
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,471
That is how things work here.
Do not worry. Go now.

567
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:06,226
Before you leave, disinfect your hands
with rice wine by the entrance.

568
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,938
Do not drink it. Wash your hands.

569
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,068
Hey.

570
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,572
I wonder how he will get out of here.

571
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,739
We do not sell these to just anyone.

572
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,658
Who sent you here?

573
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,452
Goodness, you are here.

574
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,661
Greetings.

575
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,913
-This way.
-We have it ready. This way, please.

576
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,543
Who sent you here again?

577
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,212
-Master Toji sent me here.
-Master Toji.

578
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,714
You owe me 15 nyang.

579
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,591
I already paid him for the medicine.

580
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,343
Goodness, he got you too.

581
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,763
You must pay the dispensary for medicine,
not the physician.

582
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,599
He said I would get the medicine here.

583
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,101
Yes, so give me 15 nyang.

584
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,688
-I do not have any money left.
-Then I cannot give you medicine.

585
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,648
You need to leave.

586
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,861
I will not leave
before I get the medicine.

587
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,946
I need that medicine right now.

588
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,991
Then bring money tomorrow
and take the medicine then.

589
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,160
It is not easy for me to come out.

590
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,995
I will come later and pay you,

591
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,705
so could you give me the medicine?

592
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:32,915
Do you know me?

593
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,585
How can I trust you and give you
the medicine without getting paid?

594
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,962
Then at least leave collateral.

595
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,048
I will leave the collateral for him.

596
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:42,883
Pardon?

597
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,312
If he pays you for the medicine,
return this knife to me.

598
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,731
If he does not, then sell it as you like.

599
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,817
It is made of silver,
so it should be worth a lot.

600
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,611
Are you two acquainted?

601
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,988
How do you trust this man?

602
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,490
He looks so desperate.

603
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,790
Thank you.

604
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,627
You can return and pay him back.

605
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,046
It used to belong to my mother,

606
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,259
so please return it to me.

607
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,305
I will pay it back myself
in ten days at this hour.

608
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:40,649
Now that you paid for the medicine,
let me see.

609
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,735
Since when was it your mother's?

610
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,405
Your mother is still alive and well.

611
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,739
I did not say she died.

612
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,825
I just said it belonged to her.

613
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:55,330
Also, if I want to catch a big fish,
I must use good bait.

614
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,916
But why did you go that far?

615
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,587
He was so handsome
that I wanted to meet him again.

616
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,381
Oh, my. That is so embarrassing.

617
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,341
Why should only men approach a woman?

618
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,136
Women can seize a man they like too.

619
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,055
Do you think he will meet with you?
He seems like a decent man.

620
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,142
You are already notorious
among matchmakers.

621
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,145
-What do they say?
-"Do not even consider

622
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,272
the eldest daughter
of the Minister of War."

623
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,898
But he does not know who I am.

624
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,072
Milk vetch root,

625
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,867
foxglove, white woodland peony…

626
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,882
Hey, Master Toji said he needs
more honeysuckle and weeping forsythia.

627
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,216
And it is urgent.

628
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,968
He must be short of herbs.

629
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,348
He probably has no idea that he paid
for the medicine of the hut villagers.

630
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,099
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

631
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,412
-Be punctual, will you?
-Let's go.

632
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,592
Very well.

633
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,506
-Why did you hit me more?
-You deserve it!

634
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,385
You should be setting
an example for your younger brothers,

635
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,887
but you took them out
and jumped over the palace wall?

636
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,182
You even took innocent Prince Simso too.

637
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,187
Was it not enough for you Grand Princes
to be known as mischief-makers?

638
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,815
-Please calm down.
-Calm down?

639
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,612
You have no idea how I feel. You brats.

640
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,868
The first exam was over.
We did not qualify for the second exam.

641
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,871
Do you still have no idea
how dangerous this was?

642
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,124
Think of the times.

643
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,543
Do you not remember
how the plague broke out?

644
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:50,088
Be grateful that you came back fine.
What if something happened out there?

645
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,217
How many people do you think
you would have cost for your debauchery?

646
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,802
I will never…

647
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,763
do that again.

648
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,975
Prince Simso, you may leave.

649
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:08,732
Be honest with your mother,
and say that Grand Prince Muan coaxed you

650
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,983
and ask for forgiveness.

651
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,694
Yes, Your Majesty.

652
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,667
Well, Your Majesty.

653
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,631
No one coaxed me into it.

654
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,049
I wanted to do it.

655
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,928
I made a decision on my own
for the first time in my life.

656
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,682
And…

657
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:47,854
it was also
the most entertaining day of my life.

658
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,326
If you enjoyed it, fine.

659
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,790
Then I shall
keep it a secret from your mother.

660
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,334
Do you mean that?

661
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,059
Go to bed early!

662
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,669
I cannot do this, Your Highness.

663
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,671
We should do anything to cure my brother.

664
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,381
But Your Highness,

665
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,968
I cannot treat His Royal Highness
with a remedy from a commoner.

666
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,680
But the usual treatment has not worked,
so we should take another measure.

667
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,016
What is going on?

668
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,565
Your Majesty.

669
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,734
My life is already in danger

670
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,612
as I treat His Royal Highness
without His Majesty knowing.

671
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:23,241
But if anything goes wrong after I use
a prescription and herbs from the outside,

672
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,787
I will be held responsible for it.

673
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,416
It is not that I do not trust
Physician Kwon.

674
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,335
This physician has cured hyeolheogwol.

675
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,503
So we should at least give this a try.

676
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,557
-We cannot.
-Mother!

677
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,685
It is as Physician Kwon said.
We cannot use herbs and a prescription

678
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,604
from the outside on the Crown Prince.

679
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,606
Then is there another way?

680
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:57,776
We have tried everything there is,
yet he is not getting better.

681
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,194
We still cannot.

682
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:03,782
I cannot use an unverified prescription
on the Crown Prince.

683
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,785
Then at least stop
the acupuncture for the time being.

684
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:10,246
The physician said leaving his
acupuncture points untouched will help.

685
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,375
Mother.

686
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,962
Please do as he says.

687
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,306
Please do so

688
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,101
even if it is for a few days.

689
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,981
I wish to stand up.

690
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,859
I wish to try what I can.

691
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,122
Physician Kwon.

692
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,586
Stop his acupuncture treatment
for a while.

693
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,465
-But Your Majesty…
-It is irrelevant to the prescription.

694
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,551
If this becomes a problem,

695
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,846
I will be responsible.

696
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,516
Let us count the ballots.

697
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,649
Prince Uiseong.

698
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:25,780
Prince Bogeom.

699
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,908
Grand Prince Seongnam.

700
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,631
This is the final ballot.

701
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,345
Prince Bogeom.

702
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,307
Four for Prince Bogeom.

703
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,351
Four for Prince Uiseong.
Three for Grand Prince Seongnam.

704
00:55:55,435 --> 00:56:00,148
When the first and second exams are added,
the highest score belongs to…

705
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,359
Prince Bogeom is selected

706
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:07,155
as the cohort to the Crown Prince
at Sigangwon.

707
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:28,343
You said you would give your support
to Prince Uiseong.

708
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,304
I did exert my influence.

709
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,224
I told them to evaluate fairly

710
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,894
and choose the best,
most worthy one among them.

711
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,438
-Your Royal Highness.
-I could have given my support

712
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,358
to Prince Uiseong as you asked.

713
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,820
However, if he had
received all of the votes unfairly,

714
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,614
what do you think would have happened?

715
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,701
Even if Prince Uiseong
was selected as the cohort,

716
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,412
do you think His Majesty
would have accepted it?

717
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,665
Not a chance.

718
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,171
Through this cohort selection,
His Majesty realized

719
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:10,385
the sons of his concubines
are brighter than the Grand Princes.

720
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,889
And you realized
that you do not have enough power

721
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,893
to make a prince into a mere cohort.

722
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,897
I do not think

723
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:27,485
you came to see me
just to turn him into a mere cohort.

724
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,865
So stay calm
and wait for the right opportunity.

725
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:38,955
One does not wait
for the right opportunity, but creates it,

726
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,415
just as you did.

727
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,127
You are the one who taught me that,
so why do you say that?

728
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,925
Your Royal Highness,
Her Majesty is here to see you.

729
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,012
Let her in.

730
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,874
When it is based on their abilities,

731
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,835
the Grand Princes
cannot even be selected as a cohort.

732
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,589
If anything happens to the Crown Prince,

733
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:34,177
his position is no longer promised
to the Grand Princes.

734
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,055
Did you ask for me
to make sure I know that?

735
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,849
I asked for you to inquire
about the condition of the Crown Prince.

736
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,728
Has the Crown Prince gotten better?

737
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:48,107
If he has not, will anything change?

738
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,984
It should.

739
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,154
Many things will change.

740
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,243
Do you even hope…

741
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,079
for the Crown Prince to get better?

742
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,706
I truly wish

743
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:09,212
the Crown Prince would return
to his healthy self.

744
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,048
I mean this.

745
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,637
Is that truly how you feel?

746
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,556
How I feel is not important.

747
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,140
You just saw him.

748
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,477
The Chief State Councilor came to
my quarters over a cohort selection.

749
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,689
So what if people find out
that the Crown Prince is ill?

750
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,607
Do you think they will just sit around?

751
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,652
Therefore,

752
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,697
the Crown Prince
must be fully restored to health

753
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,741
until the day
of the Crown Princess' delivery.

754
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,660
If he is not,

755
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,955
then I will have no choice
but to take action

756
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,873
to maintain the stability of the throne.

757
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:51,379
For if I do not,
they will take action first.

758
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,054
Does she mean

759
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,599
she will depose the Crown Prince?

760
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,560
If people find out
about his critical condition,

761
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,437
then that is a possibility.

762
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:13,943
If His Royal Highness is deposed
due to his illness

763
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,946
-and none of the Grand Princes succeeds…
-Then…

764
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,074
we may all die.

765
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,453
So we have no other way.

766
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,874
We must show everyone

767
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,003
-that he is in good health.
-But Your Majesty,

768
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:35,673
the Crown Princess is due
in less than five days.

769
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,300
What should we do?

770
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,141
Send for Physician Kwon now.

771
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,237
Use the prescription and herbs
Grand Prince Seongnam brought.

772
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,116
If anything happens,

773
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:07,747
I will take responsibility
in my position as the Queen.

774
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,276
Your Highness, you are almost there.

775
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,570
Just a little more, Your Royal Highness.

776
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,281
Your Royal Highness, push a bit harder.

777
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,619
You are almost done.

778
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,444
His Royal Highness probably came, right?

779
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:22,363
I am sure he ran over at once.

780
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,158
She was due prematurely,
so she made a fuss for a few days.

781
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,743
He must already be in there.

782
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,167
Oh, my.

783
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,086
The Crown Prince is not here, right?

784
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,922
The rumors about his condition
must be true.

785
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,591
I guess so.

786
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,843
Otherwise, why would he not show up

787
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:47,138
-to his princess' delivery?
-His Majesty the King has arrived.

788
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,359
You are all here.

789
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,361
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

790
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:06,991
My Queen,
has the Crown Prince not returned?

791
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,202
No, Your Majesty. The Crown Prince--

792
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,912
His skin condition must be grave

793
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:16,250
if he did not return to the palace
even when his child was born.

794
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,668
Or…

795
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,672
it must be impossible for him to return.

796
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:31,849
Crown Prince!

797
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,706
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

798
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,041
Yes.

799
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,335
When did you return?

800
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,588
I left upon hearing
the news of the Crown Princess,

801
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,841
but the journey was tough,
so I am a bit late.

802
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,554
Onyang must have been great.

803
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:12,932
It seems to me
that you have become even healthier.

804
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,684
Crown Prince.

805
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,146
The Crown Princess must be waiting.
You should go inside.

806
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,688
Your Majesty,
was I the only one who noticed it?

807
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:03,107
When His Royal Highness walked in,

808
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,776
your shoulders stood taller,

809
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,864
and the concubines dropped
their gazes and heads.

810
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,117
I also felt it.

811
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,912
I feel much more at ease

812
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,164
now that I see that
His Royal Highness has gotten better.

813
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,334
It is still too early to be relieved.

814
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,087
Your Majesty, he has not lost
consciousness for four days,

815
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:28,215
since he started
to receive that treatment.

816
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,885
His disease must be getting cured.

817
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:35,097
-Do you think so too?
-Yes.

818
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,935
The prescription
Grand Prince Seongnam brought

819
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,312
played a big role.

820
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:46,525
Court Lady Shin,
gather all the boys tonight.

821
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,987
Let us all eat together.

822
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,739
Yes, Your Majesty.

823
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,000
How is the preparation coming along?
What about hot pot rice?

824
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,378
Yes, my lady. We are almost done.

825
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,545
Very well.

826
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:24,313
This is the best dish
to restore your health and energy.

827
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,232
Make sure you eat everything.

828
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,193
Yes, Mother.

829
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,862
Do not just sit there. Eat up.

830
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:46,127
Brother, did you enjoy the hot spring?

831
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,797
Please take us with you next time.

832
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,343
I will.

833
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,391
Your firstborn wanted a sister.

834
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:01,559
He must be thrilled.

835
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:03,436
He is not the only one.

836
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,147
I am also glad to have my first daughter.

837
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,231
She is adorable.

838
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:12,570
Now, have some of this too.
This is your favorite.

839
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,575
Mother, are you playing favorites?

840
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,994
Right, you should eat some too.

841
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:22,621
I do not like bulgogi.

842
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,622
Right.

843
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,083
Then have some of this.

844
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,918
I do not like japchae either.

845
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,715
-Have some hot pot rice first.
-I do not like abalone either--

846
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,677
Just eat.

847
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,013
Okay, Brother.

848
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,809
Have some of this.

849
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,687
A big one for you.

850
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:48,355
Are you playing favorites?

851
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,589
I hear you went through a lot
to find the medicine.

852
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,383
It was much tougher
than whatever it is that you heard.

853
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,677
I cannot do that again.

854
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,097
So do not be ill again.

855
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,684
Do you know how tough it is
to lie around all day?

856
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,145
I cannot do that again either.

857
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,318
It is great to be out here.

858
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,279
Right.

859
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,074
There is something
I have been meaning to ask you.

860
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:44,120
When I first went to Seochon,
why did you not ask?

861
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,497
That is random. What do you mean?

862
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,041
You were surprised to know
you had an older brother,

863
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,961
yet you never asked me about our parents.

864
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:57,216
You were a young kid,
so I am sure you were dying to ask

865
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,468
about our mother's whereabouts.

866
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,183
When I lived in Seochon,

867
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,104
there was a woman who came
and cried once in a while.

868
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,483
At first, I thought she had a sad story.

869
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,612
But she just cried whenever she saw me.

870
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:26,537
Then how did you know
I was living in the hut village?

871
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,581
It was Mother.

872
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,210
She took me there.

873
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:37,089
She got caught crying
like a woman with a sad story,

874
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,967
so she must have sent me instead
because she was embarrassed.

875
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:45,639
Kang.

876
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,059
Now that I have overcome
a critical moment,

877
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,020
I want to live even more.

878
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,648
There are so many things I want to do.

879
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,402
You can do them all.

880
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:03,157
Yes, I shall do all of them.

881
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,537
Where are you going?

882
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,374
To see my daughter whom I already miss.

883
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,982
There are nine unchanging ethics
in this world

884
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,401
to govern the world and a kingdom.

885
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,446
Honoring the virtuous ones.

886
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,908
Respecting the noblemen
and embracing them.

887
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,329
Looking after the people
like they are one's own children.

888
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,707
Showing respect for the court officials.

889
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:03,050
Admiring those who are wise.

890
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,698
Crown Prince!

891
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,249
Crown Prince…

892
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,608
Crown Prince!

893
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,742
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

894
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,644
What were you doing
while keeping all this from me?

895
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,647
Starting today, the Queen
will stay in her quarters.

896
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:44,735
Please, Your Majesty.
At least allow me to see the Crown Prince.

897
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,445
We cannot defer it any longer.

898
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,364
We must make the deposition public.

899
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,492
Would it not also be in the interest
of Her Royal Highness

900
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:54,578
to fairly select a wise Crown Prince?

901
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:56,538
No one can find out about

902
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,624
the prescription and medicine
brought from the outside.

903
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:02,503
It is clear my son was murdered.

904
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:07,591
