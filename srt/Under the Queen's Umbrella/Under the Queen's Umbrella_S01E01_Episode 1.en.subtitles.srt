1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,724
EPISODE 1

3
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,235
-Where is that brat?
-Well…

4
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,742
What are you waiting for?

5
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,889
Who are you to be
acting with such insolence?

6
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,682
Me?

7
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,148
Someone who can carry out

8
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,027
whatever lunacy and get away with it.

9
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,988
What I am saying is

10
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,993
that I could kill you here and now
without any consequences if I wish to.

11
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,427
-I did not even get to say goodbye.
-I did that for you.

12
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,846
Cho-wol is not just a mere courtesan.
She is a dear friend.

13
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,765
A friend you share a bed with?

14
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,767
Forget her.

15
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
How could I?

16
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,771
Father has more than ten wives.

17
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,565
Why do I not even get to have one?

18
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,693
Then you should be a king.

19
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,066
Your Royal Highness.

20
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,944
The Crown Prince and Princess are here.

21
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,029
They are?

22
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,780
Send them in.

23
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,292
Did you have a good night?

24
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,049
Great-Grandmother.

25
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,176
Did you have a good night?

26
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,762
May you live long and prosper.

27
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,931
Come here.

28
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,315
Oh, my.

29
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:03,613
Now I have everything
that I have ever wished for.

30
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,365
I would have no regrets

31
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,368
if I were to die right now.

32
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,580
Grandmother.

33
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,999
May you live a long and healthy life.

34
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,087
Pillars cannot stand straight
without a foundation.

35
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,464
His Majesty needs your support

36
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,050
to remain strong.

37
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,929
I will remember that, Crown Prince.

38
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,518
Do you intend to let those people
starve to death?

39
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,103
Your Majesty.

40
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,022
It is to stop the plague.

41
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,608
We have sealed off the hut village
in Seochon to do that, have we not?

42
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,904
But people have even set fire to them
out of hatred for the villagers.

43
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,407
If we stop providing them relief,

44
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,828
they will surely suffer from starvation.

45
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,664
That is where the plague started.

46
00:06:54,747 --> 00:07:00,086
It would be unnecessary to provide relief
at the risk of infection, Your Majesty.

47
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,922
Even if all deaths from the disease
cannot be prevented,

48
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,885
I cannot let my people starve to death.

49
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:13,182
Please, remember that there are even
more of your people outside that village.

50
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,270
It is a sacrifice for the greater good.

51
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,147
He is right, Your Majesty.

52
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,191
If access to the village
is granted to provide relief,

53
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,652
we might end up
endangering the entire capital.

54
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,322
It is said that the symptoms
improve within two weeks.

55
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,365
We can provide relief

56
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,577
as long as we isolate the officials
who have visited Seochon.

57
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:39,000
Anyone who enters the village
shall never be let outside again.

58
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,421
The plague started in Seochon,

59
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,798
so it must also end there.

60
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:51,012
That is what I intend to do as well.

61
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,976
Your Majesty.

62
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:02,940
Some state affairs
are to be approached with determination.

63
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,487
If determination is what is asked of me,

64
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,156
I shall display it.

65
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,912
Here is what I will do.

66
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,792
Establish a temporary relief station
in an area near the huts in Seochon.

67
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,171
But we will only deliver food
to the villagers,

68
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,048
and we will not make any close contact.

69
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,343
Also, reinforce the security in the area

70
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,263
and keep the quarantined under control.

71
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,682
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

72
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,661
How did it go?
Has everyone left for Jonghak?

73
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,081
Grand Prince Ilyeong is still fast asleep.

74
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,291
Grand Prince Seongnam is also missing.

75
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,586
It was your job to watch over them
as I could not be everywhere.

76
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,171
Was that too much to ask?

77
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,798
I have my hands full.

78
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,633
Not a day goes by without trouble!

79
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,759
-Forgive us, Your Majesty.
-Forgive us, Your Majesty.

80
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,803
Move along.
Where is Grand Prince Seongnam?

81
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,180
Where is he?

82
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,309
JONGHAK: EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION
FOR THE PRINCES AND THOSE OF ROYAL DESCENT

83
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,106
Goodness…

84
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,736
Eunuch Kim.

85
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,156
How early must we get here
to be at the front of the line?

86
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,743
I lost sleep so that I could be here
as early as possible and still…

87
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:23,080
I was here all night,
but I am still at the back of the line.

88
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,248
My goodness.

89
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,418
GUUNMONG

90
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,211
Oh, my.

91
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,423
Grand Prince Gyeseong.

92
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,176
Why did you not have one of your men
stand in line for you?

93
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,388
That would have only caused
further inconvenience. Do not mind me.

94
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,223
You should ready yourself to run.

95
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,563
Watch out!

96
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,238
Go in!

97
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,282
Move!

98
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,200
That is my seat.

99
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:02,995
That was close.

100
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,019
PRINCE UISEONG

101
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,897
FIRST JUNIOR CONSORT HWANG
(DISTINGUISHED CONCUBINE)

102
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,650
How did you find the tutors?

103
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,902
The arithmetic tutor was rather lacking.

104
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,321
Then I shall replace that one.

105
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,284
PRINCE SIMSO
FIRST JUNIOR CONSORT KO

106
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,454
PRINCE YEONGMIN
SECOND SENIOR CONSORT KIM

107
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,208
It is perfect weather for studying.

108
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,753
PRINCE NAMHYEON
FOURTH SENIOR CONSORT MOON

109
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,172
Prince Bogeom.

110
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:59,468
His Majesty and the Queen Dowager
will be visiting Jonghak today.

111
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,761
Are you not nervous?

112
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,472
I will just act as I always have.

113
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,270
PRINCE HODONG
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT OK

114
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,282
Your Majesty.

115
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,909
I searched everywhere,
but I could not find him.

116
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,707
Why today of all days?

117
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,001
Why?

118
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,253
Your Majesty, you shall hurry.

119
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,840
All the princes must gather
at Jonghak within half an hour.

120
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,237
Wake up.

121
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,407
-Wake up right now.
-Let me sleep a little more.

122
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,825
Wake up!

123
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,333
You are awake, right?

124
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,668
-Wake up and get ready to run.
-Why?

125
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,088
Why else? You must be there before
His Majesty and the Queen Dowager.

126
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,759
-And if I am not?
-Then you and I are both doomed.

127
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,225
Well done.

128
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,605
Is this the best you could do?

129
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,649
Forgive me.

130
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,121
-Prince Hodong.
-Hello, Grand Prince Muan.

131
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,376
The mothers are at it again.

132
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,129
Prince Bogeom.

133
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,549
You should walk once in a while.

134
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,322
Here are your snacks.

135
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,950
You must eat to keep yourself healthy.

136
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,203
Come here.

137
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,164
Prince Simso.

138
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,836
This pill provides nutrients to the brain.
Chew and swallow it.

139
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,017
Get a good look at what Prince Uiseong
is reading if you can see that far.

140
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,935
Sorry? Why?

141
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,646
I think his book…

142
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,357
looks a little different.

143
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,403
JUJASEOJEOLYO

144
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,780
I knew it.

145
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,491
That must be Jujaseojeolyo.

146
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,910
What is that?

147
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,039
It is a collection of Confucian texts
compiled by Master Toegye.

148
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,047
One cannot understand Jujaseojeolyo
without reading Daehak and Noneo.

149
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,550
Then he must have read them both.

150
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,344
My goodness.

151
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,139
They were not covered at Jonghak.
When did he finish them?

152
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,617
Is this not His Majesty's first visit here
since he ascended the throne?

153
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,118
That is right.

154
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,372
I wonder why he has never visited before.

155
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,291
He would not have had the time for us

156
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,294
since the Crown Prince
is studying at Sigangwon.

157
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,381
His Majesty has arrived.

158
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,163
Grand Prince Seongnam…

159
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,999
Gosh. He is not here yet.

160
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,365
SIGANGWON: EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION
EXCLUSIVE TO CROWN PRINCE

161
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,206
Will you explain
the meaning of that passage?

162
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,961
It means that the outcome of your actions
is independent of your abilities.

163
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,466
The number of competent subjects
a King has in his court does not matter

164
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,261
if he ends up squandering his wealth by
letting a dishonest subject deceive him.

165
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:46,023
It is said that a wise man
who knows right from wrong

166
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,570
is careful even when he drinks from
a stream that belongs to no one.

167
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,197
So today,

168
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,493
we are going to learn about
the duties of a wise man.

169
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:04,458
What do you think
a wise man's duty should be?

170
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,550
If one entrusts an unworthy subject
to lead the country,

171
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,677
the nation will face great catastrophes.

172
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,612
TONG, OUTSTANDING

173
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,625
Now I would like to pose

174
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,754
one whimsical question to you princes.

175
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,632
Bing, the word for "ice…"

176
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,928
becomes su, meaning "water."

177
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,099
Could you explain what has happened?

178
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,524
HWA, FIRE

179
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,320
It reminded me of the word hwan,
meaning "to return."

180
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,158
As ice was originally water,

181
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,743
it could be said to be returning
to its original state.

182
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,749
My answer is chun, meaning "spring."

183
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,462
By the course of nature, ice melts,

184
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,715
and plants and trees absorb water.

185
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,969
When plants survive the cold
and blossom in spring,

186
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,013
ice becomes water.

187
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,226
My answer…

188
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,770
is yi, meaning "to transfer."

189
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,277
What makes you say that?

190
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,071
When the ice is removed
from the Han River,

191
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,907
we are able to access the water below.

192
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,244
And when that ice is transferred
into the ice storage house,

193
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,289
it can be useful in the summer.

194
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,836
Prince Bogeom has provided
a rather practical answer.

195
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,475
I would like you princes to break free
from the confines of your studies

196
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,227
and think relentlessly

197
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,648
so that you may develop the ability
to come up with new ideas.

198
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,984
Well done, everyone.

199
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,134
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM
(SECOND SON OF THE QUEEN)

200
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,888
Is that not Grand Prince Seongnam
who always comes in last at Jonghak?

201
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,392
He also came last
in arriving at the lesson today.

202
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,434
Lower your voice.

203
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,761
Consort Hwang.

204
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,266
If you have time, shall we have some tea?

205
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,184
With pleasure, Your Royal Highness.

206
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,605
Then I will be waiting outside.

207
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,779
Well, I shall be going now.

208
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,407
Should you not do something

209
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,326
about those troublemakers?

210
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,579
By "troublemakers,"

211
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,334
do you perhaps mean the Grand Princes?

212
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,419
Yes.

213
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,213
They are your grandsons.

214
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,673
Even so,

215
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,093
I detest them for bringing worry
to my child's heart.

216
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,598
You saw what happened back there,
did you not?

217
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,725
They should be setting
an example as Grand Princes,

218
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,269
but one of them barely arrived in time.

219
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,773
They were distracted and daydreaming
during the lesson.

220
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,942
In addition, one of them even arrived
in the middle of the lesson.

221
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,530
Grand Prince Gyeseong
seems to be interested in learning,

222
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:50,285
but he is no match
for Prince Bogeom or Prince Uiseong.

223
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,871
What use is it to excel in Jonghak?

224
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:57,209
This is merely a place
where the princes acquire

225
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,794
the most basic knowledge.

226
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,088
And this is also
where His Majesty studied.

227
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,467
Usually, Sigangwon is where
future kings are born.

228
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,892
The Crown Prince is being
properly educated to become the King.

229
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,437
I assure you that you have
nothing to worry about.

230
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:24,820
I now see that your confidence
stems from the Crown Prince.

231
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,863
However…

232
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,158
how much longer do you think

233
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,120
the Crown Prince can make up for
the mischief of his brothers?

234
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,830
Your Royal Highness.

235
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,667
The ladies of the royal palace
and the princes

236
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,252
are my responsibility.

237
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,671
If not for the Crown Prince,

238
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:47,175
I would have doubted
that you were fulfilling your duties.

239
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,719
As you probably know,

240
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,055
the Queen is busier than she seems.

241
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,724
Well then,

242
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,394
if you will excuse me…

243
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,190
As I have never been the Queen myself,

244
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,735
I did not know how busy you were.

245
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,656
I have an appointment
with the tutor of the Crown Prince.

246
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,450
Do you have anything else to say?

247
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,093
Why did you do that?

248
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,598
You ran around all morning
to please Her Royal Highness

249
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,266
only to upset her with your words.

250
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,310
She started it.

251
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,312
She referred to my sons as troublemakers.

252
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,987
Maybe this is for the better.

253
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,199
Now that I have lost favor with her,
I should stop nagging my sons.

254
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,410
They will leave the palace
when they get married anyway.

255
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,169
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

256
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,463
What about the banquet preparations?

257
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,215
That can wait until tomorrow.

258
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,675
But you never postpone anything.

259
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,846
Now that I stood up to Her Royal Highness,
I fear nothing in the world.

260
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,432
Who cares if there is a little delay?

261
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,643
I shall stop by Sigangwon.

262
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:26,107
His Royal Highness earned an "outstanding"
in every subject on the test today.

263
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:34,241
He has never gotten a grade
below "outstanding" in any test so far.

264
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,493
It is truly incredible.

265
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,832
Is that right?

266
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,672
This news brings much joy.

267
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,216
I wish I could let everyone know.

268
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,051
I feel the happiest

269
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,347
when I see you smile in that way.

270
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,765
Is that so?

271
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,101
Then I shall smile bigger.

272
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,658
If you ever say such a thing again,

273
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,535
you will end up dead.

274
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,997
Are you upset that I insulted your mother?

275
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,790
-You little…
-What is going on?

276
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,944
It is true.

277
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,238
While the other princes
boast of their knowledge,

278
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,366
all the Grand Princes
do not seem to pay it any mind.

279
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,453
Did that upset you?

280
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,705
Not at all. It is no big deal.

281
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,790
They cannot hold government posts anyway.

282
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,960
What good would studying do?
All they need is to stay healthy.

283
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,465
But do you know

284
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,176
what people say about the Grand Princes?

285
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,804
That they are a stain
on the reputation of His Majesty.

286
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,889
Those brats.

287
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,643
Even if they cannot set a good example,
they should not become a nuisance.

288
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,770
Mother.

289
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,441
They are more thoughtful than you think.
You do not have to worry.

290
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:35,236
They may be mischievous,
but they would never harm anyone.

291
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,281
All right.

292
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:44,037
I am greatly relieved to hear that.

293
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,172
Crown Prince!

294
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,341
-Surround him!
-Crown Prince!

295
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,178
Wake up.

296
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,930
Crown Prince.

297
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,973
Call the physician immediately.

298
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,810
-Crown Prince.
-Your Royal Highness.

299
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,479
Wake up, Crown Prince.

300
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,772
Crown Prince.

301
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,827
Do you all intend
to keep your mouths shut?

302
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,873
Tell me, Prince Uiseong.

303
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:34,921
Why did you let the Grand Princes
assault you without resistance?

304
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,306
What on earth happened?

305
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,311
Grandmother, we did not attack--

306
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,569
Is no one going to tell me?

307
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:06,244
Consort Hwang,
take Prince Uiseong with you.

308
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,218
This has never happened before.

309
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,804
My son has never done anything like this.

310
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,807
Who do you take after to be so impudent?

311
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:43,239
Do you all think you are special
because you are the sons of the Queen?

312
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,950
How dare you join hands

313
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,953
to assault your half-brother?

314
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,540
Kneel.

315
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,211
Now!

316
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,320
Remain on your knees
until the twenty-third hour.

317
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,741
The rain will pour down soon.

318
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,785
Will they be all right?

319
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,788
Bring the Queen
to my quarters immediately.

320
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,221
Report my arrival.

321
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,059
You will have to come back later.

322
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,105
-Her Majesty asked to be left alone--
-Just do as I say.

323
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,945
What brings you here?

324
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,240
I have a message for Her Majesty. Move.

325
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,576
You may say it to me.

326
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,747
Very well.

327
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,917
The Queen Dowager has asked
for her audience urgently.

328
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,501
She should go to her quarters immediately.

329
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,754
I will relay the message.

330
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,948
Step down.

331
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,917
Shame on you.

332
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,337
You should not have said such a thing
if you could not say it to her face.

333
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,465
Moreover, she is the Queen.

334
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,969
Does it not anger you?

335
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,054
You should have been the Queen

336
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,683
-and I should have been the Crown Prince.
-Watch your mouth!

337
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,853
One's criticisms only ring hollow
unless one earns their right.

338
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,313
Be it your studies or character,

339
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,108
are you better than
the Crown Prince in any way?

340
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:11,364
I will always be Father's firstborn,

341
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,782
not that darned Crown Prince.

342
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,206
Once you manage to surpass him,

343
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,668
you are free to criticize him,
complain about him,

344
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,129
or take over his position.

345
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,467
But prove yourself before any of that.

346
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,672
What on earth is the diagnosis?

347
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,967
Even though I cannot be completely sure,

348
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,303
it seems to be hyeolheogwol.

349
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,804
HYEOLHEOGWOL: A DISEASE CAUSED
BY BLOOD DEFICIENCY AND FATIGUE

350
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,764
Hyeolheogwol?

351
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,474
Yes.

352
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,727
It causes one to collapse
due to the lack of blood in one's body.

353
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,605
When did the symptoms begin?

354
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,482
It was about a year ago.

355
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,402
Then why did I not know
about this until now?

356
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,281
It was because the symptoms
were manageable.

357
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,825
But recently, he began to collapse
more and more often

358
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,788
and remained unconscious
for longer periods.

359
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,082
Why did you not tell me sooner?

360
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:48,169
His Royal Highness insisted on keeping it
from you so that you would not worry.

361
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,754
You still should have told me.

362
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,673
How could you let the situation
get so serious?

363
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,723
Now tell me.

364
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,185
Will he survive?

365
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,649
I am afraid to tell you this,

366
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,362
but the late Crown Prince Taein is said
to have passed away from the same disease.

367
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,824
How dare you commit
such sacrilege before Her Majesty?

368
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,992
With all due respect,

369
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,703
the disease is curable in most cases.

370
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,705
However, in this case,
it seems hereditary.

371
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,917
I was hoping that this information
could help with his treatment.

372
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,340
Did you say it could help
with his treatment?

373
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,677
Explain clearly.

374
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,057
One of the royal physicians

375
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,019
who treated the late Crown Prince Taein
was Cho Guk-yeong.

376
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,898
He may still remember
the remedy and the circumstances.

377
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,569
Cho Guk-yeong?

378
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,951
I shall look into it.

379
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,789
Meanwhile, I forbid you to mention

380
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:11,127
the condition of the Crown Prince
to anyone until it becomes official.

381
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,129
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,716
I am sorry to say this,

383
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,219
but His Royal Highness cannot be
away from his quarters for too long.

384
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,429
What shall we do?

385
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,850
He shall stay here tonight.

386
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,894
Yes, Your Majesty.

387
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,654
Do you plan to inform His Majesty
of his condition?

388
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,489
I do.

389
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,366
It concerns the Crown Prince.

390
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,912
However, if you inform him,

391
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,831
it will remind him of the incident.

392
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,084
It will

393
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:57,465
since he must be aware of what caused
the death of Crown Prince Taein.

394
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:04,263
But I need his permission
to get in touch with Cho Guk-yeong.

395
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,932
I advise you to tread carefully.

396
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:10,019
Skin disease alone should be enough
to have him grant you his permission.

397
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,691
I cannot say for sure.

398
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,195
I shall decide once I meet His Majesty.

399
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,543
Your Majesty.

400
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,546
I need to speak to His Majesty urgently.

401
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,885
I am afraid that His Majesty
has retired for the night.

402
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,697
I shall come back tomorrow.

403
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,145
I desperately waited for you
in my quarters,

404
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,939
but you never appeared.

405
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,734
So I decided to visit you myself.

406
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,069
If you do not mind,

407
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,989
may we speak here?

408
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,999
Are you so busy

409
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,753
that you cannot spare even a moment?

410
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,259
Even so, should you not have kept
a closer eye on the princes,

411
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,971
which you said were your responsibility?

412
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,185
What do you mean by that?

413
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:18,773
The Grand Princes
are being punished as we speak

414
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,984
for joining hands
to attack Prince Uiseong.

415
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,542
Go see whether the Crown Prince
is in his quarters immediately.

416
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,337
Find out where my sons are.

417
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,931
I am sorry.

418
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,185
Had you not hit him, I would have.

419
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,231
Why did you stop me
from telling Grandmother?

420
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,358
She should know.

421
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,693
He may have provoked us,

422
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,029
but we were the ones
who resorted to violence.

423
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,531
I agree.

424
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,907
We should be punished.

425
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,659
But at this rate…

426
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,374
we may freeze to death.

427
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,502
Stand up before you freeze to death!

428
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,811
Go back to your quarters.

429
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,694
Grandmother ordered us to remain
on our knees until the twenty-third hour.

430
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,404
Do as I say.

431
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,032
Stand up.

432
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,376
Why is everyone running today
instead of riding their palanquins?

433
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,669
I have no idea.

434
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,921
Look how fast they are running.

435
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,050
My legs are still numb after having
kneeled for so long yesterday.

436
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,221
Stop it.

437
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,641
Prince Simso!

438
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,102
Why is everyone running? What is going on?

439
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,729
There will be tutelage of relations
at Jonghak today.

440
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,314
Tutelage of relations?

441
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,942
Tutelage of relations?

442
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,027
All of you, hurry!

443
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,071
-We need to get good seats!
-What is that?

444
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,781
Something that we must learn
no matter what!

445
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,371
Tutelage of relations

446
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,249
is an important subject
where one learns about

447
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:09,044
how to maintain human nature
while conducting oneself appropriately.

448
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,215
Namely, it teaches one
how to approach sexual intercourse

449
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,592
wisely and with discipline.

450
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,304
In the royal family,
the production of offspring

451
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,764
is more than just a way
to carry on the family line.

452
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,560
It is an act that ensures
the royal bloodline is perpetuated.

453
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,521
Therefore, I ask you
to take this lesson in earnest.

454
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,277
Our first topic is

455
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,031
the appropriate frequency
with regard to sexual intercourse.

456
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,575
According to Pobakja,

457
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:43,245
it should be once every three
to four days for a person in his twenties.

458
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,249
Once every ten days
for a person in his thirties.

459
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,880
Moderation is key
when it comes to sexual intercourse.

460
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:54,965
Master.

461
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,593
Then would someone in their teens

462
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,013
partake in intercourse more often
than every three or four days?

463
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,309
As I am nineteen years of age,
should I have intercourse every two days?

464
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,481
You shall be in your twenties
once you are wed.

465
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,360
Therefore, I advise you to follow
the corresponding guidelines then.

466
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,444
All right.

467
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,530
Please, turn to page three
of your textbook.

468
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,555
The most basic position

469
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:48,185
is two people facing each other
and becoming one.

470
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:52,815
I have never seen Muan
pay this much attention in class before.

471
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,275
When it comes to tutelage of relations,

472
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,112
he would be top of the class.

473
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,663
Greetings.

474
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,706
Did you have a good night?

475
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,417
Your Majesty.

476
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,545
I heard that you are sending
Kim Ja-hong to China

477
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,923
along with his first son.

478
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,800
That is right.

479
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,927
It is so that he may become an envoy

480
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,762
who is well-versed in current affairs.

481
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,557
But is not his first son

482
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:31,645
the cohort of the Crown Prince
at Sigangwon?

483
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,772
Yes, he is.

484
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,982
Does that mean…

485
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,236
his position will be vacant for some time?

486
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,449
What?

487
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,495
A new cohort will be chosen from Jonghak?
But it was to be left vacant.

488
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,456
I do not know why,

489
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:54,877
but it has been announced
that one of the princes will be selected.

490
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,175
How is the Crown Prince?

491
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,969
He has been safely escorted
back to his quarters,

492
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,014
but he has yet to regain consciousness.

493
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:56,647
Consort Hwang,
you look especially beautiful today.

494
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,484
By the way, may I ask
what you put in your scented sachet?

495
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,653
The fragrance is absolutely lovely.

496
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,073
-I do not carry a scented sachet.
-Oh, my.

497
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,117
Then is it your skin
that smells this lovely?

498
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,293
And who is she supposed to be?

499
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,508
When did His Majesty
find someone so young?

500
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,081
The newly favored lady of the court,
what is your surname?

501
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,000
It is Park.

502
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:03,630
A favored concubine enters the ranks
as Fourth Junior Consort

503
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,007
only after bearing a son.

504
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,260
The title that will be bestowed
on you today is Special Court Lady.

505
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:13,015
From now on, be sure
to behave properly at all times.

506
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

507
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,313
Where did you use to work?

508
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,441
I was in the bedchamber
of the Queen Dowager.

509
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,612
I see His Majesty's taste
in women remains consistent.

510
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,781
I mean,

511
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,701
he found one of us
in the quarters of Her Majesty,

512
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,163
another in the quarters of his son,

513
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,248
and now one in the quarters of his mother.

514
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,503
I should cover all the faces of my
court ladies when he comes to visit me.

515
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,589
If one of them were to appear here,

516
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,175
it would make the both of us
ever-so uncomfortable.

517
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,389
His Majesty saw me on the street.

518
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,476
I see.

519
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,977
By the way,

520
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,772
you should sit
on the other side next time.

521
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,814
Pardon?

522
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,983
Only the distinguished concubines

523
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,195
who passed the official selection process

524
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,156
sit on this side.

525
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,743
I agree. You do not look like
you belong on that side.

526
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:19,373
Your beauty stands out too much
among the distinguished concubines.

527
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,085
Next time, do sit with us
so that you can blend in better.

528
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,049
His Majesty and his taste in women.

529
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,134
How is it that
all of you favored concubines

530
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,262
are a mirror image of one another?

531
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,516
Were you all cast in the same mold?

532
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,813
It makes no difference

533
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,900
which side you sit on.

534
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,074
I have a special announcement to make.

535
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:59,204
His Majesty would like to give the princes
a chance to become

536
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,997
the cohort of the Crown Prince

537
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,125
at Sigangwon
through evaluations at Jonghak.

538
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,710
Cohort?

539
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,336
All of a sudden?

540
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,463
This has never happened before.

541
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,632
-This is unexpected.
-My goodness.

542
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:18,056
I hope this selection
will not cause excessive competition.

543
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,935
I especially ask the concubines

544
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,731
to remain calm.

545
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,699
Only those who apply
for the selection shall be evaluated.

546
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,202
If any of you wish to apply,

547
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:43,707
submit your nameplate to Jonghak by
the fifteenth hour the day after tomorrow.

548
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,918
Master, we do not have to
complicate things.

549
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,463
Why not choose Prince Bogeom,
who is top of the class?

550
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,844
Is not the cohort usually selected

551
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,679
among the children of the royals
and the court officials?

552
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,264
Yes.

553
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,434
That has been the case until now.

554
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,936
This is certainly unprecedented.

555
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,482
I wonder why they are selecting
one of the princes this time.

556
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,358
Whatever the reason may be,

557
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,526
I will tell my son to apply

558
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,196
since this is a chance to learn
from the tutor of the Crown Prince.

559
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,573
This is such a rare opportunity.

560
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,617
You are indeed right.

561
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,249
Calm down.

562
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,378
Did you already forget
what Her Majesty said?

563
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,383
When a cow drinks water, it becomes milk.

564
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:40,555
When a snake drinks water,
it becomes poison.

565
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,018
It is too early to tell

566
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,062
whether this is an opportunity

567
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,314
or a trap.

568
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,399
You are right.

569
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,029
Even if they are chosen, the cohort
will only be compared to the Crown Prince.

570
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,866
The cohort is nothing more
than the shadow of the Crown Prince.

571
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,293
Just the thought of my son
becoming a cohort is giving me headaches.

572
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,421
How did the Queen Dowager
make her son the King

573
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:17,175
when she was a mere concubine?

574
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,094
It does not end there.

575
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,472
She even removed all his--

576
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,812
I hear that the competition
was even fiercer then.

577
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,231
Perhaps she had a secret method.

578
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,567
Secret method?

579
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:39,364
I have somewhere to be.
If you will excuse me.

580
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,908
That reminds me.

581
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,871
My father is paying me a visit today.

582
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,833
I will get going too then.

583
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:57,924
Your Majesty.

584
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,886
What is it that you want to know now?

585
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,430
Why are they selecting a cohort
all of a sudden?

586
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,683
What could His Majesty be thinking?

587
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,685
How would I know?

588
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,520
I only follow his decision.

589
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,939
I thought you would.

590
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,526
It is just to find the Crown Prince
someone to study with.

591
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,029
I doubt that many will even apply.

592
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,197
I am sure most of them will apply.

593
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,326
My goodness. You just do not
understand how we concubines think.

594
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,580
Sigangwon has the best scholars in Joseon.

595
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:32,375
It would be a great honor
for anyone to learn from them.

596
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:38,048
By the way, are you not interested
in the cohort selection?

597
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,175
Why would I be?

598
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,135
Are you sure?

599
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:46,181
In that case, would it be okay
if Prince Bogeom applies?

600
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,390
Well…

601
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,560
he is bright indeed.

602
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,021
He would also get along
well with the Crown Prince.

603
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,524
I would be most delighted
if he becomes the new cohort.

604
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,193
Then I will tell him to apply.

605
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,653
Sure.

606
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,905
I give you my blessing.

607
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:09,955
Your Majesty, please slow down.
I have trouble keeping up with you.

608
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,707
Do you intend to follow me
to the banquet? Leave already.

609
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,126
You are so cold.

610
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,837
I beg you to treat me
with the respect you show others.

611
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,923
I stopped being your maid years ago.

612
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,550
It is time you stopped
treating me like one.

613
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,911
I thought your father
was paying you a visit today.

614
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:55,375
You said you had somewhere to be,
Consort Ko.

615
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,502
Well…

616
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:01,047
You must all be here
because of what I said.

617
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,759
You want to know if the Queen Dowager

618
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,595
had any secret methods
in making her son the King.

619
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,766
Would it not be stranger
if we did not want to know?

620
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,480
There is no point in fighting.

621
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,941
We all got here too late.

622
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,945
I realized once again

623
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:28,283
that it is better to be quick
on your feet than to be quick-witted.

624
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,340
I, of course, did have my secret methods.

625
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,013
But my methods are outdated.

626
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,350
And it would be unfair
to the other concubines.

627
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,355
But if you ask me such a thing,

628
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:03,693
you might be suspected
of having an ulterior motive.

629
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,072
Not at all, Your Royal Highness.

630
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,574
It is just to make my son
a cohort at Sigangwon.

631
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:12,494
I do not have any ulterior motives.

632
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:16,831
I believe this is
the opportunity of a lifetime.

633
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,001
Please understand that
I am making this decision as a mother

634
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,921
who wants to provide her son
with a high-quality education.

635
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,758
Like water that has been boiled
one hundred times…

636
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,930
there are some methods
employed by the Crown Prince

637
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,973
that the concubines follow in secret.

638
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:38,645
But surely you must not have thought
that was all there was to it.

639
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,438
There is more.

640
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,775
While the road to bringing up a king
is long and winding,

641
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,904
every step of it is worthwhile.

642
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,369
Prenatal education aside,
the road to becoming the King

643
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:58,206
includes everything from the establishment
of the Office of Tutelage at birth

644
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,167
to learning how to behave
once one is enthroned.

645
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,336
Every little thing one must know…

646
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,799
is included in this book.

647
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,140
Are you…

648
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:19,018
Are you bestowing this book unto me?

649
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,567
That is what I intend to do.

650
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,028
But what can you give me in return,

651
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,366
Consort Tae?

652
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,245
Your Majesty.

653
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:40,665
Please allow Royal Physician
Cho Guk-yeong to treat the Crown Prince.

654
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,750
Royal Physician Cho?

655
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,086
He is away at the moment.

656
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,505
What do you mean?

657
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,508
As my uncle has been suffering
from smallpox,

658
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,678
I sent him to Hamgil-do this afternoon
at Mother's request.

659
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,846
HAMGIL-DO: MODERN-DAY HAMGYONG PROVINCE

660
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,516
I see.

661
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,603
Has the Crown Prince's
skin disease become worse?

662
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,439
In that case, I shall summon
Royal Physician Cho immediately.

663
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,857
No, Your Majesty.

664
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,859
I was hoping that Royal Physician Cho

665
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:11,613
could improve the Crown Prince's
chronic itching.

666
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:15,033
Since he is receiving treatment,
you do not have to worry.

667
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,162
Your Majesty,

668
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,458
why do you wish to select a cohort
among the princes this time?

669
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,169
It was suggested by Mother,

670
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,715
and I thought it would be a nice change.

671
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,802
Her Royal Highness suggested it?

672
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,695
Royal Physician Cho is not in the palace.

673
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,658
Something does not feel right.

674
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,577
It was the Queen Dowager
who sent him away.

675
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:05,250
She is also the one who suggested
selecting a cohort among the princes.

676
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,754
Now that I think of it,

677
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:13,383
Consort Tae did tell me something strange.

678
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,887
She said she received a secret book
from the Queen Dowager.

679
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,974
And that book contains…

680
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,436
secrets behind bringing up a king.

681
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,735
Your Majesty!

682
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,196
Hyeolheogwol?

683
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:22,577
I am familiar with the disease,
and I also know how it ends.

684
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,580
He is being treated.

685
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:30,168
I remember the late Crown Prince Taein
receiving treatment as well.

686
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,169
But in the end,

687
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,006
he died an untimely death.

688
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,843
That is the nature of diseases.

689
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,597
They take one's life out of the blue,

690
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,599
leaving those left behind in panic.

691
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,603
Could that be why?

692
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,360
This thought came to me seeing
the Crown Prince lying unconscious.

693
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,613
What if the Crown Prince dies

694
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,824
and his position as the heir
to the throne becomes vacant?

695
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,952
None of your other sons

696
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,665
are worthy enough to take on his place.

697
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,875
Something along those lines.

698
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,336
It is your grandson…

699
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,172
who is in poor health.

700
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,926
It is not some stranger on the street.

701
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:24,681
I worry more about the future
of my son's nation and my palace

702
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,142
than I worry about him.

703
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,941
You are more concerned with keeping

704
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:38,403
the royal court in order
than the well-being of your grandson?

705
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,740
It is by preventing confusion
in the royal court

706
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,078
that one ensures
the safety of everyone, Your Majesty.

707
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:56,421
If so, why did you suggest
selecting a cohort among the princes?

708
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,720
What are you planning to do?

709
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,389
Your Majesty.

710
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,936
How much longer do you believe
one can last with rotting roots?

711
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,148
The Crown Prince will recover.

712
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,358
Will he?

713
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,862
But what if…

714
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:24,782
he does not?

715
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:30,913
In that case, one of those
troublemakers will ascend the throne

716
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,499
and end up leaving a stain
on the history of the kingdom

717
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,501
just because they are of legitimate birth.

718
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,632
Let me tell you something.

719
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,512
Your only worth in the royal family

720
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,557
is the Crown Prince.

721
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,853
I have been easy on you
since you are the mother of that child.

722
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,397
Therefore…

723
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,150
you should protect

724
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,653
my grandson at all costs.

725
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,706
I am scared.

726
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,168
I fear the Queen Dowager

727
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,504
for the first time
since I entered the palace.

728
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,261
Senior Court Lady Shin.

729
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,054
Yes, Your Majesty.

730
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,767
How long have you been serving me?

731
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,479
I have served you
since you became the Crown Princess,

732
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:22,149
so it has been
a little more than 20 years.

733
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:28,489
Can you tell me what happened?

734
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:35,288
The late Crown Prince Taein
was sickly and died suddenly.

735
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,166
His mother, Queen Yoon, was deposed.

736
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,002
That is everything

737
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:45,840
that I and the people
of this kingdom know of

738
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,217
regarding that incident.

739
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:51,929
Did they go on to choose
a new cohort afterward

740
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:57,018
just like they are doing now?

741
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,604
No, Your Majesty.

742
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:03,316
His Majesty was never a cohort.

743
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:07,320
But he was the son of a concubine.

744
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,822
How was he able to
end up succeeding the throne?

745
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,911
How did Queen Yoon end up
in such a predicament?

746
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,917
You must know since you
served the Queen Dowager then.

747
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,877
Tell me what happened.

748
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,630
That remains…

749
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,134
a secret that the two of them
share to this day.

750
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,347
Do you mean…

751
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,600
the Queen Dowager and Queen Yoon?

752
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:44,857
Her Royal Highness is someone
who would do anything for His Majesty.

753
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:49,278
This is all I can tell you for now.

754
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,045
Have you heard anything
from Consort Hwang?

755
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:49,672
No, Your Royal Highness.

756
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,260
How could she not be interested?

757
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:01,976
Did you give the book
to Consort Tae after all?

758
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,103
I did.

759
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:10,776
But I intend to give one to
all the mothers of promising princes.

760
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,319
Pardon?

761
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:15,990
All the concubines who stood in wait
each deserve a gift.

762
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,787
Deliver these books to their quarters.

763
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,790
Make it seem as if they were
the only ones who received the book

764
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:29,712
so that they may never share
what is written here with anyone else.

765
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,672
And…

766
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:38,637
so that they will swear
their loyalty to me and obey me.

767
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,522
How rude of you.

768
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:14,483
I may be living in hiding,

769
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,486
but that does not give you
the right to appear in my yard

770
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,947
in the middle of the night
without prior notice.

771
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,741
I apologize, Your Highness.

772
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,161
"Your Highness"?

773
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,248
Watch your words.

774
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,543
I have come at such an ungodly hour

775
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:35,171
as there is something
that I urgently need to ask you.

776
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,380
Please leave.

777
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:41,302
Being seen with me alone is enough
to have you charged with treason.

778
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:45,014
You will put not only yourself
but both of us in danger.

779
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,474
-Your Highness.
-My life…

780
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,061
is the only thing

781
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,607
that I managed to protect in the end.

782
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,569
Do not make me risk losing even that.

783
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,154
Leave immediately.

784
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,155
I, too, am here

785
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,742
because I may not be
able to protect my life.

786
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,662
I am scared.

787
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,916
I mustered the courage to stand my ground,

788
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,293
but I do not know
how to protect the things I have.

789
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,439
You know very well what it is like…

790
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:40,236
to not be able to protect

791
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,864
the Crown Prince and the Grand Princes.

792
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,036
I am…

793
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:53,332
nothing more than a failure.

794
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,835
If you could turn back time,

795
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,838
what would you do?

796
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:06,136
I am in the same situation you were in.

797
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,347
From one desperate mother to another,

798
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:13,394
do you not have any
words of advice for me?

799
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,902
What is it that you want to know?

800
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,079
Everything that happened

801
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,332
between the two of you

802
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,543
that no one else
has ever heard or read about.

803
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:40,629
I want to know…

804
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,341
everything that happened then.

805
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:58,647
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

806
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,757
What did you just say?

807
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,093
I would do anything necessary

808
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,554
to protect my children.

809
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,807
Will you keep me company
by my side as my cohort?

810
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:38,854
It has become so fragile now that
even a gentle breeze could make it fall.

811
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:42,649
I will return to you
what is rightfully yours.

812
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:46,070
Grand Prince Gyeseong
has been secretly going somewhere.

813
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,530
Things will become interesting
starting tomorrow.

814
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,200
What should I do?

815
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:56,288
