00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,250
EPISODE 14

3
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,732
Ik-hyeon.

4
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,693
You must…

5
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,739
survive…

6
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,576
at any cost.

7
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,789
Please…

8
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,542
stay healthy.

9
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,049
This is where it ends for us
as father and son.

10
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,009
Go now.

11
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,557
Thank you.

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,227
Not at all, Your Highness.

13
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,646
You must preserve yourself.

14
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,856
You will be seen by others.

15
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,982
Go on now.

16
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,800
Seung-seon.

17
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,679
Serve Her Majesty well.

18
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,222
Yes, Father.

19
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,682
Very well.

20
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,562
Let us go.

21
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,099
Who is the real father of Prince Uiseong?

22
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:52,649
Answer me. Who is the real father
of Prince Uiseong?

23
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,117
You already know.

24
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,288
He is the son of His Majesty.

25
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,570
Did you really think I poisoned this?

26
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,826
Your Royal Highness.

27
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,037
Prince Uiseong

28
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,083
is the first son
His Majesty held in his arms.

29
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,045
He is his firstborn.

30
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,858
"The Crown Prince passed away
in his quarters."

31
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,360
"The King and Official Historian
Park Jung-ho attended

32
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,946
as Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk
conducted the autopsy

33
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,574
and Royal Physician Cho Guk-yeong
wrote the geomsimunan."

34
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,993
GEOMSIMUNAN: AN AUTOPSY REPORT

35
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,498
The record has been destroyed.

36
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,340
Official Historian Park Jung-ho?

37
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,478
My Queen,

38
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,438
what did you just say?

39
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,191
Please reinvestigate the cause of death

40
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,735
of Crown Prince Taein.

41
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,658
The death of our late Crown Prince

42
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,204
is too similar to his death.

43
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,249
Are you saying…

44
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,629
our Crown Prince was murdered?

45
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,341
Yes.

46
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,052
There is such a suspicion.

47
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,223
So I wish to look into the cause
of death of Crown Prince Taein.

48
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,020
I cannot dig into the past
based on mere speculation.

49
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,359
Do you know what it would mean
if Crown Prince Taein was murdered?

50
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,488
It would mean my enthronement
was nothing less than a rebellion.

51
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,324
I have been on the throne
for over 20 years,

52
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:52,120
but I am still surrounded
by those who threaten my authority.

53
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,872
Moreover, there was a suspicion
of Seo Ham-deok's rebellion.

54
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,417
I am yet to find out
who took part in this treason.

55
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,046
You should be
my biggest support, My Queen.

56
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,756
Why do you…

57
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,676
raise such a suspicion?

58
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,264
I am not here to raise suspicion.

59
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,184
I am simply trying to find out

60
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,353
how our son died.

61
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,106
If…

62
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,526
he was really murdered,

63
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,697
I need to know why he had to die

64
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,534
and who took his life.

65
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,664
I must know.

66
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,837
I will not allow it.

67
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,758
If the Crown Prince was truly murdered,
I will look into it in another way.

68
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,680
But I will not allow the reinvestigation

69
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,474
of the death of Crown Prince Taein.

70
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,523
Seungjeongwon ilgi was tampered with?

71
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,816
Yes.

72
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,861
The problem is, only the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein is gone.

73
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,071
It was suspicious enough

74
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,949
that all the records were destroyed
by the fire in the Royal Clinic.

75
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,785
But the record
in the Royal Secretariat is also gone?

76
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,622
I am certain someone tried to conceal it.

77
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,582
Who could it be?

78
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,003
Someone who is afraid
that the report will come to light.

79
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,797
It seems all the records of that day
are gone now.

80
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,135
No.

81
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,430
There may be remains…

82
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,185
of gajangsacho, the first draft
kept by an official historian.

83
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,772
GAJANGSACHO: THE FIRST DRAFT
OF SECRET AFFAIRS AND PERSONAL REMARKS

84
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,357
You know the name
of the official historian

85
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,192
who attended the autopsy.

86
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,069
Do you know of

87
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,655
Official Historian Park Jung-ho?

88
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,077
He is the father of Lord Park Gyeong-u.

89
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,454
Did you…

90
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,916
just say gajangsacho?

91
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,254
Yes.

92
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,341
Have you read the gajangsacho
left behind by your late father?

93
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,220
Back then,

94
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,181
did you leave me

95
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,934
because of that gajangsacho?

96
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,398
Did you summon me back to the palace

97
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,192
because of that?

98
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,714
What are you planning
to do about Prince Uiseong?

99
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,008
I shall let him live.

100
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,136
Do you know

101
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,223
why I let one of the children
of the deposed Queen Yoon live?

102
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,479
When your children die one after another,
and only one is left,

103
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,524
you live every single day

104
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,695
in complete anxiety and torment,
worrying that you may lose that one too.

105
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,906
What is more dreadful

106
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,452
than losing your child

107
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,623
is that you cannot kill yourself
because of the child you still have.

108
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,542
Therefore,

109
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,754
if I kill Prince Uiseong right away,

110
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,257
the pain will end

111
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,302
a little too early for Consort Hwang.

112
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,430
For now,

113
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,060
I do need to know
who the real father of Prince Uiseong is.

114
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,812
Look into that.

115
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,360
Do you mean there is no record at all?

116
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,028
That is right.

117
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,284
The evidence to prove
Crown Prince Taein was murdered by poison…

118
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,204
no longer exists.

119
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,292
Therefore,

120
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:14,090
we must stop our investigation
of the cause of his death.

121
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,011
Instead,

122
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,889
there is one thing I need you to do.

123
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,644
Find the poison
that killed my late Crown Prince.

124
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,564
It does not react to silver.

125
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,942
When taken orally,

126
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,486
it causes balban in the mouth.

127
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,904
BALBAN: BRUISING AND PETECHIAE

128
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,659
Pick out the most likely ones
and bring them to me.

129
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,665
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,380
What happened?

131
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,590
The records of Seungjeongwon
were also damaged.

132
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,386
Damaged?

133
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,680
Do you think

134
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,434
it was also the King's doing?

135
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,399
The only hope we have left is…

136
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,654
to find the original draft of the
autopsy report of Crown Prince Taein.

137
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,241
It is not like I do not know that.

138
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,495
We searched through the Royal Clinic
and the home of Cho Guk-yeong,

139
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,914
but we were unable to find it.

140
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,960
The Chief State Councilor
may have it already.

141
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,087
Chief State Councilor?

142
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:41,469
Therefore, we must get him
to stand on our side.

143
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,599
Have you decided?

144
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,439
I cannot bring down

145
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,067
the King I enthroned myself.

146
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,072
So Prince Uiseong, you must stop here.

147
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,576
Stop here?

148
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,788
-I cannot do that.
-Prince Uiseong!

149
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,459
Lying around in a fancy residence
after receiving 180 gyeol of land

150
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,169
made me become even firmer on this.

151
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,005
I must return to the palace.

152
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,717
I said I will do what I can
to make it happen.

153
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,260
Do you still not get it?

154
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,013
Your influence in the palace
has also changed.

155
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,810
That may be true, but this is wrong.

156
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,606
Have you forgotten
how your mother raised you?

157
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,194
Your ambition could put her in danger!

158
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,780
She gave me her permission.

159
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:58,337
When your child takes the wrong path,
it is a duty of a parent to correct it.

160
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,423
You must stop Prince Uiseong
before things get out of hand.

161
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,551
It is too late.

162
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,640
Do you not know what happens
to the rebels if the rebellion fails?

163
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,351
I would rather die
than live in this humiliation.

164
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,435
Cho-yeon!

165
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,527
Prince Uiseong is not the son of the King.

166
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,280
What?

167
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,992
The Queen Dowager
also seems to be aware of this.

168
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,292
If the King finds out about this,

169
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:41,130
not only will my life be in danger,
but also yours and Prince Uiseong's.

170
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,220
Why did you wish to see me?

171
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,309
Have you seen the gajangsacho,
the first draft, your father put together

172
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,312
in the year of his death?

173
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,401
I apologize,

174
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,905
but my father did not leave
any gajangsacho.

175
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,740
So please,

176
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,952
I ask you not to call for me
over such a matter from now on.

177
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,414
Someone has tampered
with Seungjeongwon ilgi.

178
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,542
So…

179
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,964
the only remaining record of that day

180
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,885
is in the gajangsacho
your father put together.

181
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,970
I have

182
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,098
never seen that draft.

183
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,813
I heard your father suddenly passed

184
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,026
not long after he attended
the autopsy of Crown Prince Taein.

185
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,987
Do you think…

186
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,658
that is a coincidence?

187
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,787
Even if his gajangsacho is left behind,

188
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,873
if he chose to hide it even as he passed,

189
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,708
would it not be

190
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,254
the truth he tried to hide until the end?

191
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,173
What if it is

192
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,345
the record he tried to protect
at the cost of his life?

193
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,081
It has been a while, my lord.

194
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,385
Yoo Sang-uk.

195
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,596
How are you still…

196
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,973
Yes, I am somehow still alive.

197
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,934
I do, however,
look a bit ragged, thanks to you.

198
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,188
What is it?

199
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,858
Are you shocked that the man
whom you were sure you had killed

200
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,735
is sitting before you?

201
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,738
There is no reason
to bicker over the past.

202
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,031
Let us get to the point.

203
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,908
Very well, then.

204
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,368
Chief State Councilor, since you are here,

205
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:03,082
may I take it
as your agreement to join us?

206
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,170
Let me ask you before I answer.

207
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,381
Is the King you wish to enthrone

208
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,676
Grand Prince Yeongwon, Yi Ik-hyeon?

209
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,096
Yes.

210
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,519
You are right.

211
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,902
You must stop the interrogation.

212
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,197
Do not hurt him.
Do not tell him that you know.

213
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,824
Are you sure

214
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,034
we can trust him?

215
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,168
Prince Uiseong is not the son of the King.

216
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,714
Yi Ik-hyeon?

217
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,008
Is he not the younger brother
of Crown Prince Taein?

218
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,180
The fact that Physician Kwon
is in league with Yoo Sang-uk

219
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,350
means he is also tied to Yi Ik-hyeon.

220
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,189
I know Physician Kwon
was involved in poisoning Brother.

221
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,526
If your assumption is right,

222
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,529
Father might become…

223
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,240
their next target.

224
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,037
Who do you think Physician Kwon is?

225
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,916
Perhaps,

226
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,213
it may not be that Physician Kwon
was abetted by Consort Hwang.

227
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,634
He may be using Consort Hwang.

228
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,897
If Grand Prince Yeongwon
is the one you wish to enthrone,

229
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,983
why would he let me live?

230
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,655
If you provide useful information to him,

231
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,783
he may guarantee your safety.

232
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,832
When Crown Prince Taein passed away,

233
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,669
the current King was there.

234
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,990
If the rebellion succeeds,

235
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,993
can you testify to what you just said?

236
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,538
If you can guarantee

237
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,085
the safety of my life and the position
of Prince Uiseong in the palace,

238
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
then I will testify.

239
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,095
It looks like there is more
you want from me.

240
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,015
What do you really want from me?

241
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,811
I am sure you have a good reason
why you wish to bring me into this.

242
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,985
The autopsy report of Crown Prince Taein.

243
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,822
Give us the original draft of the report.

244
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,783
Why are you asking me for that?

245
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,828
We searched the surroundings
of Cho Guk-yeong

246
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,955
and all of the Royal Clinic
but found nothing.

247
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,875
So I figured you were the only one

248
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,169
who would have it.

249
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,921
I do not have it.

250
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,426
Cho Guk-yeong, that sly man,
would not have hidden it just anywhere.

251
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,555
He used to be a mere assistant to you.

252
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,766
How do you think he became
a minister-level official?

253
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,561
Cho Guk-yeong was the one

254
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:57,065
who killed Crown Prince Taein
on the orders of the Queen Dowager.

255
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,528
Why do you think
she let him live to this day?

256
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:07,409
I am sure he prepared
for what was to come to save himself.

257
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,830
Are you saying

258
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,750
the gajangsacho was left behind?

259
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,876
Yes.

260
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,544
However,

261
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,174
it includes content
I cannot show you, Your Majesty.

262
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,219
I ask you to just let it go.

263
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,721
I cannot do that.

264
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,015
If I let this go,

265
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,102
then the truth of that day
may disappear forever.

266
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,689
If

267
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,734
Official Historian Park Jung-ho passed
because of that record,

268
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,031
then the truth he wanted to leave
as a historian until the end

269
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,451
must be included in that draft.

270
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,120
Please,

271
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,500
tell me the truth of that day,
the truth someone tried to conceal.

272
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,925
Your Majesty.

273
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,722
There is a person and incident involved
that you cannot handle.

274
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,231
Do you still wish to see it?

275
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,447
Yes.

276
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,120
I need to find the truth
behind the death of my late Crown Prince.

277
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,872
So I must know…

278
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,709
the truth of that day.

279
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,338
I ask of you.

280
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,176
I have a request to make as well.

281
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,848
Do not tell anybody

282
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,517
what is written in the gajangsacho.

283
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,232
If you keep that promise,
I will show it to you, Your Majesty.

284
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,490
I promise.

285
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,098
His mouth is filled with balban,
bruising and petechiae.

286
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,131
What killed him?

287
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,633
I regret to inform you

288
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,053
that hyeolheogwol does not
seem to be the cause of his death.

289
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,097
What are your grounds?

290
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,558
There was balban in his mouth,

291
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,727
and his throat was severely swollen.

292
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,272
Also, the wounds on his chest
did not exist before,

293
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,900
and there are bloodstains under his nails.

294
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,694
He must have scratched himself in pain

295
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,864
after he was poisoned,
which caused these wounds.

296
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,701
Do you mean
that my Crown Prince was murdered?

297
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,373
There was no reaction to indicate poison.

298
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,793
The poison could be something
that does not react to beopmul.

299
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,503
BEOPMUL: TOOL USED
TO DETECT POISON DURING AUTOPSY

300
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,796
I cannot be sure,

301
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,925
but we cannot disregard
the possibility he was poisoned.

302
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,561
If you are not sure, then it is not true.

303
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,149
Do not look into the cause of his death.

304
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,196
Do not record anything that happened here.

305
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,909
The cause of death of the Crown Prince

306
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,245
is hyeolheogwol.

307
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,464
Right after the late King
left the examination,

308
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,341
he met with Prince Geumyeong.

309
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,266
And he was soon crowned
as the Crown Prince.

310
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,652
Prince Geumyeong…

311
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,155
is His Majesty.

312
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,823
Does this mean

313
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,451
His Majesty…

314
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,288
was aware that Crown Prince Taein

315
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,750
was poisoned to death?

316
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,447
Crown Princess.

317
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,493
Rumors say you are yet to consummate
your marriage with the Crown Prince.

318
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,036
Is it true?

319
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,582
I apologize.

320
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,129
I will bring you good news soon,
so please do not worry.

321
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,298
By any chance,

322
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:41,761
is the Crown Prince avoiding you?

323
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,847
Avoiding me?

324
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,684
He is just busy carrying out his duties

325
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,436
as the Crown Prince.

326
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,814
Bearing a son to succeed him

327
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,151
is the most important duty
of the Crown Prince.

328
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,070
Have I not told you?

329
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:03,032
I am worried about him
because he has not secured his position

330
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,909
as the Crown Prince.

331
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,163
He must be evaluated thoroughly

332
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,998
for everything he does

333
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,542
and tested every second
until he is enthroned.

334
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,794
If he shows any deficiency,

335
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,088
he can be replaced at any time.

336
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,466
That is the reality
of the position of the Crown Prince.

337
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,469
Why would he be replaced
when he was just crowned?

338
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,430
Even if he shows any deficiency,

339
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,766
please shield him, Your Royal Highness.

340
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,226
Crown Princess.

341
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:35,315
It would not be to his benefit
to shield him blindly.

342
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,445
There is a rumor in the palace
that he is infertile.

343
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:45,116
Do you not realize
how fatal that is to him?

344
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,745
I will put an end to that rumor.

345
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,464
Please let Her Majesty know
that I am here.

346
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,134
Your Majesty.

347
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,512
Please set a date for our consummation.

348
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,516
I have a plan,
so please wait, Crown Princess.

349
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,142
I have no time to wait.

350
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,895
What is the matter?

351
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,064
I visited the Queen Dowager just now.

352
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,151
The Queen Dowager was quite
inquisitive about the consummation.

353
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,737
I understand that she is worried,

354
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,741
but it seemed like
this could harm His Royal Highness.

355
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,414
And I wish to become closer to him.

356
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,166
After all, we are married.

357
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,752
However,

358
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,630
I have no way of fathoming
what is in his mind.

359
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,680
Could you tell me about him, Your Majesty?

360
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,808
In that case,

361
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,478
there are people
who can tell you more than I can.

362
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,565
Has His Royal Highness
always been brusque?

363
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,566
-Yes.
-Yes.

364
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,193
And does he rarely express himself?

365
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,865
Right, what does he like to eat?

366
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,618
I think he likes everything
that is made with meat.

367
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,621
No, he likes greens
such as bracken and bean sprouts.

368
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,039
I see.

369
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,001
So he is not a picky eater
and eats a balanced diet.

370
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,421
It will take some time,

371
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,381
but I am sure you two will become closer.

372
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,510
He may seem brusque and cold,

373
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,889
but he is actually
the most warmhearted among us.

374
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,515
He is right.

375
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,602
If you meet him more often,
you will grow closer sooner.

376
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,606
And if he keeps giving you a hard time,
just let us know.

377
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,274
We are on your side.

378
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,586
A crown princess who visits
the quarters of a grand prince

379
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,590
before she consummates her marriage
with the Crown Prince?

380
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,386
I am glad.

381
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,432
The more preposterous a rumor is,
the better.

382
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,352
However, Your Royal Highness,

383
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,439
other Grand Princes were also visiting
the quarters of Grand Prince Muan.

384
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,776
It seems like
something is going on with him.

385
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,030
Keep your eyes on his quarters.

386
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,910
Your Majesty.

387
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,244
I have bad news.

388
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,997
There is a rumor in the palace

389
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,125
-that the Crown Prince is a hwaja.
-What?

390
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,170
Hwaja?

391
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,714
A problem with his reproductive organs?

392
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,051
There is also an atrocious rumor
that the Crown Princess

393
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,220
cannot deal with her loneliness

394
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,973
and visits the quarters
of Grand Prince Muan.

395
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,769
That is absurd!

396
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,647
The rumor started from the Queen Dowager.

397
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,982
I cannot let this go on.

398
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,274
Court Lady Oh.

399
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,193
Summon the Crown Prince and Princess now.

400
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,486
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:18,037
What about the baby?
Was there a rumor about the baby?

402
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:59,245
I heard a crying sound,
so I went over and looked.

403
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,708
There was a kitten crying.

404
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,210
So I grabbed it and brought it here.

405
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,133
Goodness, what are you doing?

406
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,218
-You surprised me.
-Did I?

407
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,178
Do not slap me.

408
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,647
Come in.

409
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,247
Greetings.

410
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,832
I am a nursemaid.

411
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,043
As of today,

412
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,547
she will help you two
through the consummation of marriage.

413
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,466
Your Majesty.

414
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,428
I will return your trust
with a result greater than you expected.

415
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,056
I am aware of who you are.

416
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,643
You have never failed once. Is that true?

417
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,523
Yes.

418
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,275
You can count on me.

419
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,913
We will implement an emergency system
until their consummation.

420
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,498
Do you understand?

421
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,666
-Yes.
-Yes.

422
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,167
The first day of consummation

423
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,253
is the day the energy of yang
fills the air

424
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,548
and even eunuchs have difficulty sleeping.

425
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,801
It is in two days,
the fifteenth of this month.

426
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:40,179
The hour will be midnight and the location
will be the quarters of the Crown Prince.

427
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,305
Crown Prince's delegate.

428
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:45,560
How well does His Royal Highness
know about sexual matters?

429
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,436
He is aware of the theory,

430
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,106
but he does not seem
to have actual experience.

431
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,817
And he does not show
much interest in women,

432
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,987
so his sexual desire does not seem strong.

433
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,614
Does he not have any physical problems?

434
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,825
He is completely normal.

435
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,118
I check every morning.

436
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,619
Crown Princess' delegate.

437
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,914
How well does Her Royal Highness
know about sexual matters?

438
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,793
She knows everything there is to know,
so there is nothing left to teach her.

439
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,628
Above all, she is fervent.

440
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,755
What is more important than fervor

441
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,924
is to awaken their instinct.

442
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,726
What is this?

443
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,437
People usually say eel, chive, peanut,

444
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,731
watermelon, raw octopus,
and tuber fleece flower

445
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:35,484
help fill a man's energy as aphrodisiacs.

446
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,111
But they are all useless.

447
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,322
This is all you need.

448
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,909
This is freshwater eel extract
made with water filtered with red clay.

449
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,912
Please drink up.

450
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,424
You drink it.

451
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,927
Your Royal Highness.

452
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,597
May I inform Her Majesty?

453
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:23,074
Soak all the way in the water
until you are saturated with the scent.

454
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,874
What is this? It smells delightful.

455
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,168
It is medicinal water with white daphne.

456
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,586
White daphne?

457
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,255
Yes.

458
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,465
Its scent is said to travel 1,000 ri,

459
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,009
so it is also called the 1,000 ri flower.

460
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,805
It reminds one of a flowery path
drenched in summer mist

461
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,015
and intoxicates them.

462
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,652
This is a way of training
the muscles in his lower body

463
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,737
between the lower back, thigh, and pelvis.

464
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,574
It helps with circulation
and awakens intrinsic instincts.

465
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,618
You must go down lower.

466
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,871
Hold out just a little longer.

467
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,166
Your marriage will be consummated
tonight at midnight

468
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,836
when the moon is full.

469
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,313
The lovemaking between a man and a woman
comes down to the mood.

470
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,774
Tilt the mattress a little more.

471
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,453
If you keep this on you,
you will give off a sweet smell.

472
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,000
Please lie down on the outside

473
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,210
to keep the energy of yang inside.

474
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,591
This is a wedding drink.

475
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,469
It will help
with the awkwardness and tension.

476
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,475
Prepare to receive His Royal Highness.

477
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,559
-Yes.
-Yes.

478
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:03,234
There is still
hansikgyeong left until midnight.

479
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,985
HANSIKGYEONG: ABOUT HALF AN HOUR

480
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:05,986
Yes.

481
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,157
What should we do until then?

482
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,914
This is a wedding drink.

483
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,792
It will help
with the awkwardness and tension.

484
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,670
Would you like to have a drink,
Your Royal Highness?

485
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,472
Although I get drunk easily…

486
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,695
Your Royal Highness.

487
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:53,242
I want us to be comfortable with each
other like how we were on Manwol Island.

488
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:04,855
Your Majesty.

489
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,815
What is the matter?

490
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,277
At the time of the Crown Prince's death,
Physician Kwon was imprisoned.

491
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,031
I am sure he used another way

492
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,659
in addition to the poison.

493
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,620
What do you reckon it was?

494
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,291
There is one thing I am suspicious of.

495
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,008
When the needle is inserted
deep into the gimunhyeol,

496
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,719
it can hurt the organ and cause bleeding.

497
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,975
My Crown Prince suffered from hyeolu,
where his blood did not clot properly,

498
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,102
so it must have been fatal.

499
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,271
His internal bleeding must have persisted.

500
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,484
In order to prove
all my assumptions are true,

501
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,112
I must find

502
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,115
the poison Physician Kwon used.

503
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,366
However,

504
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:00,035
do you think he will bring the poison?

505
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,457
She told me to bring her the poison.

506
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,294
It seems like
the Queen is suspicious of me.

507
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,005
You must be cautious.

508
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:15,342
Everything will be over if your identity
gets exposed, Your Highness.

509
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,265
So how did it go?

510
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,769
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince
and the Crown Princess

511
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,105
have spent the night together.

512
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,150
What a relief.

513
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,237
I can finally stop worrying about them.

514
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,030
It truly is great news.

515
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,865
I was quite worried.

516
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,742
Goodness.

517
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,374
They spent the night together?

518
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,792
What if

519
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,504
the Crown Princess gives birth to a son?

520
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,340
Would it not be difficult
to throw her out of the palace?

521
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,692
Did we really…

522
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,778
sleep together

523
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,738
last night?

524
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,909
We were together, and we slept.

525
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,454
No, that is not what I meant.

526
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,165
-Did we…
-Do it?

527
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,586
What do you take me for?

528
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,837
Since we were drunk…

529
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,800
I thought about it for a moment,

530
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,762
but I did not want to spend
our first night together that way.

531
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,475
But I did take a look.

532
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,519
Did you…

533
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,104
look at my body?

534
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,025
-Have you gone crazy?
-I checked because I am not.

535
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,193
Crown Princess!

536
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,111
There is a rumor that you are a hwaja.

537
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,157
I had to check if the rumors were true.

538
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,867
It is an important matter.

539
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:33,373
Other married people see and do
all kinds of things between themselves.

540
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,459
Why must we live otherwise?

541
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,213
Besides, I looked at something
I am allowed to as a wife.

542
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,006
Is that a problem?

543
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,759
Please consider it
a confirmation procedure as a wife.

544
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,970
I do not want to do it like this.

545
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,264
Then how shall we do it?

546
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,559
No married couple
exchanges permission to sleep together.

547
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,436
It happens when the sparks go off.

548
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,855
I must go.

549
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,945
Were you afraid you spent the night
with a woman you do not love?

550
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:14,039
I also do not want to be with someone
who dislikes me.

551
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,415
I do not dislike…

552
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,423
What did you just say?

553
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,467
Nothing.

554
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,489
What is it, Your Royal Highness?

555
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,199
Nothing.

556
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,576
Let us go.

557
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,800
Who?

558
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:10,429
There was a physician who came by
Consort Hwang's parents' home often.

559
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,765
And the young assistant of the physician
was Physician Kwon.

560
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,767
Did you just say…

561
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,812
Physician Kwon?

562
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,522
Yes.

563
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,649
How ridiculous.

564
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,444
The father of Prince Uiseong…

565
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,363
is a lowly physician?

566
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,118
Where is he right now?

567
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,078
He has returned to the palace.

568
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,166
The Queen summoned him back.

569
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,876
The Queen?

570
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,218
The first one is water boiled
with poison fire coral.

571
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,138
Next, highly saline salt water.

572
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,265
Lastly,

573
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,226
a poison made with dried
and powdered innards of blowfish.

574
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,525
I am sure the Queen will think…

575
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,863
that I will hide the poison.

576
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,827
Are you saying

577
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:02,958
you will expose the poison you used
on the late Crown Prince?

578
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:07,045
That way, the Queen will waste her time
finding the real poison.

579
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,826
Good work.

580
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,401
One of these may be the poison
he used to kill the Crown Prince.

581
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,569
Pardon?

582
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,240
Physician Kwon is a clever man.

583
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,825
So…

584
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,661
he may have brought

585
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:26,583
the poison he used
in order to rid himself of my suspicion.

586
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,045
Your Majesty.

587
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,005
Won-pyeong has arrived.

588
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,381
Come in.

589
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,306
Your Majesty,
there is something you must see.

590
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,391
You must hurry to Hyewolgak.

591
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,441
She took her own life
due to the grief of her circumstances.

592
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,401
The wounds on her chest

593
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,404
are very similar
to the ones you showed me.

594
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,958
In addition to that,

595
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,336
there are signs of balban,
bruising and petechiae, in her mouth.

596
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,966
What did she take?

597
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,093
Bring it over.

598
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,557
What is this?

599
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,933
It is gansu.

600
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,310
GANSU: SALTY AND BITTER WATER
THAT MELTS NATURALLY FROM MOIST SALT

601
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,687
Gansu…

602
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,570
DISINFECTED THE AFFECTED AREA
OF SKIN DISEASE WITH GANSU

603
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,438
This is it.

604
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,236
The poison that killed
the late Crown Prince.

605
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,073
It was gansu.

606
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:51,436
What did you just feed me?

607
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,814
This is the method you used,
Physician Cho Guk-yeong.

608
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,525
Have you forgotten already?

609
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,574
You are right.

610
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,953
I added some gansu.

611
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:19,464
It is clear my son was murdered.

612
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,998
Please trust me, Your Majesty.

613
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,876
His Royal Highness definitely passed
due to hyeolheogwol.

614
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,379
All I want

615
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,425
is the safety of my old mother.

616
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,803
By the way, Your Majesty,

617
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,513
his neighbors said

618
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,640
Physician Kwon
does not have an old mother.

619
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,385
Your son…

620
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,391
Where is the real Yi Ik-hyeon…

621
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,104
right now?

622
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,202
Where is the original draft
of Crown Prince Taein's autopsy report?

623
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,537
If you give it to me, I will let you live.

624
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,372
The autopsy report?

625
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,290
Yes.

626
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,584
I must retrieve it

627
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:23,630
to prove that my older brother
was poisoned to death by gansu.

628
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,634
Are you…

629
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,345
Have you finally figured it out?

630
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,521
I am the younger brother
of Crown Prince Taein, whom you killed.

631
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,899
I am Grand Prince Yeongwon.

632
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,821
Yi Ik-hyeon…

633
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,783
has killed my late Crown Prince.

634
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,079
Were you aware…

635
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,625
that your son poisoned my son…

636
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,712
to death?

637
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,675
I was not.

638
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,678
However,

639
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,682
even if I had known,

640
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,644
-I would not have stopped him.
-No.

641
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,979
You should have.

642
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,984
How many more must die and be sacrificed?

643
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,320
The Queen Dowager started this.

644
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,072
So why?

645
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,284
Why must I…

646
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,204
stop it?

647
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,874
Yi Ik-hyeon…

648
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,881
may not stop at killing the Crown Prince.

649
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,927
How are you alive?

650
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,557
I was dying to know
why my brother suddenly passed.

651
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,934
So I learned medicine
from Physician Yoo Sang-uk.

652
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,730
Also, a physician is the only one
who can touch the royal family.

653
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,525
Let me live.

654
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,486
Please let me live.

655
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,327
You know very well
that you will not survive

656
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,370
after drinking gansu.

657
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,296
Everything was plotted
by the Queen Dowager.

658
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:33,009
I only did as she ordered!

659
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,388
I am sure you only did as you were told.

660
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,683
So tell me where the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein is.

661
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,809
Now.

662
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,479
Then I will give you this antidote.

663
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,234
I hid it in the floor
of the archives of the Royal Clinic.

664
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,194
I have marked the place.

665
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:54,948
Please give me the antidote now.

666
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,795
I wanted to kill you…

667
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,508
the same way you killed my brother.

668
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,051
You…

669
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:32,754
Physician Kwon.

670
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,804
Are you looking for the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein?

671
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,863
Yes, I am.

672
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,950
What brings you here, Your Majesty?

673
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,374
You already know

674
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,961
why I am standing here before you.

675
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,761
I finally found out who killed my son.

676
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,474
Yi Ik-hyeon.

677
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,600
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

678
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,677
There is not long until the rebellion.

679
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,555
How is this in your hands?

680
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,432
It has been a while.

681
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,142
Who do you think

682
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,019
will be next?

683
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,813
Tell Prince Uiseong
to remain in his residence for now.

684
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,065
Is there something wrong
with the Crown Princess?

685
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,526
Hand over Physician Kwon to me.

686
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,780
Once you have the autopsy report,
kill him immediately.

687
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,824
I see people do not change.

688
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,411
It is over, Your Majesty.

689
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:17,210
