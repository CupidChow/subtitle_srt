1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,751
EPISODE 11

3
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,553
PRINCE UISEONG,
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM, PRINCE BOGEOM

4
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,850
You have come far by showing
great performance during the contest.

5
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,727
I am proud of all of you.

6
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,815
Traditionally,

7
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,776
the King selects talent through chaekmun,

8
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,947
for the philosophies and beliefs
of the future leaders of the royal court

9
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,074
are found in their answers.

10
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,702
If you were the King,

11
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,621
what kind of questions
regarding texts and politics

12
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,207
would you ask to select the best talent?

13
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,297
I would ask why the King ordered
Park Gyeong-u and Seo Ham-deok,

14
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,218
who denied the current dynasty,
to be brought to the palace.

15
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,143
I would ask whether someone

16
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,729
who is competent yet immoral
should be appointed to office

17
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,358
to find out what is more valued
between morality and competence.

18
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,071
I would ask what kind of criticism

19
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,657
the candidate heard
about the King outside the palace.

20
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,002
Do you intend to accuse the people?

21
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,047
Do you not know it is a grave crime
to speak ill of the King?

22
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,593
It is to hear the voices of the people
that have not reached the King.

23
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,388
If the people complain about the King
despite their fear,

24
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,975
it means their suffering is unbearable.

25
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,727
So?

26
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,188
Did you hear anyone speak ill of me
outside the palace?

27
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,232
Yes, Your Majesty.

28
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,027
"An excessive amount of usury
is collected from the poor

29
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,487
only to increase the wealth of the nobles,

30
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,074
but the King is only trying
not to upset the court officials."

31
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,828
"If the King does not understand
the suffering of the people,

32
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,080
he is no better than a puppet."

33
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,211
They were complaining about Uichang.

34
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,464
UICHANG: AN ORGANIZATION
THAT STORED EXCESS GRAINS FOR RELIEF

35
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,216
An organization that was established
to benefit the people

36
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,719
is only inflicting suffering on them?

37
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,803
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,391
Uichang, the Righteous Granaries,
was established to help those in need.

39
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,062
However, it became corrupt long ago.

40
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,108
I am glad you brought that up.

41
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,611
I would like you to discuss

42
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,155
what caused the degeneration of Uichang

43
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,657
and how to improve

44
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,700
the situation.

45
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,844
What is the matter?

46
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,099
His Majesty ordered this material
to be included in the assessment.

47
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,976
Please deliver it to the scholars.

48
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,985
Submit it.

49
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,740
What?

50
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,535
His Majesty submitted
more material to be assessed?

51
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,953
Yes, Lord Hwang.

52
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,165
But the behaviors of the scholars
seemed unusual.

53
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,460
While pretending not to be involved,

54
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,839
His Majesty must be evaluating
the candidates in secret.

55
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,176
No one knows how the additional material
will affect the assessment.

56
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,223
You are here.

57
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,561
Did you find out?

58
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,605
Who is in the lead?

59
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,942
The additional material
must have had an impact on it.

60
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,986
Just tell me already.

61
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,779
Who is ahead?

62
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,364
Grand Prince Seongnam.

63
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,538
He must have achieved good results
in the secret evaluation of His Majesty.

64
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,583
At this rate,

65
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,837
he may really become the Crown Prince.

66
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,881
Your Majesty.

67
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:46,095
I hope the scholars will remain impartial
and make fair judgments until the end.

68
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,058
I trust their integrity.

69
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,103
After all, it is to select
their future king.

70
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,023
They will certainly make
a prudent decision.

71
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,153
By the way,

72
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,200
no one is allowed to have any contact
with the scholars.

73
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,828
So by what means

74
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,873
was this information obtained?

75
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,710
Grand Prince Seongnam is ahead?

76
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,254
Are you going to just sit back?

77
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,341
Prince Bogeom will lose at this rate.

78
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,968
Should you not do something?

79
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,888
Then,

80
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:34,102
I will try to persuade the fathers of
the scholars who have remained neutral.

81
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,520
Before that,

82
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,272
there is someone you need to meet.

83
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,861
We need to make that person
stand on our side.

84
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,157
May I ask what this is about?

85
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,036
You are the Ijojeongrang who has control
over the Three Censorate Offices.

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,579
So is it not obvious?

87
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,458
IJOJEONGRANG: SECTION CHIEF
OF THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL

88
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,418
WHO HAS THE RIGHT OF APPOINTMENT

89
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,797
This is a gift from the Queen Dowager.

90
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,257
Please open it.

91
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,017
Her Royal Highness believes

92
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,021
this is the least you deserve.

93
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,612
Stand on the side
of the Queen Dowager this time,

94
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,282
and your sons will be appointed to office.

95
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,873
Most personnel matters are decided by
those serving the Chief State Councilor.

96
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,834
So how can I trust what you say?

97
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,172
In case you were anxious,

98
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,799
I invited another guest.

99
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,514
This is the Ijojeongrang.

100
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,565
You will all hear good news
when there are personnel changes.

101
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,617
The Ijojeongrang must be up to something.

102
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,162
He is said to be supporting Prince Bogeom
along with Minister Yoon.

103
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,956
Is that right?

104
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:26,255
I always knew he would betray us
at some point anyway.

105
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,841
Still,

106
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,094
in this manner?

107
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,014
Why did you want to see me?

108
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,898
As the Deputy Minister
of the Ministry of Justice,

109
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:48,861
I reckon you deserve to own
some of the best lands in the capital.

110
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,326
I cannot give you anything in return

111
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,121
nor can I betray the Queen Dowager.

112
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,041
No, you should never betray
Her Royal Highness.

113
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,294
All I ask is that you help me

114
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,089
find my dog that ran away.

115
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,426
No one is more suited for the task
than you are.

116
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,012
And who knows?

117
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,139
If Prince Uiseong is crowned,

118
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,602
this deal may prove
to be an opportunity for you.

119
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:43,791
You have been accused of corruption
by the Office of the Inspector General.

120
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,421
The Ministry of Justice
is aware of it as well.

121
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:53,968
I called you here to ask you something
before the investigation begins.

122
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,099
Is it really true

123
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,227
that you embezzled that much?

124
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,901
I have turned a blind eye
to your misdemeanors so far

125
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,905
since I believed you were on my side.

126
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,700
But rumor has it

127
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,871
that you went so far as to accept a gift
from the Queen Dowager.

128
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,169
Were you intending
to betray me or something?

129
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,588
My apologies.

130
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,381
Forgive me, Chief State Councilor!

131
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,428
One side won them over
with land and government posts,

132
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,389
while the other threatened them
with corruption charges.

133
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,059
A total tug-of-war is underway,
Your Majesty.

134
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,019
Your Majesty,

135
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,396
should we not do something as well?

136
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,107
Why are you not stopping them?

137
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,321
It is advantageous for us

138
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,783
to let them compete against each other.

139
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:03,287
Then are you deliberately
letting them go against each other?

140
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,373
Yes.

141
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,879
If the votes are split
between Prince Uiseong and Prince Bogeom,

142
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,549
Grand Prince Seongnam

143
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,636
may benefit from it.

144
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,346
However,

145
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,140
in addition to leaking information,

146
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,852
the scholars are now even
receiving messages from their fathers.

147
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,606
It will surely have an impact
on the evaluation.

148
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,652
By the way, Uncle,
how do they exchange messages

149
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,863
under such tight security?

150
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,971
What took you so long?

151
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,557
There were too many eyes,
so I had to take a different way.

152
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,434
You may leave.

153
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,359
Step aside. I will do it.

154
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,361
No.

155
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,947
I could do worse
than search through excretions

156
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,866
to make Prince Bogeom the Crown Prince.

157
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,329
There it is.

158
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:39,884
With Prince Uiseong gaining more support,
Prince Bogeom is falling behind.

159
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,595
Prince Bogeom is falling behind?
That is impossible!

160
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,972
It is possible.

161
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,100
I bet Prince Uiseong
will take the lead soon.

162
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,479
Why? What is the reason
he is gaining support?

163
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,607
What else?
He must have offered the best bribes.

164
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,611
Well…

165
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,280
Would there be a way to turn the tables?

166
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,410
Are you sure that will work?

167
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,789
Yes. This is the only way
to get the scholars to turn their backs.

168
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,184
I do not know whose idea it was,

169
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:35,022
but we may face a real crisis soon.

170
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,817
What do you mean by that?

171
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,445
From now on,

172
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,991
the general opinion
of the scholars will fluctuate.

173
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,082
The Queen Dowager will become quite busy.

174
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,713
Well done, Lord Yoon.

175
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,596
I am expecting more guests,
so prepare tea.

176
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,814
-What is wrong?
-My stomach…

177
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,898
-Are you okay?
-It hurts!

178
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,359
Send for help! Hurry!

179
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,236
Are you all right?

180
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,450
Your Grace.

181
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,370
One of the scholars
urgently requests an audience.

182
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,666
What do you mean?

183
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,711
Prince Uiseong was in the lead
this morning.

184
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,297
What caused him to fall behind?

185
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,965
It is due to the records
in the Office of Royal Genealogy.

186
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,967
-What? The Office of Royal Genealogy?
-Yes.

187
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,428
Multiple records were found

188
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,972
of Prince Uiseong
assaulting the servants of the court.

189
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,435
I thought you had taken care of it.

190
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,521
They even found out
that you tried to cover it up.

191
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,233
I bet it was the Queen Dowager's doing.

192
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,570
There is not much time left.
What do we do?

193
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,992
The only person who can solve this

194
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,288
is the Queen Dowager.

195
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,711
We have finally realized

196
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,631
that without your help,

197
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,300
we can never

198
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:31,013
make Prince Uiseong the Crown Prince.

199
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,724
The outcome of this contest

200
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,810
depends on you, Your Royal Highness.

201
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,771
Please

202
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,732
support Prince Uiseong.

203
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,821
Being a Fourth Junior Consort
must have put fear into your heart.

204
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,033
Are you afraid you may never return

205
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,661
to your position?

206
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,247
My rank does not concern me.

207
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,916
I only dread

208
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,294
that Prince Uiseong will fail

209
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,964
to become the Crown Prince.

210
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,842
So please change your mind

211
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,012
and support him.

212
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,308
I would rather not.

213
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,897
However,

214
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,526
to defeat Grand Prince Seongnam,

215
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,946
either Prince Uiseong or Prince Bogeom

216
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,824
should remain in the contest.

217
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,953
In that case,

218
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,665
which one should I choose?

219
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,962
Seeing that she also asked you to come,
it must be good news.

220
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,007
Your Grace.

221
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,134
Her Royal Highness is waiting for you.

222
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,593
Please go on in.

223
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,604
Oh, my.

224
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,065
Have a seat, Prince Bogeom.

225
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,702
Your Royal Highness.

226
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,872
This is the first time
you have summoned both of us.

227
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,249
I am absolutely delighted.

228
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,170
Very well.

229
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,090
Consort Tae.

230
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,010
I have a favor to ask of you.

231
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,888
Anything you say, Your Royal Highness.

232
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,183
Retrieve the identification plaque
of Prince Bogeom, if you please.

233
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,149
What…

234
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,485
What do you mean, Your Royal Highness?

235
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,237
Drop out of the contest.

236
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,534
Why are you doing this so suddenly?

237
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,329
What do you mean, "suddenly"?

238
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,040
Have you forgotten
the promise you made to me?

239
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,417
What promise do you mean?

240
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,253
I do not understand
what you are talking about.

241
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,716
Do you really not remember it?

242
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,639
Are you bestowing this book unto me?

243
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,602
What can you give me in return,
Consort Tae?

244
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,396
I will obey

245
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,775
whatever orders you give me.

246
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,193
What if…

247
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,737
it is your life that I want?

248
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,123
No…

249
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,085
This is not right.

250
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,838
I can never accept it.

251
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,049
You promised me
you would support Prince Bogeom.

252
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,553
So why are you telling him
to drop out now?

253
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,263
Shut your mouth!

254
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,020
I promised to support him, so I did.

255
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,774
But now I have to bring him down.
That is all.

256
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,361
Do you think
the two of you would remain alive

257
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,573
if Grand Prince Seongnam
became the Crown Prince?

258
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,118
If you drop out now,

259
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,371
I will at least save your lives.

260
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,915
No.

261
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,585
Death does not scare me.

262
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,881
Why should Prince Bogeom give up
because of the promise I made?

263
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,175
This is not right.

264
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,969
The two of us will never back down.

265
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,306
You will have to kill me

266
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,225
before you make Prince Bogeom drop out.

267
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,939
It is because of your lack of judgment

268
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,109
that Prince Bogeom
will never become the Crown Prince.

269
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,867
Prince Bogeom,

270
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,622
I believe you are bright enough
to understand what I mean.

271
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,167
Grandmother.

272
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,670
I have a question.

273
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,632
Between Prince Uiseong and me,

274
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,635
why do you think
he should remain in the contest?

275
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,890
Is it really because of the promise
my mother made?

276
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,855
In horse racing,

277
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,151
one of the horses takes the lead

278
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,655
to speed up the other horses.

279
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,907
That is you.

280
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,039
I have never considered you
to be Crown Prince material.

281
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,292
You were born of a low-born mother.

282
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,797
Did you really think
you could become the Crown Prince?

283
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,682
Your Royal Highness.

284
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,433
I am willing to do anything you say.

285
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,852
Please change your mind.

286
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,522
I cannot be the reason
Prince Bogeom drops out.

287
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:19,236
Please reconsider, Your Royal Highness.

288
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,696
Please…

289
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,035
PRINCE BOGEOM

290
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,818
However,

291
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,571
to defeat Grand Prince Seongnam,

292
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,157
either Prince Uiseong or Prince Bogeom

293
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,784
should remain in the contest.

294
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,495
In that case,

295
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,999
which one should I choose?

296
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,302
Please choose Prince Uiseong.

297
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,682
What do I get in return?

298
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,105
I will give you
my control over personnel matters.

299
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,901
Are you content with only having control
over the Minister of War?

300
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,445
All six ministers

301
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,157
should be your people, should they not?

302
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,328
That sure sounds great,

303
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:55,957
but do you think I have gone
to such great lengths just for that?

304
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,628
Even if Prince Uiseong
becomes the Crown Prince,

305
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,214
I will not become queen.

306
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,052
Only the queen has control
over the ladies of the royal palace.

307
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,973
And I will give it to you.

308
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,477
What has never been yours

309
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,440
despite your high rank…

310
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,443
will finally be yours.

311
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,122
Send a message to the scholars

312
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,707
to support Prince Uiseong.

313
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,009
Your Majesty, the majority
have started supporting Prince Uiseong

314
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,637
since Prince Bogeom retrieved
his identification plaque.

315
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,350
I feel utterly frustrated.

316
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,727
This is absolutely unfair.

317
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,980
When the scholars could decide
on their own,

318
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,691
Grand Prince Seongnam was in the lead.

319
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,527
As if bribing and coaxing
the scholars were not enough,

320
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,988
they even made a candidate drop out!

321
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,156
Calm down.

322
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,616
I saw this coming all along.

323
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:13,910
However,

324
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,830
I cannot accept it

325
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,125
if I lose like this.

326
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,140
Halt!

327
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,189
They say impure food

328
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,691
is no better than poison.

329
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,948
I fear the scholars
will fall ill after eating this.

330
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,414
Your Majesty.

331
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,917
What are you doing here?

332
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,963
Is there any reason I should not be here?

333
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,759
His Majesty forbade anyone
to enter the chamber,

334
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,220
so I ask you to leave.

335
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,931
I refuse.

336
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,142
Because you are

337
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,438
not carrying out your duties properly
as the supervisor.

338
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,900
On what grounds do you say that?

339
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,860
What is going on?

340
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,784
With all due respect,

341
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,704
Her Majesty was examining

342
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,832
the food for the scholars
against your order.

343
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:29,212
It was to verify a report of misconduct
made by the inspector court lady.

344
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,464
"Misconduct," Your Majesty?

345
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,259
Do you have evidence?

346
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,303
Your Majesty.

347
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,888
I will find evidence,

348
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,560
so please allow me to go in.

349
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,487
I allow you.

350
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,491
Bring in the food.

351
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,246
"I have secured your post as assistant
section chief of the Ministry of Justice,

352
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,540
be sure to vote for so-and-so"

353
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,421
"I have received a hundred majigi
of valuable land in Seochon."

354
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,007
"Vote for so-and-so,

355
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,010
and you will be appointed
to a post in the Ministry of Rites."

356
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,395
Until now,

357
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,192
I have turned a blind eye
to these messages,

358
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,697
for I did not want the court servants
who delivered them to be sacrificed.

359
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,324
Also,

360
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,662
I trusted all of you.

361
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,624
I trusted you had
the principle and backbone

362
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,169
not to be swayed by mere pieces of paper.

363
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,505
After all,

364
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,675
you are the future pillars
of this kingdom.

365
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:26,097
So why are you selling off
a chance to become masters?

366
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,392
If you already engage in misconduct,

367
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:34,481
what will you possibly be able to do
as officials in the future?

368
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,612
It is undesirable for the ignorant
to be blinded by their faith.

369
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,281
But what is even more undesirable

370
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:48,119
is that those who should have principles
act against conscience.

371
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,375
Whoever sent these messages

372
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,461
and whoever received them

373
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,380
will not be held responsible.

374
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,554
But this may be

375
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,224
your last chance…

376
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,395
to preserve your integrity.

377
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,687
My apologies, Your Majesty.

378
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,649
I did not find any evidence.

379
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,875
We refuse to have any contact
with anyone from the outside.

380
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:03,296
We also refuse any food
until the final decision is made.

381
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,892
Your Majesty.

382
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,519
The scholars summoned

383
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,689
Grand Prince Seongnam
and Prince Uiseong to the chamber.

384
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:29,364
A family with huge gambling debts
attempted to end their lives.

385
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,951
As a result, the wife died
while the husband and the child survived.

386
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,995
The investigation revealed
that the husband stabbed his family

387
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,247
as agreed by his wife

388
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,541
and attempted to kill himself afterward.

389
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,004
Discuss whether the husband, Kim,
should be punished

390
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,422
for murdering his wife.

391
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,014
He should receive severe punishment
for causing his wife to die.

392
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,060
However, since his wife agreed to it

393
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,688
and he has a surviving child,

394
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,024
his punishment should be reduced
so he can support his child.

395
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,864
I disagree.

396
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,826
He should be punished properly
for his murder.

397
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,204
There is something we have overlooked.

398
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,832
It is the life of the child.

399
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,710
The couple never asked
the opinion of their child.

400
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,255
For the child, what happened was murder.

401
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:31,092
We must reconsider the idea that parents
have control over their child's life.

402
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:37,765
Therefore, this case should be deemed
to be family murder.

403
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,602
Accordingly,
Kim should be severely punished

404
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,312
for attempting to murder his child.

405
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,399
Also, the government should separate
the child from his father

406
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,317
and provide the child with protection.

407
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,210
Your Majesty.

408
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,338
I heard the evaluation just ended.

409
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,965
Is that right?

410
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,216
Your Majesty.

411
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,135
Prince Bogeom has arrived.

412
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,471
Will you excuse us?

413
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,682
Send him in.

414
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,078
Why did you send for me, Your Majesty?

415
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,748
I intend…

416
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,335
to punish your mother.

417
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,439
Her Majesty the Queen
has urgently summoned you.

418
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,781
As of today,

419
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,202
you are demoted
to a court maid of my quarters.

420
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,749
You have not only
leaked information about me

421
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,335
to Minister Yoon behind my back

422
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,464
but also spread false rumors about me.

423
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,553
You deserve to receive capital punishment,

424
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,264
but I am merely demoting you

425
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,683
because you are
the mother of Prince Bogeom.

426
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

427
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,356
Start by cleaning my bedchamber.

428
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,583
Clean it again.

429
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,586
Yes, Your Majesty.

430
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,799
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

431
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,052
Leave it. It is her duty.

432
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,097
Whoever

433
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,850
is caught helping her…

434
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,522
will not be forgiven.

435
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,896
Why is my mattress not mended yet?

436
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,190
Pardon?

437
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,192
Be sure to mend all of them

438
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,278
before I return.

439
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,735
Do not wake her up.

440
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,250
You are finally awake.

441
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,961
You seemed to be fast asleep.

442
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,301
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

443
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,054
Does your physical fatigue

444
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,140
clear your mind?

445
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,866
You are not a Third Senior Consort

446
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,244
just because
you gave birth to a son of His Majesty.

447
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:40,586
Your rank came with your duty
to take good care of the prince.

448
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:47,635
Also, as a parent, you should not let
your child go down a dangerous path.

449
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,473
I wanted to make Prince Bogeom

450
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,935
the Crown Prince no matter what.

451
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,939
Do my son and I
not even get to dream of that?

452
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,818
Even if you intend to help your child,
if you choose the wrong means,

453
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,320
you may end up harming your child.

454
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,366
Your greed caused Prince Bogeom

455
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,827
to be used

456
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,454
and get hurt.

457
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,876
I did all that for his sake.

458
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,713
Motherhood is still

459
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,133
too daunting for me.

460
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,181
Your Majesty.

461
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,143
I apologize for betraying you

462
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,562
despite the kindness you showed me.

463
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,232
Please forgive me.

464
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,284
I also find motherhood
the most challenging.

465
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,786
They say

466
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,165
the duty of a parent
is not to lead the way

467
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,750
but to show their child
the path they have walked.

468
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,712
You should at least

469
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,841
keep your child off dangerous paths.

470
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,726
If your mind has become clear again,

471
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,606
think carefully about what you should do
from now on as a mother.

472
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,152
I do not think

473
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,822
Prince Bogeom would want to see me.

474
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,035
I certainly would not.

475
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,039
Neither would I
if that is how you are going to look.

476
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,541
So go and wash your face

477
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,294
and dress up as usual.

478
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,588
You look terrible.

479
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,925
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,846
I intend to punish your mother.

481
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:03,229
What did she do so wrong?

482
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,023
Is it because I tried
to become the Crown Prince?

483
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,526
Why would that be a problem?

484
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,945
As a son of His Majesty,

485
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,323
you had every right
to partake in the contest

486
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,326
to select the Crown Prince.

487
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,412
Then why must she be punished?

488
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,416
By any chance,

489
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,461
is it because she enlisted
the help of the Queen Dowager?

490
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,301
Prince Bogeom.

491
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,722
What did you gain

492
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,849
through this contest?

493
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,352
I realized

494
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,314
I would never be able to overcome
the limits of my origins.

495
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,610
My hope turned out to be in vain.

496
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:56,490
Do you believe your failure
was solely caused by your origins?

497
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,952
Was there any injustice involved?

498
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,663
Did you perhaps resort to improper means?

499
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:07,167
I would like you to reflect on that.

500
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,380
The world is full of people

501
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,841
seeking to take advantage of those
blinded by their goals.

502
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,682
Prince Bogeom.

503
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,186
Becoming the Crown Prince
is not the only way to prove yourself.

504
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,483
Even though the King
possesses ultimate power,

505
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,613
he cannot do everything by himself.

506
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,532
I would like you

507
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:43,829
to assist the Crown Prince by his side.

508
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,629
Yes,

509
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,922
Your Majesty.

510
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,306
I have a favor to ask of you.

511
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,267
Go ahead.

512
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,854
Please do not punish my mother.

513
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:14,777
All this originated from my greed.

514
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,947
My mother, however,
must be blaming herself

515
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,241
for all that happened.

516
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,203
Are you

517
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,456
worried about your mother?

518
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,628
Come closer.

519
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,764
What about you?

520
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,809
Are you all right?

521
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,357
I am.

522
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,735
I am perfectly fine.

523
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,372
When things are tough,

524
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,626
it is okay to say so.

525
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,505
It is all right
to show that you are in pain.

526
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,508
Only then will others know

527
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,678
that you are not all right.

528
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,946
That is the Consort Tae I know.

529
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,588
Prince Bogeom.

530
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,735
Prince Bogeom.

531
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,907
I am sorry.

532
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,697
Prince Bogeom may be mature for his age,

533
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,909
but his mother must be the only person

534
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,786
he can truly rely on.

535
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:16,875
By the way, do you not resent
Consort Tae at all?

536
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,003
To think that one of your maids

537
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,589
became the concubine of His Majesty…

538
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,760
I would be too upset to even look at her.

539
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,512
I did avoid her for a while.

540
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,473
-Really?
-Of course.

541
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,183
I am a woman, after all.

542
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,770
When I found out I was not the reason

543
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,816
that His Majesty was visiting my chamber,

544
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,195
I secretly shed quite a few tears.

545
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,324
I still do not understand.

546
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,327
I would have ripped her to pieces.

547
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,082
It is just that

548
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,586
you seem to be very generous toward her.

549
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,046
She makes me smile.

550
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,841
She is one of a kind.

551
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,804
The palace would be…

552
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,266
boring without her.

553
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,606
What did the Queen say to the scholars?

554
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,691
Just what did she say

555
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,402
that immediately changed their attitude?

556
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,237
It is not known.

557
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,031
It is the only thing she has done

558
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,951
after being cooped up in her quarters
throughout the evaluation.

559
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,496
All we were able to do
was send in a few messages,

560
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,292
but she not only barged into the chamber

561
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,170
but also spoke to the scholars in person.

562
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,797
As His Majesty granted permission,

563
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,258
we should not raise an issue.

564
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,720
Prince Uiseong

565
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,806
must become the Crown Prince
no matter what.

566
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,351
Your Royal Highness.

567
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:02,230
Was Prince Uiseong your choice all along?

568
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,732
Yes.

569
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,902
I have never changed my mind.

570
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,782
Then why have you been supporting
Prince Bogeom?

571
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,408
I did not support him.

572
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,826
I used him.

573
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,622
Thanks to that, I have gained a lot more.

574
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,461
Then what will happen
to Prince Bogeom and Consort Tae now?

575
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,713
Now that I have extracted
all I can from them,

576
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,925
they are no longer of any use.

577
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,511
Becoming the Crown Prince?

578
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,515
Did the two of them ever deserve it?

579
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,896
I reckon you will turn your back on me

580
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,982
when I, too, am no longer of any use.

581
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,069
You are different.

582
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,988
Whoever becomes the Crown Prince,

583
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,617
your daughter
will become the Crown Princess.

584
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,499
The way he looked at me

585
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,503
as the sun rose in the morning…

586
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,881
"It really is pretty."

587
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:13,510
He was not referring to the sun.

588
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,845
-I see.
-I see.

589
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,472
Even though I did not see it myself,

590
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:21,935
the expression on his face,
his breath, and the look in his eyes…

591
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,562
I could feel it all.

592
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:28,984
A woman can always tell
when a man has feelings for her.

593
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,070
Even if he does not say a word,
you can just feel it.

594
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,031
And that is what they call destiny.

595
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,241
Did that man

596
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,035
adore you that much?

597
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:40,912
Yes, Mother.

598
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,332
He must have such great taste in women.

599
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:48,003
That is not all, Mother.

600
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,255
The way he hid his feelings for me

601
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:55,010
and worked relentlessly
to fulfill his task was truly amazing.

602
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,556
Father!

603
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,767
Father!

604
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,685
-You are home early.
-You little…

605
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,229
Did I not tell you
to stay in your chamber?

606
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,981
That is enough, my lord.

607
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,192
We should be grateful
that she returned safely.

608
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,698
I become worried
when she is out of my sight,

609
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,993
but I become even more worried
when she is around.

610
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,995
My goodness.

611
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,476
Is that certain?

612
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,394
Yes, my lord.

613
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,405
Your Majesty.

614
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,826
Your Majesty.

615
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:05,247
The representative scholar is on his way
to the hall of governance with the result.

616
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,300
Before we start a discussion

617
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,220
to select the Crown Prince,

618
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:26,017
I will announce the evaluation
delivered by the scholars.

619
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,770
Your Majesty.

620
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,731
I have something to report urgently.

621
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:37,028
Rumor has it that Grand Prince Seongnam,

622
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:41,241
who grew up outside the palace,
is not of royal blood.

623
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,623
What are you talking about?

624
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,044
Do you intend to slander the Queen and me?

625
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,087
Your Majesty.

626
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,423
If the rumor proves true,

627
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,801
Grand Prince Seongnam
cannot be the Crown Prince.

628
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:05,223
With all due respect, selecting
the Crown Prince is of utmost importance.

629
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,017
So even if the rumor is false,

630
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,770
I believe it should be clarified
before we proceed.

631
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,813
So?

632
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,316
What is it that you want?

633
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:20,780
I request that we verify whether or not
Grand Prince Seongnam is of royal blood.

634
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,115
Your Majesty.

635
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:25,535
If this is not settled now,
it will continue to cause controversy.

636
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,204
I advise you to get to the bottom of it
once and for all.

637
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,671
Chief Eunuch,

638
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,966
bring the Queen and Grand Prince Seongnam

639
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,177
to the Royal Clinic immediately.

640
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,560
I cannot believe
the court officials responded so eagerly

641
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,188
to a mere rumor on the streets.

642
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,571
Very well. I give my consent.

643
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,574
Please proceed.

644
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:14,918
I will use a method named haphyeolbeop
from the medical book, Sinjumuwonrok.

645
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,087
Haphyeolbeop?

646
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,965
That will leave wounds on their bodies.

647
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:23,718
That is the most accurate method
we can utilize to conduct this test.

648
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,681
You may begin.

649
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,854
I ask you to halt the process,
Your Majesty.

650
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,861
A wooden bowl will make it difficult
to see the result.

651
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,906
I ask that white porcelain bowls be used.

652
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,245
Do as she says.

653
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,834
If Grand Prince Seongnam
is of royal blood,

654
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,086
their blood will blend together.

655
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,535
This is pit viper venom.

656
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,038
When added to blood,
it causes it to congeal.

657
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,505
No one will be able to tell
if it is added to water.

658
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:46,384
The blood of the two
will congeal without blending.

659
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,729
The blood did not blend.

660
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,737
That proves Grand Prince Seongnam
is not of royal blood, does it not?

661
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,740
Haphyeolbeop alone is not reliable.

662
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,200
Chief Royal Secretary.

663
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,620
This is a proven method
from a medical book.

664
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,706
Your Majesty.

665
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,376
Grand Prince Seongnam is not qualified
to become the Crown Prince

666
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,712
and should be eliminated.

667
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,760
I cannot accept the result.

668
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:34,182
Haphyeolbeop does not produce
accurate results

669
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,976
when the water is contaminated.

670
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,771
Therefore,

671
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,735
I request that the Chief State Councilor
and Fourth Junior Consort Hwang

672
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,989
be tested with the same method.

673
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,449
Also,

674
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,661
I request that the same water be used.

675
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,618
Chief State Councilor.

676
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,415
Is Consort Hwang

677
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,751
not your real daughter?

678
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,801
Therefore,
I would like to use another method

679
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,763
to prove Grand Prince Seongnam
is of royal blood.

680
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,519
Please summon Grand Prince Muan,
Princes Uiseong, Bogeom, and Simso,

681
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,188
as well as the Queen Dowager here.

682
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,273
As you wish, My Queen.

683
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,368
His Majesty

684
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,664
has a distinctive bump-like bone
behind his ear.

685
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:26,127
I reckon the Queen Dowager
is well aware of it.

686
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,925
I am.

687
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,303
Interestingly,

688
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,014
most of the children of His Majesty

689
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,518
inherited the same characteristic.

690
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,523
Therefore,

691
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:50,485
I suggest that the Queen Dowager examine
the ears of her grandchildren herself.

692
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,073
Royal Physician Cho.

693
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:59,285
Is there any sense in what she is saying?

694
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,703
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

695
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:07,126
The bone of the ear
is considered a unique hereditary trait

696
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,712
and can be used to determine paternity.

697
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,478
He has the said bump.

698
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:56,050
Does Grand Prince Seongnam have it?

699
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:00,638
Yes,

700
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,016
he does.

701
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,536
All of the princes

702
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,708
have the same bump as His Majesty.

703
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,939
A child indecently conceived
during the mourning period

704
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,650
for the previous king.

705
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:02,659
That is why Grand Prince Seongnam
was forced to grow up outside the palace.

706
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,496
However, I was already pregnant

707
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,625
when the previous king passed away.

708
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,257
The mere speculation of the Queen Dowager

709
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,677
and the elders in the royal family

710
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:24,722
labeled Grand Prince Seongnam
as indecent even before his birth.

711
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,228
However, foolishly,

712
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,398
I failed to stand up against them.

713
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,904
As you had just ascended the throne,

714
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:46,244
I was afraid that this matter
would weaken your authority.

715
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,918
My failure to refute the accusation then

716
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,756
led to the controversy today.

717
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,640
Grand Prince Seongnam…

718
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,977
is my son.

719
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:16,232
The only reason
I condoned this absurd test

720
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:20,987
is to put an end to the controversy
caused by a false rumor.

721
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,456
Any doubt raised regarding the origins
of Grand Prince Seongnam

722
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,917
from this moment on

723
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,045
will be deemed to be slandering the King

724
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,215
and led to capital punishment.

725
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,687
I have hidden the truth

726
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,066
even from you all these years,

727
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,444
and it is all my fault.

728
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,281
I could not

729
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:09,243
bring myself to tell you
because I was ashamed of my foolishness.

730
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:16,083
Just because I am a mother and an adult

731
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,170
does not mean I am right all the time.

732
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,466
I am sorry.

733
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,847
You do not have to be.

734
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:34,852
I am aware that you used to come
and see me when I was a child.

735
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,688
You also…

736
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,149
sent Brother to me.

737
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,821
He taught me how to read

738
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,405
and trained me as well.

739
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:49,867
Look at me now.

740
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:54,497
Did I not turn out much better
than the naive princes who grew up

741
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,458
sheltered in the palace?

742
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:16,561
I will announce the winner of the contest
and the next Crown Prince.

743
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,857
It is Grand Prince Seongnam.

744
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,278
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

745
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,787
We lost the crown before our very eyes.

746
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:39,125
To Grand Prince Seongnam, of all people!

747
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,044
Do not be upset.

748
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,922
I may still have a chance.

749
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:50,011
Not all crown princes become the king.

750
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,180
I ask both of you

751
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,309
to bring him down from his position
with whatever means you can.

752
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,104
Very well. We will.

753
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,358
We have done it once.
We can certainly do it again.

754
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:09,363
By the way, what happened to Seo Ham-deok?

755
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,575
He knows that I killed an innocent person.

756
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,869
If he ever reveals it,

757
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,247
I might lose my chance forever.

758
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,751
I will take care of him.

759
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,425
My stomach!

760
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,391
Goodness, my stomach!

761
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,687
-What is the matter?
-My stomach…

762
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,606
-My stomach hurts.
-Send for a physician.

763
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,776
He is to be questioned shortly.
Please examine him before that.

764
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,650
Mother.

765
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,485
Promise me…

766
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,571
that you will remain strong.

767
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,283
Only then will I be able to die in peace.

768
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:48,337
I will stay by your side even as the wind.

769
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,676
Please do protect my son and brothers.

770
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,644
I think I have

771
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,356
kept the promise I made to you
to some extent.

772
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,362
You slept in this chamber alone

773
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,782
for the first time when you turned five.

774
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:21,120
You held my hand all night.

775
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,168
I believe…

776
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,883
it is time for me to let go of your hand.

777
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,603
Clean out the quarters of the Crown Prince

778
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,688
and replace the mattress.

779
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,190
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

780
01:07:56,655 --> 01:08:00,743
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM

781
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,984
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

782
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:10,312
I cannot help but smile
just by looking at your face.

783
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,605
What poison…

784
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,608
did you use on the Crown Prince back then?

785
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,193
A participation form?

786
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:19,280
We must find a strong candidate
and recommend her.

787
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:21,115
Father, I want to be the Crown Princess.

788
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,076
It has to be me no matter what.

789
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,329
I must gift him the worst bride.

790
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,708
There must be people who are in league
with the deposed Queen Yoon and her son.

791
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,877
The only one who can clarify
the death of the Crown Prince

792
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,670
is Physician Kwon.

793
