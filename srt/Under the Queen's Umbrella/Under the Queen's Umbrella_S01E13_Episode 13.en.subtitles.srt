1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,460
EPISODE 13

3
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,140
I will leave the collateral for him.

4
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,267
Thank you.

5
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,062
My lord!

6
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,816
I really missed you.

7
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,902
My name is Yoon Cheong-ha.

8
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,830
It is so pretty.

9
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,876
When you see another beautiful sunrise
just like this one,

10
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,420
you will surely think of me, right?

11
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,634
The eldest daughter of the Minister of War
stands on the side of the Queen Dowager.

12
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,433
Your Royal Highness!

13
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,334
Have you no fear?

14
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,588
This is the royal palace.

15
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,549
How dare you bring

16
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,135
a child of a Grand Prince
born out of wedlock?

17
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,264
Please take this child in.

18
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,730
How irresponsible of you.

19
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,610
How could you think of
abandoning an unweaned child?

20
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,492
It has been a few days

21
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,538
since the child started recognizing faces.

22
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,293
Once the child starts
to recognize their mother's face,

23
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,547
it will only get harder for the child.

24
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,807
Your Royal Highness, you must return
to the quarters of the Crown Princess.

25
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,354
Your Royal Highness.

26
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,523
The bride should not be left alone
on the night of the royal wedding.

27
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,194
She will shed tears all night long.

28
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,530
Your Royal Highness.

29
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,963
I got deserted on my wedding night?

30
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,759
What is the reason?

31
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,220
Does he not like me?

32
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,892
Or perhaps he feels uncomfortable
sleeping together?

33
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,438
Do not tell me…

34
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,817
Does he not know how to make love?

35
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,862
If so, this is a serious problem.

36
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,244
So what? We can learn that together.

37
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,526
Well,

38
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,236
Mother.

39
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,617
Can you just tell me
what it is that I did wrong?

40
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,375
Come in.

41
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,843
Why is there a baby?

42
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,432
How adorable.

43
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,934
Peekaboo!

44
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,688
Who is this beautiful baby?

45
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,113
By any chance,

46
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,158
is it my child?

47
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,833
Then what about Cho-wol?

48
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,252
Where is Cho-wol?

49
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,507
She left after leaving the child with us.

50
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,014
Mother.

51
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,682
Please look for Cho-wol.

52
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,394
Do you

53
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,064
not understand your current situation?

54
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,150
Do you have any idea

55
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,279
what will happen
if the identity of the child is exposed?

56
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,657
Then,

57
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,159
I can raise the child
without getting caught.

58
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,415
Do you know how dangerous that is?

59
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,043
If anyone finds out…

60
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,759
That child will have to

61
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,720
live with the label
of being born out of wedlock.

62
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,142
But we cannot just abandon the baby.

63
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,437
I will

64
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,231
take responsibility and raise the child.

65
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,109
Are you sure

66
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,194
you can keep your word?

67
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:28,823
Yes, Mother.

68
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,743
Very well.

69
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,787
Go ahead and do as you said.

70
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,259
Are you leaving already?

71
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,511
Mother?

72
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,346
Mother!

73
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,027
Let us go to sleep.

74
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,743
Baby.

75
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,370
Can you please be quiet?

76
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,172
If anyone hears you, we will get caught.

77
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,354
Stop crying and go to sleep now, will you?

78
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,699
Why are you crying?

79
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,078
I need to know why so that I can help you.

80
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,987
There are such shells everywhere,

81
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,658
but I will keep that one's other half.

82
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,454
So if we meet once again,

83
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,456
please consider it fate.

84
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,046
The eldest daughter of the Minister of War
stands on the side of the Queen Dowager.

85
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,279
Your Royal Highness.

86
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,074
It is time for you to pay your respects.

87
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,123
Where is His Royal Highness?

88
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,254
He left last night and never returned.

89
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,172
Pardon?

90
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,174
Why?

91
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,426
I do not know.

92
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,678
I thought about it all night.

93
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,931
But I still do not know why.

94
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,810
I will just ask him

95
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,770
when we pay our respects.

96
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,740
Your Royal Highness.

97
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,993
Why did you leave last night?

98
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,664
Announce our arrival.

99
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,359
I am here to pay my respects, Grandmother.

100
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,279
Did you have a good night?

101
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,656
Yes, I did.

102
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:26,287
Did the two of you
successfully consummate your marriage?

103
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,587
Since early this morning, there was
a strange rumor spreading in the palace,

104
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,424
so I was worried.

105
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,718
I heard

106
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,848
you left the quarters
of the Crown Princess last night.

107
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,600
Is it true?

108
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:54,190
Your servants must be
very interested in me.

109
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,442
They seem too busy to serve you

110
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,195
because their eyes are fixed
on my quarters.

111
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,237
Your Royal Highness.

112
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,950
It is true that His Royal Highness
left my quarters for a moment,

113
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,745
but he returned shortly after.

114
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,915
Is that so?

115
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,752
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
So you do not have to worry.

116
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,145
The Crown Prince and Princess
did not spend the night together?

117
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,772
No, Your Majesty.

118
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,192
Everyone in the palace
is busy talking about

119
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,444
how the Crown Princess was neglected.

120
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,573
Send word to the Crown Prince.

121
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,535
Tell him to visit me
once his evening lessons end.

122
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

123
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,454
What about Grand Prince Muan?

124
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,207
How is he doing?

125
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,002
Fortunately, it seems
he survived the night.

126
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,004
To be honest,

127
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,174
I thought His Highness would not
even make it through one night.

128
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,929
Your Majesty,
the Crown Princess has come to visit you.

129
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,447
Baby.

130
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,743
Stop crying and go to sleep now, will you?

131
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,626
It has only been one day.

132
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,256
But it feels like a year.

133
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,795
His Royal Highness

134
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,299
left me alone in my quarters last night.

135
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,053
What could be the reason?

136
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,308
I came to visit you
in hopes that you would know something.

137
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,479
You must have been very upset.

138
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,315
Yes, Your Majesty.

139
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,611
By the way, Your Majesty,

140
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:50,908
did the Crown Prince not receive
any education about intercourse?

141
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,785
No.

142
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,912
He was never taught that.

143
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,705
Why not?

144
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,249
I may be his parent,

145
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,545
but how can I explain
what happens in bed in such detail?

146
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,219
However, Your Majesty,

147
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,222
I was taught
that there is nothing more important

148
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,224
to the Crown Prince than having an heir.

149
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,269
It is also our duty
to accede to the throne.

150
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,522
If you were an ordinary parent,

151
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,191
teaching your child how to make love
would be unnecessary.

152
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,568
But you are the Queen,

153
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,445
so you have the responsibility

154
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,864
to teach the Crown Prince
how to fulfill his duties.

155
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,412
Come to think of it,
I am partially responsible.

156
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,456
I will set another date.

157
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,418
Why do we have to set a date?

158
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,839
That is…

159
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,383
a very interesting question.

160
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,192
What is the matter?

161
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,986
Court Lady Shin.

162
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,821
Please save me.

163
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,115
The baby did not sleep a wink.

164
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,534
What is the reason?

165
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,957
I have never raised a child before either,
so I do not know.

166
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,795
Do not tell me you left the baby alone.

167
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,213
I did not.

168
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,803
Goodness, Your Highness.

169
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,724
If you roam around like this,
someone will notice her.

170
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,820
Peekaboo!

171
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,447
Peekaboo!

172
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,076
Peekaboo!

173
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,745
Peekaboo!

174
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,207
What are you doing?

175
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,085
Your Majesty.

176
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,796
You said you would raise her on your own.

177
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,672
What are you doing here?

178
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,394
Please save me, Mother.

179
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,315
She constantly cries
and will not fall asleep.

180
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,567
Please help me.

181
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,403
Were you not so confident?

182
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,535
-Mother.
-What is it?

183
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:44,081
Ever since yesterday, I have not been able
to eat, sleep, or relieve myself.

184
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,258
And the hardest to control

185
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,552
is bowel movements.

186
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,267
Oh, dear, Your Majesty.

187
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,153
Uichang, the Righteous Granaries,
was formed to provide aid for the needy.

188
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,113
However, it has become corrupt,

189
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:20,492
and the people have not been able
to receive the benefits for a long time.

190
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,245
Therefore,

191
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,457
I am thinking of putting the Crown Prince
in charge of reforming Uichang.

192
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,211
Your Majesty.

193
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:36,008
It has not been long
since His Royal Highness has been crowned.

194
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,136
I believe it is too early to entrust him
with such an important task

195
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,471
related to political affairs.

196
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,310
I respectfully disagree,
Chief State Councilor.

197
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,313
I believe it is a great opportunity

198
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,857
for the Crown Prince
to display his abilities.

199
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,988
The Crown Prince made realistic proposals
to improve Uichang during the contest.

200
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,909
I believe entrusting him with the task
is not a far-fetched idea.

201
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,287
However, Your Majesty, His Royal Highness

202
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,666
is not yet experienced enough
to handle political affairs.

203
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,961
He may be inexperienced, but that may,

204
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,007
in turn, lead him to approach the problem
with a new perspective.

205
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,261
The reason why we have not yet
been able to solve this problem

206
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:26,016
is that we court officials
were not able to think unconventionally.

207
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,939
What do you think, Minister of Taxation?

208
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,068
If the experience
I built outside the palace

209
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,947
and the innovative perspective
of the Crown Prince mix well,

210
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:45,244
I am certain we will contribute
to solving the chronic issue of Uichang.

211
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,250
Very well, then.

212
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,336
Your Majesty.

213
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,883
If the Crown Prince
fails to execute this task successfully,

214
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:05,472
he should no longer be allowed
to take part in political affairs.

215
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,253
Your Royal Highness,
is there a book you are looking for?

216
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,798
I wanted to see
if there were any books about Uichang.

217
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,800
But I do not see any.

218
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,013
Find the books regarding Sangpyeongchang
and the jinhyulchaek.

219
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,681
SANGPYEONGCHANG:
ORGANIZATION OF PRICE REGULATION

220
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,224
JINHYULCHAEK: RELIEF POLICY
FOR THOSE IN NEED

221
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,480
What is the matter, Your Royal Highness?

222
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,901
These well-thumbed books

223
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,989
are the only things left
that belonged to my brother.

224
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,627
She will wake up
as soon as you lay her down.

225
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,669
I am serious.

226
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,564
Mother.

227
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,982
What is your secret?

228
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,901
Do you know

229
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,029
why rituals for rain have not once failed?

230
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,326
It is because people wait until it rains.

231
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,247
The same applies to babies.

232
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,626
You have to hold them close
and soothe them until they stop crying.

233
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,465
She is the cutest when she is asleep.

234
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,300
You were too.

235
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,511
Seeing how she is a light sleeper

236
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,763
and she wakes up
as soon as you lay her down,

237
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,351
I guess she is your child.

238
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,979
Was I also like her?

239
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,313
You were much worse.

240
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,567
You only fell asleep
after I held you for long hours.

241
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,411
She has to grow up without a mother.

242
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,957
I feel so bad for her.

243
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,654
My apologies, Mother.

244
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,656
I had a lecture to attend, so I am late.

245
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,954
It must be hard to adapt to all
the sudden changes, Your Royal Highness.

246
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,665
Mother.

247
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,293
When we are alone,
please drop the honorifics.

248
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,545
That is the hardest to adapt to.

249
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,343
Very well.

250
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,846
What did you want to speak with me about?

251
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,266
By any chance,

252
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,770
do you not like the Crown Princess?

253
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,815
That is not true.

254
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,942
Then,

255
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,404
why did you leave her quarters
without spending the night with her?

256
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,118
Crown Prince.

257
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,914
I selected the Crown Princess.

258
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,583
You did?

259
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:50,173
Before the selection, I happened
to meet the Crown Princess by chance.

260
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,968
She seemed bright and confident,
which I admired.

261
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:54,886
However,

262
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,099
there is another reason
why I thought highly of her.

263
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,771
I chose her
because she was in love with you.

264
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,482
I mean, she loves my son.

265
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,651
How could I not adore her?

266
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,742
You are the only reason why
she entered the palace.

267
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,952
Therefore,

268
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,664
you need to protect and cherish her.

269
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,834
Yes, Mother.

270
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,549
What is it?

271
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,926
Do you have something more to say?

272
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,388
There is something I must show you.

273
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,941
What is this?

274
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,194
I believe it is a portion
of Brother's treatment journal.

275
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,256
It seems like Physician Kwon
did not only treat hyeolheogwol.

276
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,700
Your Highness.

277
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,120
Why did you call me to a place like this?

278
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,874
Since you are here,

279
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,876
please have a seat.

280
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,072
Ever since Physician Kwon started
performing acupuncture on gimunhyeol,

281
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,573
I started coughing up blood.

282
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:25,453
The pain around my ribs
is also getting worse.

283
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,748
This journal was indeed
written by your brother.

284
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,462
There were a lot of records
regarding acupuncture on gimunhyeol,

285
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,508
but I did not suspect anything
since it was to treat hyeolheogwol.

286
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,594
According to another physician,

287
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,305
it is a point for treating hyeolheogwol,

288
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,600
but depending on the depth of the needle,
it can also damage the organ.

289
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,440
What we now know for certain

290
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,151
is that his symptoms
of coughing up blood appeared

291
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,153
after Physician Kwon
started performing acupuncture.

292
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:04,075
If your brother was murdered,

293
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,664
the prime suspect is Physician Kwon.

294
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,667
However,

295
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,837
Physician Kwon had no motive for murder.

296
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,173
Someone else must be behind it.

297
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,260
There were many people within the palace

298
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,095
who wanted to kill your brother.

299
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,893
If it was really Physician Kwon's doing,

300
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,812
is there a way to prove it?

301
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,494
I will pretend
I did not just hear that nonsense.

302
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,416
Then you will no longer have a chance.

303
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,461
How bold of you.

304
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,964
What will you do if I expose you?

305
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,217
Do you not agree?

306
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,303
You killed an innocent civilian
so you could become the Crown Prince.

307
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,848
But in the end,
a direct heir inherited the crown.

308
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,684
Do you think you will get another chance?

309
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,021
Even if we were to drag down
the Crown Prince right now,

310
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:19,859
if His Majesty were to ever hear
that you killed an innocent civilian,

311
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,319
I am pretty sure

312
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,824
he will never let you
become the Crown Prince.

313
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,910
So are you telling me
to rebel against my father?

314
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,454
If he cannot ascend you to the throne,

315
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,748
you can always step over him to do so.

316
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,958
Shut your mouth!

317
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,002
He is my father.

318
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,630
And I will not take part
in your treachery.

319
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,008
The current king
took the throne through treason!

320
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,304
We are only trying to restore a dynasty
that was usurped.

321
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,640
We are also giving you a chance.

322
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,025
We will make you the Crown Prince.

323
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,405
You are a mere physician.

324
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,325
What power do you hold
to make me the Crown Prince?

325
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,119
I am the one who killed
the late Crown Prince

326
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,871
on the order of your mother.

327
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,545
It was only possible
because I was a mere physician.

328
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,178
So?

329
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,806
What do you want from me?

330
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,894
Provide us with the opportunity
to meet the Chief State Councilor.

331
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,411
I shall withdraw the dismissal
of Kwon O-gyeong

332
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,414
and reinstate him
as a physician of the Royal Clinic.

333
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,441
It was not me.

334
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,445
You are not the one who called
Physician Kwon back into the palace?

335
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,446
No.

336
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,157
I was planning on reinstating him,

337
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,368
but not this soon.

338
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,372
Then who on earth called him back?

339
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,628
I am much obliged, Your Majesty.

340
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:50,593
I heard you made a request
to His Majesty to reinstate me.

341
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,306
You went through a lot.

342
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,600
Not at all.

343
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:02,313
Your Majesty, is there a reason
why you called me back?

344
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,775
It seems…

345
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,862
the late Crown Prince was poisoned.

346
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:19,706
Why is it that you think
the Crown Prince was poisoned?

347
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,417
If that happens to be true,

348
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,379
the first person
who should be suspected is me.

349
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,759
I was always with you
when you treated the Crown Prince.

350
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,680
If you harmed the Crown Prince,

351
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,558
I would not be free from blame either.

352
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,480
Physician Kwon.

353
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,236
Would you like to join me in finding out

354
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,281
how and why

355
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,784
the Crown Prince had to die?

356
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,538
Yes, Your Majesty.

357
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,749
I am at your service, Your Majesty.

358
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,417
I shall do

359
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,045
whatever it takes to reveal the truth.

360
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,803
If it was really Physician Kwon's doing,
is there a way to prove it?

361
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,270
I am going to call Physician Kwon
back into the palace.

362
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,023
I will use him

363
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,152
and make him bring me the poison
that killed your brother.

364
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,421
The reinstatement

365
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,632
could be a trap.

366
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,635
The Queen has found out
that the late Crown Prince was poisoned.

367
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,387
There is no way of escaping now.

368
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,641
This may be better for us.

369
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,269
We can use this opportunity
to our advantage.

370
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,826
Her Majesty said she would set a date
for our night together.

371
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,703
How am I supposed to wait until then?

372
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,122
Goodness. Is it that hard to wait?

373
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,875
Do not get me wrong.

374
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,335
It is not because I want to
spend the night with him.

375
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,797
It is because that is the only time
I get to be with His Royal Highness.

376
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,049
If there is no other time,

377
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,468
you can just make an opportunity.

378
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,846
It is said that His Royal Highness

379
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,223
consumes two spoonfuls
of grain syrup every morning.

380
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,518
Is that so?

381
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,614
Why is no one here?

382
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,366
Should we just return to your quarters?

383
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,078
But we came all the way here.

384
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,290
Open the door.

385
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,981
What are you doing there?

386
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,486
I heard you consume grain syrup
in the morning, so…

387
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,032
But why are you standing there like that?

388
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,369
I was putting on my garments.

389
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,876
Crown Princess.

390
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,212
Could you leave now?

391
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,715
I will leave after putting this down.

392
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,909
Crown Princess.

393
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,121
Could you remove your hand?

394
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,708
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

395
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,491
Brother.

396
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,784
-We are here.
-We are here.

397
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,125
What?

398
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,795
There is nothing you can hide
in the palace.

399
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,964
Right?

400
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,013
So?

401
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,556
Did you meet the nurse?

402
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,475
Yes. As you expected,

403
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,728
she was the nurse who helped treat
Crown Prince Taein's hyeolheogwol.

404
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,023
What did she say
the prince looked like after his death?

405
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,692
Did she remember his scar?

406
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,570
She left the Royal Clinic
in the middle of the treatment

407
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,197
and did not see his corpse.

408
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,169
I am not sure if this will be of any help.

409
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,670
What is this?

410
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,966
It is the prescription written
by Royal Physician Yoo at the time.

411
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,010
Her mother also suffered
from hyeolheogwol,

412
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,179
so she took it with her
when she left the Royal Clinic.

413
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,558
Bring me the prescription that was brought
from outside the palace.

414
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,205
BAEKBOKRYEONG

415
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:25,548
OMAE

416
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,342
Call the Crown Prince at once!

417
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,052
Yes, Your Majesty.

418
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:37,017
Typically, prescriptions for hyeolheogwol
do not include baekbokryeong and omae.

419
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,854
However, Yoo Sang-uk's prescription

420
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,064
and the one you brought from the outside

421
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,608
both include those two herbs.

422
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,362
Even the handwriting is similar.

423
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,951
Master Toji,
the person who prescribed this…

424
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,202
What is he like?

425
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,372
I heard he is a skillful physician
who wanders around.

426
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,748
Can we find him?

427
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,293
He used to live in the hut village,

428
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,086
but no one knows his whereabouts now.

429
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,924
We have to…

430
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,386
find him no matter what.

431
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,199
The poison used on the late Crown Prince

432
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,451
is a yungaek that does not
react to beopmul.

433
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,995
YUNGAEK: LIQUID, BEOPMUL: TOOL USED
TO DETECT POISON DURING AUTOPSY

434
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,717
Who did you say you found?

435
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,136
I found Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk.

436
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,266
But I heard he passed long ago.

437
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,893
No, he is alive.

438
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,897
He was seen in Hanseong,

439
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,565
so we will find him soon.

440
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,361
I am quite certain

441
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,114
he will be the key to revealing the cause

442
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,909
of the death of the late Crown Prince.

443
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,669
Who in their right mind
would think of doing that?

444
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,547
His Majesty is your father.

445
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,759
He is a father who has
never embraced me warmly.

446
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,969
You cannot do this.

447
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,390
The one they are trying to make king
is Grand Prince Yeongwon, Yi Ik-hyeon.

448
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,433
He is the younger brother
of Crown Prince Taein!

449
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:46,230
It is I who killed all of his brothers
and helped His Majesty ascend the throne.

450
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:50,568
How could you ask me to do such a thing?

451
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,612
Yi Ik-hyeon will end up dying.

452
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,365
What do you mean?

453
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,868
The biggest mistake you made
during the revolt 20 years ago

454
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,496
is that you let the deposed Queen
and Yi Ik-hyeon live.

455
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,455
However,

456
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,458
I will not make such a mistake.

457
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,877
What on earth are you thinking?

458
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,838
If I cannot become the Crown Prince,

459
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,049
I will aim for the throne.

460
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,645
Her eyes, nose, and lips
fit in her small face.

461
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,900
I cannot believe
such a beautiful baby is your child.

462
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,944
She takes after me.

463
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,821
Come on.

464
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,364
I do not see the resemblance.

465
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,408
Not in her eyes, nose, or lips.

466
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,243
What are you saying?

467
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,828
She looks exactly like me.

468
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,080
No, she does not.

469
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,376
What part of her takes after you?

470
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,170
There.

471
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,631
-I found something.
-What is it?

472
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,300
Her toes resemble yours.

473
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,303
Goodness.

474
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,642
It is my first time seeing you read a book
of your own accord.

475
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,353
What is the book about
for you to be so immersed in it?

476
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:11,857
It is Yangarok.

477
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,110
It was written by a grandfather
to record the growth of his grandson.

478
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,407
It brings about emotions that can only
be felt by those who have children.

479
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,953
I am also thinking of writing a book
for A-ra starting today.

480
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,498
Have you already named the baby?

481
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,291
That is right. I named her A-ra.

482
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,630
A-ra, do you like your name?

483
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,259
She is so adorable.

484
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,637
I always wanted to have a younger sister.

485
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,889
I am so glad.

486
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,558
Your Highness.

487
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,061
It is time to feed the baby.

488
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,448
Court Lady Shin.

489
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,701
The bond between us siblings
is just so strong.

490
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,247
Please keep it a secret from Mother.

491
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,751
I will bring her back
once she is done being fed.

492
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:14,920
Thank you.

493
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,590
All right.

494
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,342
Come on then.

495
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,949
Her Grace fell asleep just now
after being fed.

496
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,035
Very well.

497
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,788
Keep her next to her wet nurse

498
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,167
until she wakes up.

499
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,085
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,428
You sleep so well

501
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,430
after being well-fed.

502
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,723
Mother!

503
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,936
Mother.

504
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,146
I think A-ra is unwell.

505
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,900
She seems to have a mild fever
and wakes up after every half an hour.

506
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,193
Bring her to me.

507
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,366
What is wrong?

508
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,618
What is causing her to be sick?

509
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,913
She does not seem to have a fever.

510
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,040
Did she vomit or have diarrhea?

511
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,086
No, she did not.

512
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,089
It seems to be yaje, infantile colic.

513
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,257
For now,

514
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,260
we have to keep her warm.

515
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,226
It is not your fault.

516
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,436
This is common for infants.

517
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,857
I am an incompetent father.

518
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,361
I can never resolve a problem on my own.

519
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,699
I always need your help, Mother.

520
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,456
Mother.

521
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,792
I have a request to make.

522
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,711
Go ahead.

523
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,879
Can you please find Cho-wol?

524
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,174
No matter how great I do,

525
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,511
A-ra needs a mother.

526
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,807
Also, Cho-wol would want to
see A-ra as well.

527
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,398
Then,

528
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,818
no matter what happens in the future,

529
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,529
are you ready to face the consequences

530
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,324
without running away?

531
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,541
Yes, I can handle it.

532
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:46,923
Bring in her wet nurse.

533
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:03,398
You must serve Princess A-ra
with all your heart.

534
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,609
Yes, Your Majesty.

535
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,864
Cho-wol.

536
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,370
If I raise this child,

537
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,956
she will be destined to live a low life.

538
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,959
So please…

539
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,255
Please take in this child.

540
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,300
That would mean

541
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,095
you will no longer be able to live
as the mother of the child.

542
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,847
You may not even be able to see her again.

543
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,234
-I am aware.
-You may regret your decision.

544
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,822
It will be more painful
than you can imagine.

545
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,244
I have also…

546
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,539
once abandoned a newborn baby.

547
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,792
I regretted it instantly.

548
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:09,214
But it took a long time to return
everything to its rightful place.

549
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,508
Right now,

550
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,012
you may think
this is the best option for the child,

551
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,182
but it might not be.

552
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,408
I will try to come up with a solution.

553
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,203
Will you do as I say?

554
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,217
Mother.

555
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,513
Make sure you do not get caught.

556
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,351
When the time is right,

557
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,854
I will let you live
without having to hide.

558
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,882
I was worried
that a child was raising a child.

559
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,010
But it seems he has grown
in the past few days.

560
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:41,181
As for the wet nurse,
look after her in my stead.

561
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,849
Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,063
Come on now.

563
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,648
Why are you doing this again?

564
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,608
Why did you suddenly disappear
without a trace?

565
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,860
What do you mean?

566
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,112
I am a mere physician.

567
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,907
If my patients call for me,
I have to wander and find them.

568
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,867
How is that a problem?

569
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,208
You are not a mere physician,

570
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,126
Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk.

571
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,886
Let me ask again.

572
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,723
You must have heard
about the death of the late Crown Prince.

573
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,518
Why did you vanish
immediately after his death?

574
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,526
Answer me.

575
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,658
Upon hearing that another crown prince
passed after receiving my treatment,

576
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,327
I was afraid

577
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:48,039
and distressed that I had to hide.

578
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,833
However,

579
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,837
there was nothing wrong
with my prescription.

580
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,923
You are well aware of that, are you not?

581
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,734
Take a look at this.

582
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,584
Who does this belong to?

583
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,711
What is the matter?

584
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,215
Is this the bokgeomsihyeongdo
of Crown Prince Taein?

585
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,676
BOKGEOMSIHYEONGDO:
A DRAWING OF THE STATE OF A DEAD BODY

586
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,428
That is my brother's.

587
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,224
That cannot be true.

588
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:52,520
This is too similar to the report
of Crown Prince Taein, who was poisoned.

589
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,358
Did you just say "poisoned"?

590
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,197
Crown Prince Taein also had
a similar scar on his chest.

591
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,077
The poison that was used
has not yet been uncovered.

592
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,956
But I am certain that Crown Prince Taein
was poisoned to death.

593
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,003
Are you telling me that Crown Prince Taein

594
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,547
and my brother were killed
with the same method?

595
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,011
There is no evidence left.

596
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,221
So…

597
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,640
how am I supposed to trust you?

598
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,938
I am the one who examined
the corpse of Crown Prince Taein.

599
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:41,444
The late king was there with me,
and he observed the whole process.

600
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,117
Then I will become the bait.

601
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,456
The Queen found out that I am Yoo Sang-uk.

602
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,293
I will turn that to our advantage.

603
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,507
Are you saying
you will get caught on purpose?

604
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,676
Yes.

605
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,514
I am going to make Her Majesty dig into
the death of Crown Prince Taein herself.

606
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,768
She will end up heading in that direction.

607
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,232
That is a risky strategy.

608
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:24,070
Approaching those records ourselves
is even riskier, and you know that.

609
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,993
We will provide her with a shortcut.

610
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,538
Once the Queen starts to move,
we will hide in her shadow

611
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,416
and unlock the secrets.

612
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,175
Keep an eye on him.

613
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,676
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

614
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,645
You were right, Mother.

615
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,563
Yes.

616
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,273
Master Toji…

617
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,192
I mean,

618
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:07,030
Yoo Sang-uk and Physician Kwon
are connected in some way.

619
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,159
Seeing how he fell into the trap
on his own

620
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,661
tells me that he is willing

621
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,165
to take the risk
in order to obtain something from me.

622
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,293
We cannot trust
everything Yoo Sang-uk says,

623
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:23,505
but if the late king was really present
during the examination,

624
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:28,176
there should be a record of it
in Seungjeongwon ilgi.

625
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,638
The documentation official
records every detail of the king's life.

626
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,473
You are right.

627
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:38,478
Therefore, even though
the certificate of death has disappeared,

628
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,688
as long as we find that record,

629
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,526
we may be able to reveal the cause
of the death of your brother.

630
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,904
However, that record is in Seungjeongwon,
the Royal Secretariat.

631
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,365
Approaching Seungjeongwon in private

632
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,991
would be violating the law.

633
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:10,301
It has been so long since we talked
over a cup of tea like this.

634
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,524
It is pine needle tea
that helps you fall asleep

635
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,067
if drunk before bed.

636
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,906
I have never seen such a cup before.

637
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,535
It is from the Western Regions.

638
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:39,581
If you pour water into this cup that is
thinner and clearer than cherry blossoms,

639
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,250
you will be able to see

640
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,836
the tea leaves swirl around as it brews.

641
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,631
I do not have to smell it

642
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,510
to figure out what is inside this cup.

643
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,139
Even if there were weeds

644
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,225
instead of tea leaves,

645
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,437
I would easily be able to tell.

646
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,317
Have a drink.

647
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,152
Very well.

648
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:19,829
Goodness.

649
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,000
I can no longer drink the tea
you have prepared, Consort Hwang.

650
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,462
Let us end our chat here.

651
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,178
Seeing that you used poison on me,

652
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,724
it seems like I have found out something
I should not have.

653
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,938
Who is the real father

654
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,565
of Prince Uiseong?

655
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,319
Mother.

656
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,333
Have you been well?

657
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,291
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

658
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,367
I will not allow the reinvestigation

659
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,910
of the death of Crown Prince Taein.

660
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:08,456
There is a person and incident involved
that you cannot handle.

661
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,792
It seems like the Queen
is suspicious of me.

662
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,920
Father might become their next target.

663
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,254
It is too late.

664
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,465
The Queen Dowager
also seems to be aware of this.

665
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,677
Your marriage will be consummated
tonight at midnight

666
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,136
when the moon is full.

667
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,721
What? Hwaja?

668
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,432
There is a rumor in the palace
that he is infertile.

669
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,642
This is it.

670
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,227
The poison that killed
the late Crown Prince.

671
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:36,067
