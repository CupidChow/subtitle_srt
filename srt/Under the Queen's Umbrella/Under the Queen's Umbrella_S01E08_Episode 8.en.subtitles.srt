1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,416
Goodness.

3
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,544
Why are we making such a fuss
out of a contest?

4
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,546
They should just hold a scholarly contest.

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,967
I do not understand why he is holding
the contest outside of the palace walls.

6
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,720
If you do not feel confident,
remove your son's identification plaque.

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,601
One must be superior at everything

8
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,354
for him to become the Crown Prince
who will take charge of his kingdom.

9
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,190
Your Majesty.

10
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,693
There seemed to be a problem
with the method, so we had a chat.

11
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,320
Please do not say that.

12
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,281
If you do not fancy the method,

13
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,326
then your son may drop out of the contest.

14
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,081
Would you like to withdraw Prince Bogeom?

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,463
If the safety of the princes
or anything else concerns you,

16
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,924
you may remove the plaque now.

17
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,427
I hear your position…

18
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,640
as the Queen is at stake
in this contest. Is it true?

19
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,268
Yes, it is true.

20
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,063
If none of the Grand Princes is selected,

21
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,066
I will step down as queen.

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,903
Why? Would you like
to bet your position too?

23
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:58,910
How could my humble position
compare to yours, Your Majesty?

24
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,247
Consort Hwang.

25
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,374
Even if

26
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,502
one of my Grand Princes
ascends the throne,

27
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,673
I will make sure you keep your position.

28
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,930
I need the Third Senior Consort,
the Fourth Junior Consort,

29
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,892
and the First Junior Consort

30
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,813
to let my position as the Queen
shine even brighter.

31
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,610
I only hope the Grand Princes
will prove their competence

32
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,323
so that you will keep
your position as the Queen.

33
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,581
The Queen might be replaced as well
at this rate.

34
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,124
You are right.

35
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,836
It will depend on
who becomes the Crown Prince.

36
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,754
Then whom shall I side with?

37
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,090
Consort Hwang, of course.

38
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,593
Considering the support of the officials
and his age,

39
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,012
-Prince Uiseong is the most promising.
-No.

40
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,806
Prince Bogeom shall not be disregarded

41
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,934
-if you only consider their competence.
-Not Prince Bogeom!

42
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,896
Think of how we treated Consort Tae
with contempt and disdain.

43
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,523
I am not pleased with your conversation.

44
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,902
Why do you not consider
Prince Simso at all?

45
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,324
We will all be doomed once the bloodbath
begins if we choose the wrong side.

46
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,792
What is it?

47
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,764
You must hit the target
five times within the allotted time

48
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:29,018
to qualify to compete
in the next round of the contest.

49
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,312
Pass!

50
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,091
When the wind blows,

51
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,635
close your eyes and feel the wind.

52
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,683
You do not fight against the wind.

53
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,935
You make use of it.

54
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,079
The key is

55
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,374
how boldly you ojojun.

56
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,294
OJOJUN: AIMING AWAY FROM THE TARGET
DUE TO THE CLIMATE AND OTHER SURROUNDINGS

57
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,725
100 POINTS!

58
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,642
90 POINTS!

59
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,602
80 POINTS!

60
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,229
During the contest,

61
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,275
you will not be considered princes,
but inspectors.

62
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,571
-Find Seo Ham-deok, give the royal edict…
-Find Seo Ham-deok, give the royal edict…

63
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,823
-Find Park Gyeong-u, give the royal edict…
-Find Park Gyeong-u, give the royal edict…

64
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,826
Find them, give them the royal edict,
and escort them in the palanquin.

65
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,037
You have four days.

66
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,955
Park Gyeong-u?

67
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,540
I hear there is Seo Ham-deok too.

68
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,459
How could he bring in the ones

69
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,379
who were opposed to this dynasty
and even refused to take office?

70
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,507
The King has completely lost it.

71
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,468
What do you think he is up to?

72
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,530
How far will you go?

73
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,741
To a place where they will
not be able to find me.

74
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,453
The contest assignments
are causing controversy,

75
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,831
so I am on the run.

76
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,334
These days,

77
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,462
I am often reminded
of your time as Crown Prince.

78
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,883
You confidently said that
once you become the King,

79
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:10,596
you would not mind anybody
and make your subjects work ceaselessly.

80
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,729
I was quite daring as the Crown Prince.

81
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,148
Yes.

82
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,357
That is why

83
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,526
I was very glad.

84
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,529
Because these assignments

85
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,157
seemed to be given
by that daring Crown Prince.

86
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,201
Indeed,

87
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,163
you know me best, My Queen.

88
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:41,169
A friend for life,
and a person I have relied on to hold out.

89
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,504
That is you, My Queen.

90
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,929
It would be wonderful
if you also had such a subject.

91
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,306
Back in the day,

92
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,310
I also had a friend
who shared the same ways.

93
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,229
Are you referring

94
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,607
to Park Gyeong-u?

95
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,152
He may have turned his back on you,

96
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,447
but he could be
a loyal subject of a Crown Prince.

97
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,782
Is that what you thought?

98
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,412
I cannot fool your eyes.

99
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,333
Over my life as the King,

100
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,336
it has been so hard

101
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,255
to discover great talents.

102
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,883
And it is even harder

103
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,136
to win such a great talent
over to my side.

104
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,724
That is why I wanted to give
the Crown Prince

105
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,393
a chance to personally invite a talent
who will be their subject.

106
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,773
However, Your Majesty,

107
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,650
I am concerned

108
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,737
that the contest may become overheated
and jeopardize the safety of the princes.

109
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,491
I am already prepared for that, My Queen.

110
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,503
So that shaman is accurate
as if he has already seen the future?

111
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,257
The prince

112
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,510
who will be crowned
as the Crown Prince is…

113
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,428
I can see him.

114
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,306
I can see.

115
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,993
Let me see its horseshoes.

116
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,667
When did you replace the horseshoes?

117
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,627
About 15 days ago.

118
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,837
Would you like this one?

119
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,258
No, its chin groove is too narrow.
It will end up gasping for breath.

120
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,801
I would like to see another one.

121
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,805
THE METICULOUS ONE!

122
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,726
I will take that horse.

123
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,238
THE DANGEROUS ONE!

124
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,366
Face Reader.

125
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,912
Do I have the face of a Crown Prince?

126
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,208
You probably guessed from the way I look.

127
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,002
I am actually a prince.

128
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,712
Right.

129
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,130
I see.

130
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,176
I do not wish in any way
to become the Crown Prince,

131
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,012
but I must become one
for the sake of my mother.

132
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,222
That is my worry.

133
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,892
I am sure it is.

134
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,270
I hate that boring life
of being locked up in the palace.

135
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,439
What if I continue in this contest

136
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,524
and really become the Crown Prince?

137
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,610
THE BRAZEN ONE!

138
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,112
Do not worry.

139
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,906
I do not see it in you.

140
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,199
However,

141
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,911
you are overflowing with luck in romance.

142
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,042
You will soon come across two women.

143
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,211
One of the women

144
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:14,131
will give you something more important
than any treasure.

145
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,467
I am already rich,
so I do not care for money.

146
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,179
It is something you cannot buy with money.

147
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,600
I hope you recognize
the woman of your fate.

148
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,770
The woman of my fate?

149
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,272
Who could it be?

150
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,735
Anyway, where is the posthouse?

151
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,326
My lady!

152
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,421
Are you…

153
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,881
the woman of my fate?

154
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,591
What?

155
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,890
HEINOUS TRAITOR SEO HAM-DEOK

156
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,475
What are you doing?

157
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,562
It is a serious crime
to destroy a traitor's composite.

158
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,689
His Majesty has pardoned him as of today.

159
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,486
THE DARING ONE!

160
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,280
It is him.

161
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,200
Do you know this handsome man
who ran off with my money?

162
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,245
What? He ran off with your money?
My older brother?

163
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,581
"Older brother"?

164
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,500
He is not someone who would do that.

165
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,129
I think so too,

166
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,924
but he did take the silver knife
my mother had bequeathed me.

167
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,678
If it was from your mother,
it must be dear to you.

168
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,096
Very much so.

169
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,848
So please tell me.

170
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,559
Where is your brother right now?

171
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,562
This horse is not well either.

172
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,732
They all must have had something wrong.
They are all sick.

173
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,443
I apologize, but you should visit
the next posthouse.

174
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,990
Then I will take that horse.

175
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:03,949
Pardon?

176
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,704
But that one is an untamed wild horse.

177
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,957
It will be difficult to control
unless you are excellent with horses.

178
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,793
I will befriend it starting now.

179
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,379
THE HANDSOME ONE?

180
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,132
THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE ONE!

181
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,504
This must get to Prince Uiseong
before he reaches Mount Gyeryong.

182
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,464
Hurry.

183
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,554
I have found information on Park Gyeong-u

184
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,722
in the records of the Ministry of Justice
and Sungkyunkwan.

185
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,976
Oh, my.

186
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,436
This is such useful information.

187
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,651
Prince Bogeom is highly competent,
but he has no officials to back him up,

188
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,611
so I partnered him up with them.

189
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,824
It feels very worthwhile
to see all of you working together.

190
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,578
Things have been so unfair until this day.

191
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,582
Once Prince Bogeom passes this assignment,

192
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,750
we will become even busier.

193
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:41,505
My son and I will do our best
to meet your expectations.

194
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,341
I would love
to chat some more with you over tea,

195
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,219
but I reckon you have no time to waste.

196
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,558
The concubines are making unusual moves.

197
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,727
Your Majesty.

198
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,687
Why are you so at peace?

199
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:02,026
Are you asking me
why I am embroidering in this situation?

200
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,444
Yes, Your Majesty.

201
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,864
Chief State Councilor and the
court officials are with Prince Uiseong.

202
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,951
Other subjects with the Queen Dowager
are starting to help Prince Bogeom.

203
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,662
How long will you sit on your hands?

204
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,205
I am not sitting on my hands.

205
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,749
I am doing something.

206
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,085
They are blatantly creating a fuss.

207
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,211
I need to do something.

208
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,422
Then you should really do something.

209
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,092
You are probably the only one
who is playing by the rules in the palace.

210
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,053
Do not worry.

211
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,806
I will not play by the rules
only to face defeat. I am not that naive.

212
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,851
I have faith in something too.

213
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,478
I am confident.

214
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,898
Brother taught me and trained me.

215
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,275
The Crown Prince taught me how to be one.

216
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,902
I believe my chances are high.

217
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,030
Very well.

218
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,493
Once we turn to the taekhyeon,

219
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,579
you must prove
that you are worthy of being crowned.

220
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,790
I am ready to face that.

221
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,543
However, I will do my best

222
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,421
to stop those who cheat.

223
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,923
You see,

224
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,511
it is much harder to play by the rules
than to resort to tricks.

225
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,349
Though I agree those who cheat
are much more hard-working and diligent.

226
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,398
All finished.

227
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,618
It is information on Park Gyeong-u.
It is over if someone catches it.

228
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,536
Do not worry.

229
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,373
She is quick and agile. She will pass it
to Prince Bogeom without getting caught.

230
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,334
Over there. It is her.

231
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,142
This is a written oath of our loyalty.

232
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,946
Oh, my.

233
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,116
I believe in sincerity,

234
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,869
not some piece of paper like this.

235
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,456
Prove your loyalty to me.

236
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,168
How shall we do that?

237
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,676
Prince Yeongmin

238
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,970
and Prince Hwapyeong

239
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,555
must give up on the contest.

240
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,607
Your Grace.

241
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,026
Court Lady Shin
from the Queen's quarters is here.

242
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,622
Since the princes suddenly left the palace
for the contest,

243
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,833
you all must be surprised and concerned.

244
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,922
That is why I prepared this
for the sake of your peace.

245
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,008
-Bring them in.
-Bring them in.

246
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,385
It must be refreshments.

247
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,612
Your Majesty.

248
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,823
What is all this?

249
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,035
As you can see,
a folding screen for embroidery.

250
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,289
You can each take up a panel
and begin embroidering.

251
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,667
An entire panel?

252
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,003
Yes, we must put in all of our hearts

253
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,548
to wish for the safe return
of our princes.

254
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,591
Once we are finished,

255
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,470
I am planning to gift it
to the new Crown Prince.

256
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,556
So please, do your best.

257
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,602
I am sure
it will also help you find peace.

258
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,647
But Your Majesty,

259
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,067
I do not think
embroidering will help us find peace.

260
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,652
It helped me.

261
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,952
Once I finished this,

262
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:26,874
the most tranquil peace
began to overflow in my heart.

263
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,503
Deciding the Crown Prince
is a serious matter.

264
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,884
The women of the palace
must put our hearts together too.

265
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:41,722
Do you wish for us to remain here
until we complete this?

266
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,265
That is correct.

267
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,317
If we are in need of more threads,

268
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,738
we can share them with one another,

269
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,574
and we can chat too.

270
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,826
Is this not wonderful?

271
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,370
I will put all my heart into it.

272
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,497
Yes, please do.

273
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,254
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

274
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,883
I do not have a child
whom I can wish for a safe return.

275
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:22,137
All of the children of His Majesty
are our children.

276
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,231
By the way,

277
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,568
I do not see Consort Ko.

278
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,700
Yes, I am coming.

279
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,369
I have enough room for this.

280
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,628
Over here!

281
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,838
Here.

282
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,760
I did not order anything.

283
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,470
We only serve hot soup with rice.

284
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,097
Eat it while it is hot.

285
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,431
Let me see.

286
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,318
I am sorry.

287
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,612
Is that all you can say after hitting me?

288
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,655
Is that so?

289
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,491
Get up. Come here.

290
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,371
THE TIMID ONE!

291
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,540
Why are you doing this?

292
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,791
Why are you doing this?

293
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,056
Mother.

294
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,144
What are you doing here?

295
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,483
No matter where you are,
look sharp to be treated nicely.

296
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,278
Always keep your garments neat.

297
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,781
If you wish to take a step closer
to the crown,

298
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,701
you must be at least ten steps
ahead of the other princes.

299
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,537
Who are you looking for?

300
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,917
I am looking for Seo Ham-deok.

301
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,086
Here is information on him.

302
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,175
But this goes against the rules.

303
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,387
Do you think the others
are any different from me?

304
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,430
No.

305
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,224
They all do these things
behind others' backs.

306
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,976
-But…
-Silence.

307
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,354
Travel without stopping
at taverns or posthouses.

308
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:41,068
The only way for you to beat the other
princes is to get there earlier than them.

309
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,991
If you take the shortcut through An-eup,

310
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,952
you will arrive at Mount Gyeryong
a few hours early.

311
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,456
I put everything I have into you.

312
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,334
So do not disappoint me.

313
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,007
Report to me immediately
once Consort Ko arrives.

314
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,967
Do not let them leave even for a second.

315
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,344
Yes, Your Majesty.

316
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,365
I must relieve myself.

317
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,868
A seolgi, chamber pot,
is prepared next door.

318
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,703
If you must go, please.

319
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,623
Forget it.

320
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,970
Just finish embroidering quickly.

321
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,763
Then you will be able to leave.

322
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,060
Embroidery is just an excuse.

323
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,104
We are practically locked up.

324
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,566
Why is she suddenly
telling us to embroider?

325
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,529
Her Majesty has tied our hands and feet.

326
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,741
Were you going to do something
if your hands and feet were not tied up?

327
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,161
It looked like you went out this morning.

328
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,580
Consort Tae.

329
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,623
Do you have a lot of free time?

330
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,044
I cannot afford to have any free time.
I am wanted here and there.

331
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,004
Right.

332
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,757
Consort Tae, what did you discuss
with the Queen Dowager this morning?

333
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,509
We just had a chat over tea.

334
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,095
She asked me to stop by often from now on.

335
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,392
In that case, is she giving her support
to Prince Bogeom?

336
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,435
Well,

337
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:42,689
Prince Bogeom has always been bright,
so she has adored him since childhood.

338
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,399
Consort Tae.

339
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,195
After a handful of attention
from the Queen Dowager,

340
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,113
you have become frivolous

341
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,282
and blinded.

342
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,661
Who knows if it will be
a handful or a hefty amount?

343
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,750
Right.

344
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,045
Have Prince Yeongmin and Prince Hwapyeong
given up on the contest?

345
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,927
Oh, my, they must have given up.

346
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,183
Come to think of it, even the princes
who are of age have given up,

347
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,852
but that young Prince Hodong
continues to contend.

348
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,395
He is quite commendable.

349
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,983
I was worried about
how he would manage out there,

350
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,527
as he is a boy who needs five meals a day.

351
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,115
Who would have known that
he was a boy with such great ambition?

352
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,832
Prince Hodong, do you wish
to become the Crown Prince?

353
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,212
I just want to eat
a lot of good food before I return.

354
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,213
What about you?

355
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,675
Now that I am out here,
I would like to meet Master Munpil.

356
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,218
Who is that?

357
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,594
My icon.

358
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,972
He is the best astronomer in Joseon.

359
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,225
Then you will not
take part in the contest?

360
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,060
No, I am headed to Haeseo.

361
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,311
HAESEO: OLD NAME OF HWANGHAE PROVINCE

362
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,021
Will you come with me?

363
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,566
Then you can manage on your own.

364
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,944
Haeseo is really famous for its dumplings.

365
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,862
It is your loss.

366
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,865
Did you just say dumplings?

367
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,576
When I take a bite of moist dumplings,

368
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,621
the rich broth will flow out.

369
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,415
Will you join me?

370
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,627
JUST LITTLE KIDS!

371
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,177
I do not know who you are,

372
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,261
but thank you.

373
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,190
Follow His Royal Highness.

374
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,984
Protect him from danger,
but you are not allowed to intervene.

375
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,446
The rest, gather evidence
and remove the bodies.

376
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,372
He is Yi Eok-geun, a robber.

377
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,928
Why will you not move?

378
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,679
Let us go!

379
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,600
Let us go. Come on.

380
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,028
Let us go!

381
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,741
Let us go.

382
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,163
Goodness.

383
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,208
Your horse looks very sturdy.

384
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,128
Who are you people?

385
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,005
Who do you think we are?

386
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,050
Can you not tell?

387
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,261
All of you.

388
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,764
I am an inspector.

389
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,391
Step back at once!

390
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,392
Sure.

391
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,936
-I will take that too.
-I told you to step back!

392
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,021
Yes, sure, Lord Inspector.

393
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,607
We will go away now.

394
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,110
-Farewell, my lord.
-Goodbye.

395
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,236
Thank you.

396
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,612
Let us go.

397
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,035
Here. Go and have some hot soup with rice.

398
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,787
Wait…

399
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,173
Cho-wol!

400
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,843
I came to see you before my long journey.

401
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,720
Cho-wol!

402
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,224
Young master.

403
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,478
Did you come
after hearing the news of Cho-wol?

404
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,523
I am glad you came.

405
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,859
You need to stop her.

406
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,569
I said no.

407
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,488
You begged me to teach you
how to play an instrument, so I did.

408
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,574
But you cannot be a courtesan.

409
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,620
I have already made up my mind.

410
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,747
Cho-wol said

411
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,041
she will become a courtesan?

412
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,927
Do you mean I must complete this

413
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,845
-to leave this chamber?
-Yes.

414
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,516
Consort Ko, you started off late,
so you better hurry.

415
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,357
Consort Hwang.

416
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,692
Why are you not embroidering?

417
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,865
I cannot seem
to paint a picture in my head.

418
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,827
What will suit the new Crown Prince best?

419
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,581
I cannot seem to think of it.

420
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,377
It is not that
this task is too difficult to begin.

421
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:47,382
It is difficult
because you have not begun, is it not?

422
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,678
If I cannot complete what I begin,

423
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,639
what is the point?

424
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,187
Your Majesty.

425
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,163
Consort Ko, where have you been?

426
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,962
I heard of my father's illness
and went to visit him in a hurry.

427
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,506
Are you sure?

428
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,684
I did not find much today.

429
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,357
Is there a man
named Park Gyeong-u on this island?

430
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,483
Goodness.

431
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,236
Is he also here to take Master Hyomyeong?

432
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,404
Watch your mouth.

433
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,325
What does this concern?

434
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,870
I am here to escort him
on the orders of the King.

435
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,459
Who would dare to attack
Grand Prince Seongnam?

436
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,503
A group of bandits
led by a man named Yi Eok-geun.

437
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,051
These red arrowheads
are a symbol of that group.

438
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,351
So he was attacked by bandits?

439
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,564
Yes, their leader, Yi Eok-geun,
was found dead on the scene.

440
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,526
If it were not for the Palace Guards,

441
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,154
Grand Prince Seongnam
could have lost his life.

442
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,157
No…

443
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,911
This was not done by some bandits.

444
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,038
Hey.

445
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,165
It is dangerous here. Take another route.

446
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,418
Hurry.

447
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,758
All right.

448
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,722
Goodness, what is with you all?

449
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,391
I mean, it is not like there is no boat.

450
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,228
The water is still too. Let us cross over.

451
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,356
How many times do I have to tell you?
We cannot go today.

452
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,024
You are driving us crazy!

453
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,819
If we cannot go in,
what are we going to do?

454
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,862
Has the government office placed a ban?

455
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,656
Pardon?

456
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,865
No, well…

457
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,161
Anyway, I am not sailing today,
so please return.

458
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,704
-Move aside.
-Come on!

459
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,998
-Just let us cross!
-What is with you?

460
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,375
-Please!
-Come on!

461
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,168
-What is with you?
-Let us cross over.

462
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,965
-He is driving us insane.
-What do we do?

463
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,550
What is wrong with him?

464
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,467
My goodness.

465
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,102
Hey, you are going to get yourself killed!

466
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,228
Wait…

467
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,992
Kang.

468
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,203
Will you be able to replace your brother?

469
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,874
What I mean is,
you must become the Crown Prince.

470
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,868
I solved it, Master.

471
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,913
Let me see.

472
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,874
If I add 46 to 28, it is 74.

473
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,210
Precisely. You have done well.

474
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,461
Excellent.

475
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,592
Then I will teach you
how to express hundreds and thousands.

476
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,677
Bring 20 counting sticks.

477
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,557
Master, Yeon-ji lost her box of sticks,
so she does not have any.

478
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,017
Why would you tell him that?

479
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,020
That is rather troublesome.

480
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,440
How am I going to teach you the method
without counting sticks?

481
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,817
Ones, vertical.

482
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,444
Tens, horizontal.

483
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,781
Hundreds will rise
and thousands will fall.

484
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,076
Who are you to meddle with my class?

485
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,787
I am an inspector
who is here to escort you.

486
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,581
It is very significant to see

487
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,084
how a straw mat can turn
the street into a village school.

488
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,379
But how would you like to use your wisdom
for the sake of the kingdom?

489
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,053
"Hear, Park Gyeong-u."

490
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,806
"You are hereby appointed
as Minister of Taxation."

491
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,766
"Accept the edict immediately,

492
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,810
take the palanquin,
and come to the palace."

493
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,854
Minister of Taxation?

494
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,566
-This is a royal command.
-Enough with the nonsense.

495
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,112
He may be your king, but he is not mine.

496
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,571
Very well.

497
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,700
Let me teach you how to express hundreds.

498
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,034
Remove the counting sticks.

499
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,995
Minister of Taxation?

500
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,331
How could His Majesty appoint someone
who left him out of spite?

501
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,251
Also, traitor Seo Ham-deok will be
the head of the Royal Commandery Division.

502
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,669
How can he appoint him

503
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,713
without consulting me,
the Minister of War?

504
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,839
We must stop him.

505
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,883
We especially cannot bring
Seo Ham-deok back to the palace.

506
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,677
What do you mean?

507
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,722
He must return to the palace
for Prince Uiseong to be crowned.

508
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,849
Did you forget
the Minister of Personnel and I

509
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,310
annihilated all of Seo Ham-deok's family?

510
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,062
Chief State Councilor,
will you sit quietly like this?

511
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,273
We did what we did on your orders.

512
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,818
You are sitting there on this day
only because you did that much.

513
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,867
Chief State Councilor.

514
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,453
His Majesty wishes to see you.

515
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,667
Do you know what this is?

516
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,548
This is the arrow that threatened
Grand Prince Seongnam's life

517
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,300
during the contest.

518
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,677
Your Majesty.

519
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,973
Are you doubting my loyalty to you?

520
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,352
I gave you a chance
because I know how loyal you are.

521
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,145
If I did not,

522
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,856
I would have crowned a direct heir
without this contest.

523
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,692
Did you just say "chance"?

524
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,573
You are calling in a man who rejected you
to leave the economy of the kingdom to him

525
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,367
and appointing the son of the traitor

526
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,494
as the head of the
Royal Commandery Division.

527
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,913
Is that what you call giving me a chance?

528
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,373
So are you saying…

529
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,669
you know nothing at all about this arrow?

530
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,132
How could a loyal subject of Your Majesty

531
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,594
dare to go after a Grand Prince's life?

532
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,347
-Who would dare to--
-Whoever dared

533
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,683
to go after the Grand Prince's life

534
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,853
will be revealed by me
and I will make sure of that.

535
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,151
Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,029
Please get to the bottom of it.

537
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,409
It is only proper
that the truth is revealed.

538
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,956
It should not be left as a mystery,
unlike the death of Crown Prince Taein.

539
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,320
You were there when it happened.

540
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,365
So you know very well what I mean.

541
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,701
Are you…

542
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,412
threatening me right now?

543
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,874
Not at all, Your Majesty.

544
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,920
All I wish to do is find out the truth.

545
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,965
Therefore,

546
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,343
I hope you do everything you can

547
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,555
to get to the bottom of the incident
of Grand Prince Seongnam.

548
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,723
However, I am afraid

549
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,853
some may take your actions as a means
of asserting Your Majesty's influence

550
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,439
over the contest.

551
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,526
For at times,

552
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,070
the truth is created.

553
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,536
I was informed
you stopped the investigation

554
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,413
against those who attacked
Grand Prince Seongnam.

555
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,207
I am not stopping it.

556
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,335
I will resume the investigation
after the contest is over.

557
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,170
After the contest,

558
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,880
you will lose the witnesses

559
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,216
and whatever evidence is left,
Your Majesty.

560
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,885
This arrow is the only evidence.

561
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,429
If I push ahead,
it will only provoke the officials.

562
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,558
It is obvious they will protest
and say I am trying to affect the contest.

563
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,102
These people were
after Grand Prince Seongnam's life.

564
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,772
My child could have died.

565
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,191
I am his father too.

566
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:10,361
Yet I am the father of the subjects
and the people of this kingdom.

567
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,946
I am not saying I will not do it.

568
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,657
I am simply postponing it.

569
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,492
Can you not understand, My Queen?

570
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,578
I do. I understand you completely.

571
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,247
However,

572
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,457
your son could have died.

573
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,042
Are you saying

574
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,504
you are hesitant because of the ones
who may have killed your son?

575
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,387
How can a father
who cannot protect his own son

576
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,056
protect the people of his kingdom?

577
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,143
I will not let the ones
who tried to hurt my son

578
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,979
live to see another day.

579
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,363
I will do this as a mother of my children,

580
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,532
not as the Queen.

581
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,118
I will not harm Your Majesty in any way.

582
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,508
You must return.

583
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,594
Do not harass me anymore.

584
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,598
I will not return
until I have finished my assignment.

585
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,060
He used the power of disloyal subjects
to become the King, so that is that.

586
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,313
What does he want to do at this point?

587
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,647
I agree.

588
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,612
Who are you?

589
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,822
Are you another inspector?

590
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,741
Yes, you consider the royal edict

591
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,119
as something less important than dog feces
so he sent two inspectors for you.

592
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,832
However, you must take
only one edict between us two.

593
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,920
Inspectors, are you in a contest?

594
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,423
Forget that.

595
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,468
Even if one hundred inspectors
come for me,

596
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,094
I am not going.

597
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,473
I heard you and His Majesty
were close friends on the same side.

598
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,975
But you were against his enthronement

599
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,102
because he was a child of a concubine.

600
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,522
Was politics more important
than your friend's cause?

601
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,565
Politics?

602
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,320
It is only your prejudice
to divide people by left and right.

603
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,614
If you do not care
about politics or principles,

604
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,116
why do you continue
to turn down his royal command?

605
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,453
Both my eyes do not work,
so I cannot see anything.

606
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,831
Even if I went to the palace
and had a good look,

607
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,792
how could I discern anything?

608
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,795
So you can go and tell him

609
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,672
that I am blind

610
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,467
and cannot even be an adjunct overseer,
let alone the Minister of Taxation.

611
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,264
What if I can prove
that you can still see?

612
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,645
If I do prove it,
give me three days of time.

613
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,692
Very well then.

614
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,321
What will you do
if you are unable to prove it?

615
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,158
I will leave the island with him.

616
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,160
Wait, why should I go?

617
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,296
I lost.

618
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,178
I will leave just as I promised.

619
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,393
Look here!

620
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,149
What are you doing?

621
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,360
Did your eyes open

622
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,862
after seeing a lunatic?

623
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,824
These lunatics who see
nothing but what they want

624
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,742
came for this blind man!

625
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,119
Goodness gracious!

626
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,171
Are you not going to help me?

627
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,759
Hey!

628
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,723
Hey!

629
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,632
This is the body of the leader,
Yi Eok-geun.

630
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,013
Why is his neck swollen?

631
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,014
Pardon?

632
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,309
His neck was not that swollen
during the autopsy.

633
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,228
-Check it.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

634
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,712
This foreign substance absorbed water
and became swollen.

635
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,436
PILSAL: KILL AT ALL COSTS

636
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,190
Is this not a composite
of Grand Prince Seongnam?

637
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,572
They were not simple bandits.

638
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,200
They were clearly
after Grand Prince Seongnam's life.

639
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,921
Does anyone here know what this arrow is?

640
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,179
I did not want any princes

641
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,434
to be wounded or hurt in this contest.

642
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,645
However,

643
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,691
someone went after
Grand Prince Seongnam's life.

644
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,534
A group of bandits
led by a man named Yi Eok-geun.

645
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,787
This is under investigation,

646
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,041
so I will soon find out
who is behind this.

647
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,377
I captured the remaining bandits.

648
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,810
That is enough for today.

649
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,979
You may all return.

650
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,841
Who on earth tried to kill
Grand Prince Seongnam?

651
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,385
Perhaps it was Consort Ko.

652
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,220
She went out today.

653
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,062
What on earth is going on?

654
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,484
Your Majesty,
you kept them here for a reason.

655
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,278
If you let them go now,
they may do something else again.

656
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:53,990
And why did you show them the arrow?

657
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:57,953
If I were the suspect,
I would destroy the remaining evidence.

658
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,163
That is exactly why I showed them.

659
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,540
Pardon?

660
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,544
If anybody knows anything about the arrow,

661
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,672
they will want to know how much I know

662
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,883
and if I have any other evidence.

663
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,388
That is why I misinformed them
that I captured Yi Eok-geun's men.

664
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,642
Then did you let the concubines go
on purpose?

665
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,269
That is right.

666
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,980
The first one to leave the palace

667
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,691
will lead you to the suspect.

668
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,695
You will be able to find the lead

669
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,906
to capture the rest of the bandits
that ran off.

670
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,995
What do you mean
the subleader has disappeared?

671
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:43,248
It seems that they were indeed after
Grand Prince Seongnam's life.

672
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,293
We told them to act as robbers
to simply hold him back.

673
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,336
I am suspecting that
someone may have intervened.

674
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,339
Who would intervene
and ruin everything like this?

675
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,842
I may end up taking the blame!

676
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,302
My apologies.

677
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:59,181
Do whatever it takes
to find the subleader.

678
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,476
I must find out who intervened.

679
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,856
Chief State Councilor
is also after the subleader.

680
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,983
What do you mean by that?

681
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,526
That means…

682
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,279
they had a falling out.

683
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,118
I must find the subleader
to shed light upon this.

684
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,497
However, he has completely disappeared
without a trace.

685
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,125
In that case,

686
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,671
Chief State Councilor's men
will become hunting dogs for us.

687
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:37,302
All we have to do is tail them
to find the subleader.

688
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,639
However,

689
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,934
we must get our hands on him first.

690
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,491
May I use this room?

691
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,827
Look at that…

692
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,496
Good grief.

693
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,084
Prince Bogeom, I did not think
you would really leave.

694
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,838
I thought of the gains and losses.

695
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,551
However, not saving you
was more advantageous for me.

696
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,345
How can you think of that
when I almost died?

697
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,308
It was your choice to jump off the cliff.

698
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,978
Also, if I saved you,

699
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:32,190
it would go against the contest rule
that says we cannot accept any help.

700
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,193
If you are going to be so calculative,

701
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,862
why are you sponging off me?

702
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,824
I am the one who proved that
Park Gyeong-u is not blind,

703
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,951
and I also got
three days of time from him.

704
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:53,962
What are you doing?

705
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,672
I must sleep before haesi.

706
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,299
HAESI: TWENTY-FIRST HOUR TO TWENTY-THIRD

707
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,053
What are you doing?

708
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,764
I have never slept before then.

709
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,935
I am cold.

710
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,228
I am hot.

711
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,569
Why three days?

712
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,821
What is your plan?

713
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,073
Plan? I do not have one.

714
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,701
We only have three days anyway.

715
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,786
I will do whatever it takes.

716
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,206
What is your plan?

717
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,961
At any rate, we are too different.

718
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,765
What an odd taste
Master Park Gyeong-u has.

719
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,483
One day has passed.

720
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,278
Once these fish are gone,

721
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:01,988
may you be gone as well.

722
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,471
Goodness.

723
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,557
Do you usually catch
this many ocean quahogs here?

724
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,394
Yes, they are in season right now.

725
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,445
-Look.
-Did you get another one?

726
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,578
Young lady, is that not the man?

727
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,372
The man in that drawing.

728
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,500
He looks exactly like the drawing.

729
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,294
My lord!

730
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,838
My lord!

731
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,050
This is from Lady Cheong-ha.

732
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,933
My lord!

733
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,603
Father, you always told me

734
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,982
a man should have high ambitions
once he is born,

735
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:24,029
and a woman should have
great insight to recognize such a man.

736
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,994
I, your eldest daughter,
will take a journey upon your words.

737
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,747
I found the man I wish to marry.

738
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,710
Why did you not come that day?

739
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,962
I waited so long for you.

740
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,886
What are you doing?

741
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,596
Do you not remember me?

742
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,639
The knife at the dispensary.

743
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,227
You recognize me.

744
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,854
I really missed you.

745
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,736
My name is Yoon Cheong-ha.

746
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,529
What is your name?

747
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,288
I must find them and shut their mouths

748
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,332
before the Queen finds more evidence.

749
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,627
I am after them right now,
so do not worry.

750
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,004
I kept His Majesty tied down.

751
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,590
There is nothing the Queen can do alone.

752
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,758
No.

753
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,803
The Queen is the one
who can make His Majesty take action.

754
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,264
I cannot rest assured
until I drag her down.

755
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,976
The Queen…

756
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,313
still holds great power.

757
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,073
This is very nice.

758
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,369
Goodness, welcome. How may I help you?

759
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,622
Have you seen this man?

760
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,672
I do not know him.

761
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,822
Give me a moment, will you?

762
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,950
I still have my skills from my glory days.

763
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,660
-Oh, my.
-After him!

764
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,783
Please spare me!

765
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,036
Please spare my life.

766
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,965
If I were going to spare you,
I would not have found you.

767
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:19,305
I am wondering what I can do
to give you the most tormenting death.

768
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,599
Why are you doing this to me?

769
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,643
Please spare my life.

770
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,855
If you tell me everything that happened
in Mount Gangun,

771
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,693
you may live to see a few more days.

772
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,112
I only did as I was told.

773
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,947
I do not know anything.

774
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,579
If you wish to live,

775
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,123
tell me everything

776
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,292
you saw and heard.

777
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,252
On that day,

778
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,546
someone came to me in haste.

779
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:55,216
Horses and money.
Take everything they have.

780
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,218
Here is one hundred nyang.

781
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,136
Should I…

782
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,306
take their lives too?

783
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,058
No, they cannot be hurt in any way.

784
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,436
It must look like a simple robbery.

785
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,812
Then why?

786
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:08,938
Why did you

787
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,025
try to kill one of them?

788
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,861
What do you mean?

789
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,488
We just tried to rob them.

790
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,659
We were raided by another group,
so all we did was run away.

791
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,375
Have you seen this before?

792
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:34,047
Who gave you this composite?

793
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,135
All I did was
what the leader told me to do.

794
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,221
I do not know anything else.

795
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,185
You do not know anything else?

796
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,066
Then you leave me no choice.

797
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,327
Someone else came right after.

798
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,287
She was a woman.

799
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:10,249
That woman heard the order
from the man who came before her,

800
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,795
then made another request to us.

801
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,762
So what exactly are you looking for?

802
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,687
PILSAL

803
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,614
When that woman with a frog hairpin
passed by me,

804
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,908
I smelled peony.

805
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,287
Did you…

806
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,957
just say peony?

807
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:13,312
Your Royal Highness, Her Majesty is here.

808
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,110
Let her in.

809
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,127
Your Royal Highness,

810
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,671
allow me to apologize for my misconduct.

811
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:43,342
Filial impiety
is the gravest sin of them all.

812
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,637
But I have shown you
nothing but disrespect.

813
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,434
What are you up to?

814
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,061
I am here to apologize
to my mother-in-law.

815
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,939
What other motive could I hold?

816
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,033
This is a small gift from me to you.

817
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,052
Is this not a cuckoo pint?

818
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,597
How could you present
a poisonous plant to me?

819
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,520
I dearly wish

820
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,273
you would live all of your years.

821
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,567
That way,

822
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,779
you will receive my devotion
for a long time.

823
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,535
I do not think that is something you say
while giving me a poisonous plant.

824
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:55,373
Whether this will turn into
medicine or poison

825
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,000
is up to you.

826
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:02,213
If you hurt the Grand Princes once again,

827
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,257
I will

828
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,301
decoct this cuckoo pint myself
and give it to you.

829
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:12,056
How dare you threaten your mother-in-law?

830
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:26,404
You ordered them
to end the Grand Prince's life for good

831
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:31,284
through a court lady
who smelled like peony.

832
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,373
I am not threatening you.

833
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,794
I am giving you a chance
to ask for forgiveness.

834
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:46,257
Those bandits are in my hands.

835
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,383
Therefore,

836
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,970
you must stop here.

837
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,806
If you take one more step,

838
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,891
I shall…

839
01:04:55,641 --> 01:05:00,605
expose every immoral thing
you have committed against your grandson

840
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,400
and make you pay the price.

841
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,177
Please…

842
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,598
preserve your health.

843
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:48,110
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

844
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:17,264
Think about it carefully.
You never know what can happen.

845
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,600
Does it not seem like all the money
he made from selling ocean quahogs

846
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,228
and the store are going into his pocket?

847
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,855
The villagers sometimes come here to pray.

848
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,232
But I feel rather reluctant…

849
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:29,527
I am here to reveal the ugly truth
behind Grand Prince Gyeseong.

850
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,821
Were you waiting for me?

851
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:35,032
She told me I should not have returned
even if I stopped breathing.

852
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:38,869
Do not think my hands and feet are tied.

853
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:42,665
I am afraid there will come a time
for you and I to work together.

854
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:48,379
