1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,886
You mean the Crown Prince has been
in the palace all this time?

3
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,596
Yes, Your Majesty.

4
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,683
Then what were you doing
while he became so ill?

5
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,978
What were you doing…

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,690
while keeping all this from me?

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,151
Your Majesty,
the diagnosis is hyeolheogwol.

8
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,487
HYEOLHEOGWOL: A DISEASE CAUSED
BY BLOOD DEFICIENCY AND FATIGUE

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,863
Did you say…

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,201
hyeolheogwol?

11
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,703
Yes, Your Majesty. I am certain of it.

12
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,460
Examine him again. I cannot be.

13
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,920
Examine him again now!

14
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,172
Unfortunately,

15
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,633
the disease seems
to be in an advanced stage.

16
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:36,930
The condition of His Royal Highness
is extremely critical.

17
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,477
Is what he said true?

18
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,148
Were you aware that it was hyeolheogwol?

19
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,901
I beg for your mercy, Your Majesty!

20
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,511
EPISODE 5

21
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,983
Perhaps the tide will turn.

22
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,786
I have terrible news!

23
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,459
Something dreadful happened.

24
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,461
The Crown Prince collapsed at Sigangwon.

25
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,671
My goodness.

26
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,550
-How did it happen?
-I thought he had recovered.

27
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,928
His Royal Highness collapsed.

28
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,847
-He even coughed up blood.
-Blood?

29
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,390
-Yes.
-How awful.

30
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,238
No acupuncture.

31
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,615
There is no time to lose, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,618
The Crown Prince
has a history of hemophilia.

33
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,494
Acupuncture should be avoided

34
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,788
when there has been heavy bleeding.

35
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,084
Step away from the Crown Prince, My Queen.

36
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,715
-Your Majesty.
-Step away from him now.

37
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,344
Starting now,

38
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,139
I shall punish those who harmed
the health of the Crown Prince

39
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,391
and acted without my order.

40
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,354
Chief Palace Guard!

41
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,271
Yes, Your Majesty.

42
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,069
Imprison Physician Kwon.

43
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,447
Starting today, the Queen
will stay in her quarters.

44
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,200
She will also be suspended
from all her duties,

45
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,994
including the supervision
of the ladies of the royal palace.

46
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,041
Physician Cho,
establish an Emergency Royal Clinic

47
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,542
with the Chief State Councilor
as the head.

48
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,835
Yes, Your Majesty.

49
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,254
From now on,

50
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,715
no one may see the Crown Prince
without my permission.

51
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,218
You are not an exception, My Queen.

52
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,845
Your Majesty.

53
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,724
I will obey whatever orders you give me

54
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,603
and accept whatever punishment
you impose on me,

55
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,272
but please, Your Majesty…

56
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,899
At least allow me to see the Crown Prince.

57
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,112
Step aside.

58
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,657
Please go back. His Majesty forbade us
from letting just anybody in.

59
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,992
"Just anybody"?

60
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,160
QUARTERS OF THE CROWN PRINCE

61
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,037
My brother collapsed.

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,455
Can I at least see him?

63
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,040
What is going on here?

64
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,881
Do you

65
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,219
intend to defy the orders of His Majesty?

66
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,056
Go back.

67
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,519
Now!

68
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,486
We just want to know how our brother is.

69
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,574
How is that defying Father?

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,659
I need to know.

71
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,661
How is my brother doing?

72
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,506
You have not changed a bit.

73
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,551
Have I not always told you
to swallow it down?

74
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,971
Is it not time
you adjusted yourself to life

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,973
in the palace?

76
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,227
Turn a blind eye to things you see,

77
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,438
forget things you hear,

78
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,358
and if there is something you wish to say,
keep your mouth shut…

79
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,197
if you wish to protect
what is precious to you.

80
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:24,467
QUARTERS OF THE QUEEN

81
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,105
In addition to worrying
about His Royal Highness,

82
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,191
she must transcribe Dodeokgyeong
and Confucius texts as punishment.

83
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,277
Your Majesty.

84
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,155
There is no need to hurry.

85
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,241
His Majesty gave you five days.

86
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,243
You should slow down.

87
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,586
I feel so bad for Her Majesty.

88
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,215
She must be heartbroken.

89
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,760
One would think the palace is in mourning.

90
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,012
Do not even say that.

91
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,141
You have no idea

92
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,103
how close I was with the Crown Prince
when he was a child.

93
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:22,108
Right. You must have seen him frequently
while you were serving Her Majesty.

94
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:31,284
In any case, we are not in the position
to be sitting and weeping.

95
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,202
As the ladies of the royal palace,

96
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,455
we should worry
about the future of the kingdom.

97
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,668
The disease that the Crown Prince
is suffering from…

98
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,378
My goodness.

99
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:47,008
It is the same disease that caused
the untimely death of Crown Prince Taein.

100
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,886
-Oh, my.
-Good heavens.

101
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,473
While pretending he was away,

102
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:58,436
the Queen was secretly having
the Crown Prince treated in her quarters.

103
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,647
She deceived His Majesty and tampered
with the body of the Crown Prince.

104
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,065
That is not all.

105
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,401
She left him half-dead.

106
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,280
Therefore, it might not simply end
with confinement.

107
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,041
Her position never suited her.

108
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,502
It was bound to go wrong.

109
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,631
By the way, how did His Majesty
become the Crown Prince

110
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,925
when his mother was not even the Queen?

111
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,760
It was due to the taekhyeon.

112
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,638
Taekhyeon?

113
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:38,434
It is to select the wisest one as the
Crown Prince regardless of his legitimacy.

114
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,313
Prince Bogeom, who became the cohort,
must stand the best chance then.

115
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,984
He surpassed Prince Uiseong
and all the Grand Princes academically.

116
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,822
The Grand Princes are still more likely
to inherit the throne.

117
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,035
I reckon one of them
will be the next Crown Prince.

118
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,458
Perhaps not. Maybe the son
of the Crown Prince will.

119
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,186
Your Majesty.

120
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,023
Did you stay up all night?

121
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,486
Why are you going this far?

122
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,824
Send for the chief eunuch.

123
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,783
Pardon?

124
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,910
Hurry. I am finished.

125
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,787
He may collect my transcripts.

126
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,587
How did you transcribe all of them?

127
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,798
How is the Crown Prince doing?

128
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,346
You accompany Your Majesty all the time,
so you must have seen him.

129
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,556
Your Majesty.

130
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,350
His Majesty forbade me from telling--

131
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,851
Can you not even tell me?

132
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,103
I am his mother.

133
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,148
I need to know his condition

134
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,902
to decide if I should cry,
be relieved, pray, or lose my mind.

135
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,029
I need to know.

136
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,864
Your Majesty, I--

137
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,492
To hell with duties, virtues, or ethics!

138
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,661
Is my son alive?

139
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,249
Yes, he is, Your Majesty.

140
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,128
Is he conscious?

141
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,717
Has he regained consciousness?

142
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,179
No, he has not, Your Majesty.

143
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,354
Chief Eunuch.

144
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,482
Listen carefully.

145
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,609
Never leave the Crown Prince

146
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,405
alone with Royal Physician Cho Guk-yeong.

147
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,704
You must relay this to His Majesty.

148
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,500
The Crown Prince cannot be left alone
with any royal physician.

149
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,793
Do you understand?

150
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,962
I dare not…

151
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,007
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

152
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,385
I was mistaken.

153
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,679
I omitted a few Confucius texts.

154
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,808
I shall send for you again
when I am finished.

155
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,393
Your Majesty…

156
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,648
Bear in mind what I say.

157
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,443
The Crown Prince

158
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,070
must not be left alone with anyone.

159
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,587
Mother!

160
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,173
We are here! It is Grand Prince Ilyeong!

161
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,341
Brother is in critical condition.

162
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,844
How can we not be allowed
to see Mother or Brother?

163
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,265
I overheard servants of the court
whispering that he might not recover.

164
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,558
Who talked such nonsense

165
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,145
when no one can come near him
let alone check his condition?

166
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,856
What if something happens to him

167
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,525
and he leaves us
without even saying goodbye?

168
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,735
Watch what you say.

169
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,034
Say something ominous about Brother again,

170
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,244
and I will not let it slide.

171
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,372
My apologies.

172
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,375
That was not my intention.

173
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,794
Brother!

174
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,131
It is not your fault.

175
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,884
He must be on his way to Brother.

176
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,136
What about Father?

177
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,388
I was not granted an audience.

178
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,308
Father refuses to see us,

179
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,394
and Mother is banned from seeing us.

180
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,528
Are you on your way to the Crown Prince?

181
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,280
As if you will be let in.

182
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,994
I heard cnidium and peony were prescribed.

183
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,126
I knew it.

184
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,462
You had no idea.

185
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,800
I wonder if he will last two weeks.

186
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,846
Watch what you say.

187
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,057
Show some respect

188
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,976
if you want me to tell you more.

189
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,900
His condition is hopeless.

190
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,737
I do not know how he has been treated,

191
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,866
but I heard he even coughed up
blood clots.

192
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,160
Right.

193
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,204
You are not hoping

194
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,124
to take over his position
if something happens to him, are you?

195
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,501
You better not show it.

196
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,796
Should I not?

197
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,718
The same goes for you.

198
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,221
You should not go around snickering
when the Crown Prince is ill.

199
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,599
It is getting on my nerves.

200
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,990
We cannot defer it any longer.

201
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,034
We must make the deposition public.

202
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,036
If the Crown Prince recovers,

203
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,622
we may not get another chance
to turn the tide.

204
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,665
That is why we should hurry.

205
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,834
We must depose the Crown Prince

206
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:23,380
in order to take his son, the strongest
candidate, out of the picture.

207
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,592
His Majesty will not change
his mind easily.

208
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,513
We shall have the patriotic scholars
submit petitions.

209
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,059
We will become stronger
by uniting ourselves.

210
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:35,976
I agree.

211
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,894
Also,

212
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,355
to depose the Crown Prince,

213
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,775
we will need help from her.

214
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,444
The Chief State Councilor

215
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,322
will get in touch with you soon,
Minister Yoon.

216
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,287
Do not let him control you.
Make sure to gain the upper hand.

217
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,041
One's worth is determined
by the position that one holds.

218
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,878
You must stand your ground.

219
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,802
-What is that fire?
-What is that?

220
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,771
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

221
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,357
Who is it?

222
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,316
Mother.

223
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,776
It is Kang.

224
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,321
You should not be here.

225
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,033
If His Majesty finds out,
you will also be confined.

226
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,535
There is something I must ask.

227
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:21,290
Has Brother ever coughed up
eohyeol before?

228
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,374
EOHYEOL: BLOOD CLOTS

229
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,417
Eohyeol?

230
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,965
No, it has never happened before.

231
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,302
In that case,

232
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,097
the medicine I brought
must have been the cause.

233
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,265
That cannot be.

234
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,019
His symptoms improved
after taking that medicine.

235
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,563
He was definitely recovering.

236
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,236
Kang, listen carefully.

237
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,280
It is not your fault.

238
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,909
So be sure not to act rashly.

239
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,622
And most importantly,
no one can find out about

240
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,833
the prescription and medicine
brought from the outside.

241
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,378
Even if something goes wrong,

242
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,589
I will take care of it.

243
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,175
Do you understand?

244
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,236
What is he doing?

245
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,205
I apologize. You will wake up in ilgak.

246
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,206
ILGAK: 15 MINUTES

247
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,218
There was nothing particularly wrong
with the medicine itself.

248
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,971
However,

249
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,683
I cannot guarantee
that the medicine was not the cause.

250
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,101
What do you mean by that?

251
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,688
Even the same medicine
can have varying qualities.

252
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:12,359
Crow-dipper is a common remedy
for phlegm and coughing.

253
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,237
In the fourth month
of the lunar calendar, however,

254
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,031
it becomes so poisonous
that it can be lethal.

255
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,117
By the way,

256
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,871
who gave you that prescription?

257
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,249
A physician who wanders
around the villages.

258
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,796
Your Highness,
even if that medicine was not the cause,

259
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,466
administering medicine from the outside
to the Crown Prince can get me killed.

260
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,974
I will keep my mouth shut
about that medicine no matter what.

261
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,221
Do you have something more to say?

262
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,399
Whose orders are you following?

263
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,777
Orders?

264
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,570
What are you talking about?

265
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,656
Grand Prince Seongnam came to see you.

266
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,075
Is he the one you serve?

267
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,326
His Highness…

268
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,121
only inquired about
the condition of the Crown Prince.

269
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,500
Please spare me.

270
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,294
I will tell you everything.

271
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,546
Whose orders are you following?

272
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,760
I serve Her Majesty the Queen.

273
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,563
I cannot

274
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,650
tell you anything more, Your Majesty.

275
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,444
At least tell me if he stopped
coughing up blood.

276
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,364
-I do not know, Your Majesty.
-Chief Eunuch.

277
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,450
I regret to inform you

278
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,328
that His Majesty ordered

279
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,956
that you stop transcribing the texts.

280
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,083
Why?

281
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,128
Why so suddenly?

282
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,337
Why?

283
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,967
I would not presume to know
the intentions of His Majesty.

284
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,639
No matter how grave my sins are,

285
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,475
he should not do this.

286
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,561
My ill child
is only a stone's throw from me.

287
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,481
How could he forbid me
from doing anything?

288
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,983
Your Majesty…

289
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,153
I feel guilty…

290
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,497
even about breathing now.

291
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,793
So tell me the condition of my son!

292
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,171
I do not know, Your Majesty.

293
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,589
Chief Eunuch!

294
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,715
I swear…

295
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,718
I do not know anything, Your Majesty.

296
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,397
His Majesty

297
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,859
imposed the harshest
possible punishment on me.

298
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,445
Her Majesty

299
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,573
hid the Crown Prince in her quarters

300
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,326
and ordered me to treat him
while pretending he was away.

301
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,621
I thought I must follow her orders
to save the Crown Prince.

302
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,789
That is all.

303
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,250
All I did…

304
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,710
BANGSEO: PRESCRIPTION BOOK

305
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,296
…was treat hyeolheogwol
as instructed in the bangseo.

306
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,340
I swear.

307
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,269
What should we do with him?

308
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,314
I know one thing for certain now.

309
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,066
No one…

310
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,778
will be able to make him talk.

311
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,862
Keep him alive.

312
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,723
Mom!

313
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,313
I recognize you.

314
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,401
Is this how people these days
repay an act of kindness?

315
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,944
Tell me the truth.

316
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,196
Did you tamper with that medicine?

317
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,991
Did I tamper with it?
Why would I ever do such a thing?

318
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,786
Fine.

319
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,123
I did slightly overcharge you
for the medicine.

320
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,208
That I am guilty of.

321
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,085
But dear me, this is driving me crazy.

322
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,881
What on earth happened to your brother
to get you up to this in the middle of--

323
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,049
Listen carefully.

324
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:32,012
Your prescription harmed the yeche.

325
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,722
YECHE: HEALTH OF THE CROWN PRINCE

326
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,599
Yeche?

327
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,686
Who are you?

328
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,774
My brother…

329
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,818
is the Crown Prince.

330
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,573
And His Royal Highness
is fighting for his life as we speak.

331
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,043
What goes around comes around.

332
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,796
What did you just say?

333
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,178
Cause and effect, I mean.

334
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,015
As everything happens for a reason,

335
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,604
I humbly suggest that something went wrong
during the treatment.

336
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,649
The Crown Prince collapsed
after coughing up blood clots.

337
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,776
If you did not tamper with the medicine,

338
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,570
explain what may have gone wrong.

339
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,655
Your Highness.

340
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,157
I may be a lowly wanderer,

341
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,618
but I still have my pride as a physician.

342
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,622
Moreover, if those
were the symptoms that appeared,

343
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,792
I ask you to sheathe your sword now.

344
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,877
Why is that?

345
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,921
Please be reasonable.

346
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,548
You are the one who showed up
out of nowhere one day

347
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,218
and asked me, a total stranger,
for a favor.

348
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:57,764
And all I did was prescribe medicine
that breaks up blood clots.

349
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,558
I have never even laid a finger
on the Crown Prince

350
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,227
or performed acupuncture on him.

351
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,853
Rather, I prescribed

352
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,357
that he should stop receiving acupuncture.

353
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,999
What is the name of the physician
in charge of the Crown Prince?

354
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,542
That does not concern you.

355
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,711
Of course not.

356
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,005
If you know how to save the Crown Prince,

357
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,049
tell me.

358
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,808
It is time to mobilize my people
whom I planted throughout the palace.

359
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,366
Those who are on the bottom rung

360
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,453
and can access the most hidden corners
of the palace will be mobilized first.

361
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,675
Stay next to the Crown Prince
at all times.

362
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,846
No one can be left alone
with the Crown Prince.

363
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,811
You are distracting me. Come back
when I am finished with acupuncture.

364
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,604
No, sire.

365
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,607
Starting today, I will remain here
even when you perform acupuncture.

366
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,112
Especially Royal Physician Cho.
Observe him carefully.

367
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,547
The vomiting of blood has stopped,

368
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,718
yet he remains unconscious.

369
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,804
The more serious problem is

370
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,224
the moves that the Chief State Councilor
and the Queen Dowager are taking.

371
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,060
If they have joined hands,

372
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,064
there would be only one reason.

373
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,410
We shall begin to discuss the deposition
of the Crown Prince publicly.

374
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,912
If you start the discussion,

375
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,790
we will take care of the taekhyeon.

376
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,584
TAEKHYEON: SELECTION OF
A WISE AND WORTHY SUCCESSOR

377
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,919
After the ill Crown Prince is deposed,

378
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,838
who will take over his position?

379
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,343
The Queen Dowager
seems to be more interested in that.

380
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,012
Do not worry.

381
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,141
I do not intend to force
Prince Uiseong into that position.

382
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,768
It is the taekhyeon.

383
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,900
Would it not also be in the interest
of Her Royal Highness

384
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,986
to fairly select a wise Crown Prince?

385
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,154
Shall we?

386
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:48,990
Then…

387
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,202
what will you give me in return?

388
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,205
Whoever becomes the Crown Prince,

389
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,793
the Crown Princess will be your daughter.

390
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,993
Father must be home.

391
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,162
Father!

392
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,415
Father!

393
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,918
Father!

394
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,296
Father, when did you come home?

395
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,217
How many times have I told you?

396
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,510
Lower your voice

397
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,929
-and speak politely.
-You should stop, my lord.

398
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,682
I blame you for spoiling her

399
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,434
to the point that she is
still unmarried at her age.

400
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,644
Father.

401
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,105
When I get married

402
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,857
is not quite as important as whom I marry.

403
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,484
Are you saying

404
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,654
you have been looking
for a respectable man?

405
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,531
Someone knowledgeable?

406
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,741
Someone handsome, Mother.

407
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,910
Someone who will give me
good-looking children.

408
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,621
All men are the same.

409
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,374
I hope to at least marry someone
whose appearance I like.

410
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:28,047
Therefore, I plan to bring in a handsome
young man the day after tomorrow.

411
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,632
I approve of that.

412
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,009
My lady.

413
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,521
Did you forget that we decided
to pretend she was gone?

414
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,857
She cannot live long anyway.

415
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,234
We have let her do whatever she wanted,

416
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,319
thinking her days were numbered.

417
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,197
But look how healthy she is
at the age of 20.

418
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,908
I am confident
that she will live to be 60.

419
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,537
We shall be grateful
that she lived to be 20.

420
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,621
I mean,

421
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,417
what is the point of striving to become
the father of the Queen for 20 years?

422
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,753
We have two more daughters.

423
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,505
I do not care if my reputation is damaged,

424
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,549
but I simply feel so sorry.

425
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,760
We put up with her
since we are her parents,

426
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,095
but what did they do wrong
to end up with her?

427
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,723
Whom do you mean?

428
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,892
Whom else?

429
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,852
I mean the future in-laws of Cheong-ha.

430
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,566
Whoever they are,

431
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,610
I feel awful for them.

432
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,574
"When the Crown Prince falters,
the entire kingdom lies in peril."

433
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,454
"For the greater good, we beseech you

434
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,831
to depose the Crown Prince

435
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,334
and send him into exile…"

436
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,674
Feel free to speak your opinions now.

437
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,806
Do you have nothing to say?

438
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,314
Stop hiding behind a piece of paper

439
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,777
and raise your voices.

440
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,865
Your Majesty.

441
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,869
His Royal Highness has remained
unconscious for two weeks already.

442
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,289
He has also been unable to fulfill
his duties as the Crown Prince.

443
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,208
That is correct, Your Majesty.

444
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,127
To have a worthy heir to the throne

445
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,837
has been a cause of all ages.

446
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,589
To depose unworthy heirs has been

447
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,675
the golden rule of the kingdom.

448
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:39,262
Depose the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.

449
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,723
-Depose the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.
-Depose the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.

450
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,519
-Your Majesty--
-No, Your Majesty.

451
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:51,607
His Royal Highness is unwell
but is under treatment.

452
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,193
It is still too early
to discuss his deposition.

453
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,197
Even if something happens
to the Crown Prince,

454
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,532
he has a son

455
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,993
as well as four grown brothers.

456
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,037
Therefore, there is no need to hurry.

457
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,416
No need to hurry? The kingdom
is tottering on its foundations.

458
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,669
We need to take precautionary measures
to stabilize the kingdom.

459
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,755
It has only been a few days
since the Crown Prince collapsed.

460
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,757
How dare you bring up his deposition?

461
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,134
Enough.

462
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,677
That is enough!

463
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,724
I decline your request.

464
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,685
No further discussion is allowed.

465
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,147
What are you doing?

466
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,648
It was not what we agreed to!

467
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,943
How naive of you.

468
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,653
Pardon?

469
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,325
I was trying to make
the opposition of His Majesty clearer.

470
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,285
If I had not interfered,

471
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,497
he may have announced
the next Crown Prince immediately.

472
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,377
So what is your plan then?

473
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,925
The real battle begins now, Minister Yoon.

474
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,094
We shall overthrow His Majesty

475
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,889
in the way that we enthroned him.

476
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,861
Did you think

477
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,865
that His Majesty would accept
the request immediately?

478
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,245
My son

479
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,998
is no longer easily swayed
by the court officials.

480
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:35,795
However, since His Majesty seems
to be blinded by personal feelings,

481
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,966
we shall remind him of our cause.

482
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,010
I understand.

483
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,097
Then I shall get into action as well.

484
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,737
Your Majesty.

485
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,615
Where would you like to go?

486
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,829
Precisely.

487
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,665
Where shall I go?

488
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,834
Pardon?

489
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,588
I need to rest.

490
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,427
Your Majesty.

491
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,513
It may be dangerous
for you to leave your quarters.

492
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,224
Then what do you suggest?

493
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,603
I need to check.

494
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,149
Something suspicious is going on.

495
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,736
When do you intend to leave?

496
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,279
Right now.

497
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,322
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

498
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,490
It is still too bright.

499
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,586
I need to empty a seolgi.

500
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,795
SEOLGI: CHAMBER POT

501
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,130
You may pass.

502
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,051
Few people in the palace

503
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,179
have seen my face clearly.

504
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,223
Most recognize me by my attire.

505
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,730
Seeing that you are drinking
on an empty stomach,

506
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,316
I presume that
you feel upset about something.

507
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,569
Get some rest here today.

508
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,205
The entire palace is talking
about the same thing.

509
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,375
I feel relieved not to have to hear about

510
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,252
politics or the Crown Prince here.

511
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,514
There is a discussion regarding
the deposition of the Crown Prince.

512
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,225
What is your opinion, Prince Bogeom?

513
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,394
Do not.

514
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,771
It is okay. Tell me what you think.

515
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,613
As the poor health of the Crown Prince
may jeopardize the kingdom,

516
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,659
the discussion of his deposition
is deemed reasonable.

517
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,119
Prince Bogeom.

518
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,328
However,

519
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,707
by bringing up the deposition
of the Crown Prince,

520
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,419
the court officials
are seemingly initiating

521
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,087
a power struggle against you, Father.

522
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,928
Who do you think will win?

523
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,558
Regardless of who wins,
I ask you to fight in better ways, Father.

524
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,644
The process should be just as important.

525
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,313
Even if you grant their request,

526
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,400
do not fall for their scheme.

527
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,821
They must aim to fool the tiger

528
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,657
so that it descends the mountains
of its own will.

529
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,837
You seem to have much insight
into worldly affairs, Prince Bogeom.

530
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,592
Your Majesty.

531
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,553
What is the matter?

532
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,846
Your Majesty.

533
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,347
There is a problem.

534
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,768
Your Majesty.

535
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,104
Depose the sickly Crown Prince

536
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,774
and reinforce
the foundation of the kingdom.

537
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,776
-Depose the Crown Prince
-Depose the Crown Prince

538
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,113
-and restore order in the royal court.
-and restore order in the royal court.

539
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,909
We desperately implore you

540
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,078
to heed our loyal advice, Your Majesty.

541
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,957
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

542
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,879
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

543
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,092
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

544
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,430
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

545
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,185
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

546
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,440
My lady.

547
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,317
He will not come until much later.

548
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,069
Why are we already here?

549
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,946
I do not want to miss him.

550
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,576
Do you see that lady?

551
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,913
She looks like a noble lady.

552
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,915
She must be having an affair.

553
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,042
Just look at her eyes.

554
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,837
While her children are at school,
and her husband is at work…

555
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,631
In broad daylight, at that.

556
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,634
How daring of her.

557
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,763
See? She has such a confident look
in her eyes.

558
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,307
I knew it.

559
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,893
She takes the lead
instead of following the man.

560
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,563
But it seems like she is being tailed.

561
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,944
Judging from the look in his eyes,
he does not suspect her

562
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,737
but wants to protect her.

563
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,406
Pardon?

564
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:00,536
I wonder which family she comes from
and who she is.

565
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,247
CLOSED

566
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,533
This is no different from an abduction.

567
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,828
Why did you bring me here?

568
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,749
You told me this last time.

569
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,544
If you were still the Queen,

570
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,465
you would do anything necessary

571
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,385
to protect your children.

572
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,513
even if people may point
their fingers at you.

573
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,102
I never told you to be this rude,

574
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,898
but I prefer this
than to see you kneel in front of me.

575
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,362
Why did you want to see me?

576
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,405
I need to know

577
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,075
what you meant by what you said.

578
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,826
I do not believe

579
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,413
that it was hyeolheogwol
that caused his death.

580
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,290
You do not believe

581
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,668
that Crown Prince Taein
died from his illness.

582
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,754
Is it merely your reluctance
to let go of your dead child?

583
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,089
Or…

584
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,427
is there any evidence
to support your belief?

585
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,728
Speaking about my dead child
is painful enough.

586
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,899
Why do you keep asking
about what happened in the past?

587
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,986
Because

588
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,448
the life of the current Crown Prince…

589
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,701
depends on your answer.

590
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:08,914
By any chance,

591
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,709
did Crown Prince Taein
cough up blood when he collapsed?

592
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,965
Please tell me, Your Highness.

593
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,218
Why should I

594
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,388
give you an answer?

595
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,808
This may be

596
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,811
my last chance

597
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,648
to protect the Crown Prince.

598
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,915
To be honest with you,

599
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,501
I hope

600
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,005
your son will die.

601
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,134
Your Highness.

602
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,595
It is retribution.

603
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,640
The current royal court

604
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:13,103
was established after purging my sons
and is stained with their blood.

605
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,399
The present king
may be praised for his wisdom,

606
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,321
but he is no more
than a wicked usurper of the throne.

607
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,948
What is the matter?

608
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,202
Am I wrong?

609
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,249
If it really is retribution as you say,

610
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,627
I will accept it with humility.

611
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,755
However, if it is not the divine will

612
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,091
but another human intervention,

613
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,095
I shall get to the bottom of it
using all my resources as the Queen.

614
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,181
Once I find out the truth,

615
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,310
I shall kill

616
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,940
those who harmed my son with my own hands.

617
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,111
So…

618
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,865
will you please tell me?

619
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,500
On one condition.

620
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,003
I am not saying this as a failed queen

621
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,882
but as a mother.

622
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,553
What is it?

623
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,973
I will ask you a favor later.

624
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,891
Whatever favor it is,

625
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,769
promise me that you will grant it.

626
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,028
Very well.

627
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,829
Crown Prince Taein

628
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,873
never coughed up blood.

629
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,835
However,

630
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,423
there were inexplicable wounds
on his body.

631
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,927
Do you mean…

632
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,013
The symptoms of the Crown Prince

633
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,141
are different from those of my son.

634
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,438
It is clear

635
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,316
my son was murdered.

636
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,571
I do not know how he was killed,

637
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,366
but I do know who killed him.

638
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,996
The person who killed him

639
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,457
told me…

640
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,961
in person.

641
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,472
You are right.

642
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,099
I killed your son.

643
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,267
But…

644
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,896
do you have evidence?

645
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,499
Who suggested the taekhyeon

646
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,710
back then?

647
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,505
The court officials did.

648
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:31,301
When they act as a group,

649
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,178
the king

650
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,223
is bound to feel cornered.

651
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,856
Your Majesty.

652
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,109
Depose the Crown Prince

653
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,528
and restore order in the royal court.

654
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,740
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

655
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,869
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

656
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,499
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

657
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:06,837
Do you all intend to disobey me?

658
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:13,635
I made it clear that no further discussion
of the deposition was allowed!

659
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,910
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

660
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,832
Have you decided to remain silent?

661
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,087
If you take no action,
they will eventually have their way.

662
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,757
Either go out and accept their request

663
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,092
or reject it decisively.

664
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,635
Break the silence

665
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,596
and make your position clear.

666
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,807
I will not allow
the deposition of the Crown Prince!

667
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,601
I see.

668
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,937
If so, go out and disperse them.

669
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,733
Silence them so that they cannot raise
their voices against you.

670
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:27,042
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

671
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:30,712
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

672
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,632
You will not be able to stop them.

673
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,343
I am

674
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,221
their king.

675
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,100
They made you king.

676
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,270
They can overthrow you anytime

677
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,856
by questioning your legitimacy,

678
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,735
for you are the son of a concubine.

679
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,200
Without their support,

680
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,537
you will never be able to remain

681
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:05,789
on that throne.

682
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:06,957
Do you truly…

683
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,377
intend to fight them like this

684
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,880
to merely protect the Crown Prince?

685
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,300
What if they completely
turn their backs on you?

686
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,386
Is that not what you fear?

687
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,975
Do you believe
the current prosperity of the kingdom

688
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,645
is solely based on your capabilities?

689
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:34,317
If you know what I have gone through
to come this far,

690
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,362
you cannot

691
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,116
let that child sway you like this.

692
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,582
Do you not realize

693
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,252
the ill child is your grandson?

694
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,297
Before you are the father
of the Crown Prince,

695
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,008
do not forget that you are the king!

696
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,801
If you wish to remain on the throne,

697
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,179
do not further upset them.

698
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,264
It is time

699
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,101
you listen to them.

700
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:13,440
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

701
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:19,362
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

702
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:25,744
-Your Majesty.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

703
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:30,248
I have tried my best
to change their minds,

704
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:35,587
but it seems impossible to turn the tide.

705
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,633
I regret to say this,

706
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,929
but the officials are simply too adamant.

707
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:51,603
So I beseech you to make a decision.

708
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,984
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

709
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,906
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

710
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,410
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

711
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,539
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

712
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:15,502
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

713
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,878
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

714
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:20,382
-Depose the Crown Prince.
-Depose the Crown Prince.

715
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,133
No one is being deposed!

716
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,723
Do you all hope the Crown Prince will die?

717
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,018
Right State Councilor.

718
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:33,895
Do you realize

719
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,357
how unreasonable and unfair
this request is?

720
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,862
Minister of Personnel.

721
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,450
Has the Crown Prince
ever committed an injustice?

722
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,706
Minister of War.

723
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:58,503
Has the Crown Prince ever jeopardized
the kingdom by indulging in pleasures?

724
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,674
Tell me what he did so wrong!

725
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,509
If anyone did anything wrong,

726
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,138
all of you and I should be blamed

727
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,474
for failing to protect the Crown Prince.

728
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,270
The Crown Prince did not do
anything wrong!

729
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,732
Your Majesty.

730
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,860
The Crown Prince
is the heir to the throne.

731
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:26,197
The future of the kingdom
as well as the lives of the people

732
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,158
solely rest on his shoulders.

733
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,538
You speak of the future of the kingdom,

734
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,083
but look at what you are doing.

735
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,294
You are no better

736
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,379
than a group of bandits

737
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,049
pressuring His Majesty
into granting you what you want.

738
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,761
Restoring the health
of the ill Crown Prince

739
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,056
is the way to protect
the future of the kingdom.

740
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,224
Your Majesty.

741
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,226
Silence, Chief State Councilor!

742
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,772
I am not finished yet.

743
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,609
As the officials of the kingdom,

744
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,945
you should be trying to help
the Crown Prince recover.

745
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,491
Instead, you all swarmed here
making such a commotion!

746
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,869
Is it to save the Crown Prince

747
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,082
or to kill him?

748
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,213
What is it that you are truly after?

749
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,632
Your Majesty.

750
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,761
You are supposed to be in confinement.

751
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,931
How could you disobey His Majesty
and appear here?

752
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,183
I released her from confinement.

753
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,563
Also,

754
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:45,068
you shall consider
the words of the Queen as mine.

755
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,487
Your Majesty.

756
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,240
-The future of the kingdom--
-Silence!

757
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,411
There will be no further discussion
of the deposition.

758
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,288
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

759
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,208
-We beseech you to reconsider.
-We beseech you to reconsider.

760
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,544
Listen, all officials.

761
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,755
The Crown Prince is still under treatment.

762
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,259
Anyone who discusses his deposition
and schemes to replace him

763
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,761
against my orders

764
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,432
shall be accused of treason.

765
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,397
What are you waiting for? Leave!

766
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,008
Your Majesty!

767
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,681
The Crown Prince…

768
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,480
His Royal Highness awoke for a moment
and asked for you.

769
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,317
I do not think there is much time left.

770
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:12,238
His Royal Highness said
that he needed to speak to you.

771
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,742
That he needed to hear an answer from you.

772
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,286
Mother.

773
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,956
Promise me…

774
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,128
that you will remain strong.

775
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,968
Only then will I be able to die in peace.

776
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,516
I will stay by your side

777
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,727
even as the wind.

778
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,106
Please do protect

779
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,068
my son and brothers.

780
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,246
I cannot make such a promise.

781
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,709
You will recover no matter what.

782
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,090
Please wait just a little longer

783
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,261
so that I can give you my answer.

784
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,014
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Royal Highness!

785
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,558
Your Royal Highness…

786
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,520
No…

787
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,991
Your Royal Highness.

788
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,868
Your Royal Highness.

789
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,426
Mother.

790
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,387
Promise me…

791
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,515
that you will remain strong.

792
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,899
I have something to tell the Crown Prince.

793
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,528
I need to give him an answer.

794
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,551
My baby…

795
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:44,724
I…

796
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,352
promise.

797
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,859
Do not wander around worrying about me…

798
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,241
and rest in peace.

799
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,803
I promise

800
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,098
that I will remain strong.

801
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,768
I will protect

802
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,313
your children

803
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,192
as well as mine.

804
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,980
Return to us, Your Royal Highness!

805
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,316
Return to us, Your Royal Highness!

806
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,654
Brother!

807
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,906
When will you be back?

808
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,616
I do not know.

809
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,911
I will be back as soon as I can.

810
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,540
Next time, I will take you to the market.

811
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,724
Brother.

812
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,893
Hurry back.

813
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:59,442
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

814
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:27,553
Who would dare to take
the life of the Crown Prince?

815
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,640
How can you be sure
that it was not poisoned?

816
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,601
Do you think Her Majesty was behind it?

817
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:37,480
The branch that stemmed out first
should reach the highest, should it not?

818
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:41,400
In order to proceed with the taekhyeon,
we must come together.

819
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,236
I want you to support Prince Bogeom.

820
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,822
Not only will you
dine like the Crown Prince,

821
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,324
but you will
also receive an education like one.

822
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:52,119
We can no longer hide that we used
medicine brought from the outside.

823
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:57,208
