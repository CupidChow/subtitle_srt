1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,916
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,091
By any chance,

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,927
have you seen this man?

5
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,929
I am not sure.

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,017
But he does look familiar.

7
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,937
SEO HAM-DEOK

8
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,856
Is this not Monk Haeham?

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,442
It is.

10
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,819
Monk Haeham?

11
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,784
"A monk descends the mountain
and enters the market."

12
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,996
"His chanting is no longer heard,
but he is heard counting coins."

13
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,627
A monk who got a taste of money?

14
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,381
Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

15
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,719
I will do anything

16
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,350
to prevent any prince born of the Queen

17
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,478
from becoming the Crown Prince.

18
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,278
The Chief State Councilor…

19
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,863
KILL AT ALL COSTS

20
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,742
…and Mother both attempted
to harm Grand Prince Seongnam?

21
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,828
Is it really true?

22
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,745
Yes.

23
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,622
It is.

24
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,376
I talked to Her Royal Highness
before I came here.

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,503
If it is true,

26
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,215
I will order an investigation
and hold them responsible immediately.

27
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,341
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,051
As his mother,

29
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,138
I also wish to punish them immediately.

30
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,391
However, if this becomes public,

31
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,102
I am worried it will affect the contest.

32
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,355
If they did this during a contest
to select the Crown Prince,

33
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,941
they are clearly defying my authority.

34
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,069
Yes, it is utterly unacceptable.

35
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,697
We lost our child before this contest.

36
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,782
And

37
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,120
it almost caused us to lose another child.

38
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,581
But we are up against

39
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,875
the Chief State Councilor
and the Queen Dowager.

40
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,210
Are you

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,714
willing to punish your mother?

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,053
I only told you

43
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,391
because I reckoned
you should know the truth.

44
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,102
If this happens again,

45
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,064
I will not merely sit back.

46
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,233
If it does,

47
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,153
whoever they are,

48
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,489
I will punish those who are responsible.

49
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:28,958
Announce my arrival.

50
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,044
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,463
Her Royal Highness is unable to see you

52
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,965
because she is feeling unwell.

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,511
It will not take long. Open the doors.

54
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,776
Why…

55
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,698
Why on earth did you do that?

56
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,451
It is your grandchild,

57
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,536
of all people.

58
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,249
Are you willing to do anything

59
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,878
to make your favored prince
the Crown Prince?

60
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,468
Answer me.

61
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,779
Your Majesty.

62
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,073
With all due respect,

63
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,617
Her Royal Highness had a cuckoo pint

64
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,786
and barely escaped dire harm.

65
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,038
That is enough.

66
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,748
A cuckoo pint?

67
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,375
Is that not a poisonous plant?

68
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,086
Her Majesty the Queen

69
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,046
offered it to her.

70
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,257
She did?

71
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,551
Your Majesty.

72
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,597
Do you truly believe

73
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,061
I committed something so heinous?

74
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,691
How could you suspect your mother

75
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,778
only based on the words of the Queen?

76
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,873
Very well.

77
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,751
I admit

78
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,213
I was never fond of Grand Prince Seongnam.

79
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,468
You are also…

80
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,014
aware of his origins,

81
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,726
are you not?

82
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,148
Even so,

83
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:05,198
how could you accuse me
of attempting to kill my grandchild?

84
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,624
Your Royal Highness!

85
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,146
The worst is over,

86
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,398
but her condition is still critical.

87
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,069
Keep a close eye on her

88
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,156
until she regains her strength.

89
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,676
My Queen.

90
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,638
Is it true that you offered a cuckoo pint

91
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,682
to Mother?

92
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,852
Yes.

93
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,565
I did offer it to her.

94
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,524
However,

95
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,235
it was merely a warning.

96
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,237
No matter how upset you were,

97
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,074
you should not have done that.

98
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,536
You only provided her with a way out.

99
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,460
Mother attempted to kill her grandchild,

100
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,465
while you attempted
to kill your mother-in-law.

101
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,594
To whom…

102
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,681
will I be able to tell this?

103
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,379
You may rise now, Your Royal Highness.

104
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,144
You are still no match for me.

105
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,399
I did not…

106
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,906
expect you to stoop so low.

107
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,079
-You must have been very shocked.
-Yes.

108
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,957
I almost ordered
the Directorate of the State Funeral

109
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,543
to prepare for your funeral.

110
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,717
It would have been a waste

111
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,304
to use the cuckoo pint that you offered
as a mere decoration.

112
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,767
I thought I should repay your kindness.

113
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,936
If I had known,

114
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,771
I would have

115
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,275
carefully decocted it myself.

116
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,279
Had you actually come close to death,

117
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:36,242
you would not have had
to put on that lousy act like a clown.

118
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,746
-Your Majesty.
-Your dangui,

119
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:46,627
the ceremonial dress,
still suits you better than a shroud.

120
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,175
I suggest you drop the act and rise now.

121
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,595
I would

122
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,181
like you to remain healthy

123
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,852
and watch my son become the Crown Prince.

124
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,145
I should.

125
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,690
However, there is something
you should know.

126
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,151
I decide who becomes the Crown Prince.

127
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,614
So wait and see whom I choose.

128
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,367
Do not think

129
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,287
my hands and feet are tied

130
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,206
because of what happened
to Grand Prince Seongnam.

131
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,727
How can she be so confident?

132
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,438
There must be something going on.

133
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,816
Consort Tae has been
frequenting her quarters lately.

134
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:55,571
Could it be that the Queen Dowager
has Prince Bogeom in mind?

135
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,660
One would assume so,
but nothing is certain yet.

136
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,206
She may have changed horses
and be supporting Prince Bogeom now

137
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,501
or she may be merely using him
to crown Prince Uiseong.

138
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,920
Or perhaps…

139
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,715
she intends to keep both horses.

140
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,427
We must find out her true intention.

141
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,846
Is there a way?

142
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,898
Your Majesty.

143
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,442
Why did you send for me?

144
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,361
Did you succeed in delivering

145
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,823
the bamboo case to Prince Bogeom?

146
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,909
A bamboo case?

147
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,664
What information would I have
to deliver to him in a bamboo case?

148
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,627
The information was from Minister Yoon
and Deputy Minister Bae, was it not?

149
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,424
You are a pure person.

150
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,676
It is written all over your face.

151
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,720
It is all right.

152
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,766
I will not inform His Majesty or anything.

153
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:12,273
Besides, the Queen Dowager
is especially fond of Prince Bogeom.

154
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,026
I do not believe that she favors him
over the other princes.

155
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,114
However, she did mention
he had the potential

156
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,784
to become a king as wise as His Majesty
with proper education.

157
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,912
Did she go so far as to say that?

158
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,956
Yes, she did.

159
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,962
Consort Tae.

160
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:36,964
Do you think

161
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,260
Prince Bogeom can really
become the Crown Prince?

162
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,556
You must be well aware

163
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,102
that to me, this contest means far more

164
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,646
than the selection of the Crown Prince.

165
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,733
Of course, I am.

166
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,153
Even if Prince Bogeom
becomes the Crown Prince,

167
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,198
I will make sure you maintain
your position as the Queen.

168
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,453
For me to save you the trouble,

169
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,998
one of the Grand Princes
must become the Crown Prince.

170
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,423
Did you hear the Queen Dowager is unwell?

171
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,425
Pardon?

172
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,885
You did not know?

173
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,598
Her Royal Highness is unwell
and bedridden at the moment.

174
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,642
Oh, my.

175
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,894
She is? What is the problem?

176
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,479
I am not sure.

177
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,690
Maybe you should go and ask her yourself.

178
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,527
If you do,

179
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,072
she will certainly be very happy.

180
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,199
I will.

181
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,795
Why did you send Consort Tae
to Her Royal Highness?

182
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,142
You pay a commission
of a fifth of the price?

183
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,230
Why do you pay Park Gyeong-u a commission
to sell your ocean quahogs?

184
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,233
Why else? That is the law
here on Manwol Island.

185
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,651
The law?

186
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,528
Who created such a law?

187
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,946
Who else?

188
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,739
Master Hyomyeong did.

189
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,951
Do you think he is the King or something?

190
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,494
Even if he sells your products for you,

191
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,038
a commission of a fifth of the price
is simply too high.

192
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,791
-Let us go.
-Yes, we should.

193
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,501
Good work.

194
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,800
Did you follow me?

195
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,637
I am on my way
to look around the trading port.

196
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,312
Here we go. Who wants to buy it?

197
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,147
Five nyang nine jeon.

198
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,899
Does anyone want it?

199
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,026
We are now at five nyang seven jeon.

200
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,320
Hurry up and make up your mind!

201
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,322
Then how about this?

202
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,115
We go down to five nyang two jeon.

203
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,868
Come on. Does anyone want it?

204
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,328
Four nyang five jeon.

205
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,372
Who wants it?

206
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,374
Four nyang, anyone?

207
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,044
The price was over five nyang
a moment ago.

208
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,962
Why does the price keep dropping?

209
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,005
Three nyang one jeon.

210
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,884
The price keeps falling.
When are you selling them?

211
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,930
I am hungry. I should go and eat.

212
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,891
You want to eat in this situation?

213
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,810
What do you intend to do
with all those ocean quahogs?

214
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,437
Wait until the end.

215
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,528
Did you find out
who intercepted the subleader?

216
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,074
I am asking around everywhere,
but there is no progress yet.

217
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:54,244
What if that bandit says something
he should not?

218
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,665
My lord, someone is here to see you.

219
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,420
What brings you to my humble abode

220
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,298
when you must be occupied
with your duties?

221
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,345
I have been keeping
a close eye on you recently.

222
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:18,102
Then it came to my attention
that you are searching

223
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,146
the entire capital for someone.

224
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,858
I am not sure what you are talking about.

225
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,240
I am talking about the bandits you sent
to the princes headed for Manwol Island.

226
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,245
Bandits? That is absurd.

227
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,874
Why would I have anything
to do with something so atrocious?

228
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,085
Is that right?

229
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,632
Bring him.

230
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,186
It was him.

231
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,981
I am certain he was the one
who gave an order to my leader.

232
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,203
Once the investigation begins,

233
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,081
you will be held responsible

234
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,083
for attempting to murder
Grand Prince Seongnam.

235
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,132
Prince Uiseong is ahead in the contest.

236
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,801
-Why would I do something so reckless?
-Right.

237
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,054
It was not you.

238
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,558
All you tried to do
was get in his way for a short while

239
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,186
to stall for time.

240
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:48,150
Then who do you think ordered
the murder of Grand Prince Seongnam

241
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,403
and even tried to frame you for it?

242
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,662
As you seem lost,
I will tell you who it was.

243
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,170
It was the Queen Dowager.

244
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,926
I wish

245
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,637
I could rip everyone involved to pieces.

246
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,599
But as the contest to select
the Crown Prince is still underway,

247
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,309
I will stop here for now.

248
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,697
By the way,

249
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,033
why do you think

250
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,662
the Queen Dowager
tried to frame you for it?

251
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:47,042
On top of that, she has been
summoning Consort Tae often lately.

252
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,418
Could it be

253
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,714
that she wishes to make Prince Bogeom
the Crown Prince?

254
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,595
At this rate,

255
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,725
I am afraid there will come a time
for you and I to work together.

256
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,410
Please wait inside.

257
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,247
Monk Haeham will not be back
until this evening.

258
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,344
Come out here, you bastard!

259
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,056
How dare you fool around
with a lady asking for a talisman?

260
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,641
Tell me!

261
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,476
Where is my wife?

262
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,480
How is it my fault
that you failed to satisfy your wife?

263
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,732
Why you little…

264
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,200
Somebody please get him!

265
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,245
That bastard lured a lady
into having her fortune told

266
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,626
only to fool around with her.

267
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,677
You should have kept
a closer eye on your wife.

268
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,848
Show up in front of me again,
and I will slit your throat.

269
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,233
What an interesting turn of events.

270
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,400
Should I follow him?

271
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,568
No.

272
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,112
-Wait a moment and follow that man.
-Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,826
WOLINSEOKBO: ONE OF THE RELIGIOUS TEXTS
IN BUDDHISM

274
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,252
Military strategies
hidden in a Buddhist text?

275
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,257
Why is there a ground plan
of the Eastern Palaces here?

276
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,394
You should lie in bed a little longer.

277
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,899
No, I feel fine now.

278
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,442
My goodness.

279
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,988
I wanted to visit you
as soon as I heard you were unwell,

280
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:49,076
but I wanted to make the porridge myself,
so I only came now.

281
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,745
Please eat even just a little
while it is warm.

282
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,458
I see you are not only a good mother

283
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,752
but also a devoted daughter-in-law.

284
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,879
You certainly have

285
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,091
what it takes to be a queen.

286
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,386
A queen?

287
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,605
Announce my arrival.

288
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:23,401
Her Royal Highness
is with Consort Tae right now.

289
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,945
Is that so?

290
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,155
Let her know we will come back.

291
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,365
No.

292
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,992
We will wait.

293
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,835
Oh, my.

294
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,382
Brother.

295
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,635
I think this journey made me a real man.

296
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,558
I will never forget

297
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,561
the time I spent with you.

298
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,982
GRAND PRINCE ILYEONG

299
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:07,821
I cannot believe so many princes
have dropped out so early in the contest.

300
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,032
Do not be so harsh.

301
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,536
I am already devastated
that Prince Hodong failed.

302
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,416
There are only two left on Manwol Island
and two on Mount Gyeryong now.

303
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,710
On what grounds do you say that?

304
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,920
There are six identification plaques left.

305
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,591
I heard Prince Simso
has not reached Mount Gyeryong yet.

306
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,759
Did you not know that?

307
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,724
We will reach Hanseong soon,
so hang in there.

308
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,448
Are you giving it to me?

309
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,493
Yes. I have been holding it dear,

310
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,246
but I think it will suit you very well.

311
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,666
Oh, my.

312
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,090
This is absolutely lovely!

313
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,885
With the support you are offering us,

314
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,179
now it depends
on how well Prince Bogeom does.

315
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,725
It does not
solely depend on Prince Bogeom.

316
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:23,104
One cannot become the Crown Prince
without an elaborate plan

317
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,025
and the meticulous execution of it.

318
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:27,984
Sometimes,

319
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,822
it all comes down
to how much information his mother has.

320
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,992
Information?

321
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,118
Yes.

322
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,287
Speaking of which,

323
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,832
would you like to hear
an important piece of information?

324
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,851
Oh, my. I did not know
you were still here.

325
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,363
I brought over some porridge
as the Queen Dowager is unwell.

326
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,455
What makes you sneer like that?

327
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,501
Seeing you carrying the table

328
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,421
reminds me of how you used to

329
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,215
scurry around the palace as a court maid.

330
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,220
Instead of indulging
in such a useless thought,

331
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,264
you should have brought something.

332
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,101
It is all about give and take, is it not?

333
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,728
If you will excuse me.

334
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,860
I know how busy the two of you are.

335
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,072
Why did you wait so long
to see this old woman?

336
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,325
You could have come back another time.

337
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,785
For there may be no other time.

338
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:08,877
It has been a while
since I last enjoyed your tea,

339
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,462
so I waited.

340
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,428
The water has already become cold.

341
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,181
It is too late to brew tea.

342
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:25,185
They say there is a time for everything.

343
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:29,314
However, if there are still
tea leaves left in the teapot,

344
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,818
it is not too late to warm up
the teacups again, is it?

345
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,117
Bring hot water and new teacups.

346
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,202
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

347
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,796
I must ask you something.

348
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,258
I reckon this contest will determine
not only the next Crown Prince

349
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,552
but also the next Queen.

350
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,640
Whom do you have in mind?

351
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,559
I am not sure.

352
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,146
But one thing is for certain.

353
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,776
The Queen must be replaced.

354
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,528
Preferably,

355
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,823
replaced by you.

356
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,536
For that to happen, Prince Uiseong
will have to become the Crown Prince.

357
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,671
Rumor has it

358
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:39,300
that you are supporting Prince Bogeom.

359
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,722
Should I be concerned?

360
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,517
What is wrong with that?

361
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,937
Who is to say Prince Bogeom
cannot become the Crown Prince?

362
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,443
Whoever becomes the Crown Prince,

363
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,821
must be decided by me.

364
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,323
So I advise you

365
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:07,287
to stop thinking for yourself
and do as I say.

366
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,165
Then you will surely be rewarded.

367
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,626
Do as you say?

368
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,754
Your Royal Highness.

369
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:20,091
I, the Chief State Councilor,
am not under your command.

370
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:24,012
Also, the Crown Prince
will be decided by the court officials

371
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,806
along with His Majesty.

372
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:32,395
Have you forgotten
who enthroned His Majesty?

373
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:40,236
Is that why you tried to murder
Grand Prince Seongnam and frame me for it?

374
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,949
If you did not have Prince Bogeom in mind,
why in the world did you do that?

375
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,828
To have your cake and eat it too?

376
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,374
I see the Queen
has been running her mouth.

377
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,375
Your Royal Highness.

378
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,381
It is disgraceful
to be greedy at an old age.

379
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,729
Seeing that you halted the tea ceremony,

380
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,440
I think we should take our leave.

381
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,514
Who do you think

382
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,600
should become the Crown Prince,
Minister Yoon?

383
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,690
A prince who deeply cares
about the people.

384
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,485
In that case,
who do you think is such a prince?

385
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:08,658
You know better than anyone
that I serve the Queen Dowager.

386
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:12,954
So I am sure you know none of
the Grand Princes would be my answer.

387
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,210
I reckon many people
have been approaching you recently.

388
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,754
At a time like this,

389
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,924
it is important to exercise prudence.

390
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,344
Your Majesty.

391
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,723
What is it that you want to say?

392
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,144
You are the only relative of Queen Yoon

393
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,938
who survived after she was demoted.

394
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,567
So you must understand better than anyone

395
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:48,406
that it is more important to survive
than to remain faithful.

396
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:55,079
Stay neutral between the Queen Dowager
and Chief State Councilor from now on,

397
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,583
and you will be given a chance

398
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,336
when one of the Grand Princes
becomes the Crown Prince.

399
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,303
Think about it carefully.

400
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,557
You never know what can happen.

401
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,477
Master!

402
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,436
Master!

403
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,355
The ocean quahogs sold out.

404
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,690
Very well. How much were you paid?

405
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,109
I was paid seven nyang per gwan.

406
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,028
GWAN: UNIT TO MEASURE WEIGHT,
ONE GWAN EQUALS 3.75KG

407
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,031
Were you really paid that much?

408
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,449
Yes.

409
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,534
Are you curious?

410
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,956
Would you like to guess what happened?

411
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,249
To sell at a high price,

412
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,919
he must have waited
for the price to rise back up.

413
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:47,924
He was fortunate today,
but it seems to be a rather risky method.

414
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,926
It was not luck but a prediction.

415
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,845
Most ocean quahogs on the market today

416
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,139
were of low quality,

417
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,101
while the ones from Manwol Island
were of the highest quality.

418
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,312
As those who want high-quality ones
would be willing to pay extra,

419
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,483
the price was bound to rise
as time went by.

420
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,236
That is correct.

421
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,697
You win this time.

422
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,908
You should do better.

423
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,828
-Let me carry this.
-Very well.

424
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,050
By any chance,
have you been looking for me?

425
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,177
No. I am looking
for a box of counting sticks.

426
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,558
A box of counting sticks?

427
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,645
Carry them carefully.

428
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,813
-Yes, Master.
-Yes, Master.

429
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,691
Does it not seem like all the money
he made from selling ocean quahogs

430
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,569
and the store are going into his pocket?

431
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,946
Have some faith.

432
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,699
-This is called reasonable doubt.
-Master!

433
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,492
Thank you, Master.

434
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,452
Good work.

435
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,455
See? He is still pretending to be blind.

436
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,124
As an exclusive seller
of their ocean quahogs,

437
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,461
he demands a commission of a fifth
of the price, which is worse than usury.

438
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,337
Yet the islanders feel indebted to him.

439
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,341
I wonder if he shares the profits
with the islanders fairly.

440
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,595
We are not here to investigate him.

441
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,974
Our mission is to bring him to the palace.

442
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,562
Goodness.

443
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,689
Is everyone on board?

444
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,195
One person is missing.

445
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,491
We should depart regardless.

446
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,950
We are departing.

447
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,202
Wait!

448
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,127
-Were you waiting for me?
-No.

449
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,019
Goodness, my lady.

450
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,856
If it were not for the inspector,
you would have missed the ferry.

451
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,526
So you did wait for me.

452
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,277
I did not.

453
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,198
Here.

454
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,122
Were you late because you were buying
this box of counting sticks?

455
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,292
I came to Manwol Island unexpectedly,
so I ran out of money.

456
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,671
It took a while
to sell my hair ribbon to buy this.

457
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,799
I appreciate it.

458
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,054
And I should thank you for waiting for me.

459
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,611
Are you giving me
this box of counting sticks?

460
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,446
Yes.

461
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,198
You should never lose it again.

462
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,871
When I grow up, I will teach
sanhak at the village school.

463
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,247
SANHAK: THE STUDY OF ARITHMETIC

464
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,707
It sounds absurd, does it not?

465
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,126
It is just wishful thinking.

466
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,920
Hold on to that thought.

467
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:17,508
One's dream never dies
unless one runs away.

468
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,401
Then he is not of royal blood?

469
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,195
It says so here.

470
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,571
How reprehensible.

471
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,031
My goodness.

472
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,576
-Is it really true?
-It is absolutely dreadful.

473
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,911
Oh, my.

474
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,329
How could this happen?

475
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,789
-This is unbelievable.
-Where is this kingdom going?

476
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,374
He is not his real son?

477
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,545
What made you want to use Consort Tae?

478
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,424
She is a simple person.

479
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,677
Once she becomes consumed with ambition,

480
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,306
she will push forward single-mindedly.

481
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,769
Chadosalin.

482
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,687
CHADOSALIN:  TO KILL A PERSON
WITH A BORROWED KNIFE

483
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,858
I will not stain my hands
with blood this time.

484
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,987
I am a prince, I swear.

485
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,572
I am Prince Simso.

486
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:26,285
If you really are a prince,
show me your identification plaque.

487
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,956
His Majesty took it.
What can I do to make you believe me?

488
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,708
I will believe you
once you show me the proof!

489
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,798
To the east of Buyongji in the
Eastern Palaces is Yeonghwadang.

490
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,634
To the south is Sajeonggibigak
and to the north is Eosumun.

491
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,438
Why are you here?

492
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,818
I am starving,

493
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,444
Mother.

494
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,739
I have not had any proper meals.

495
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:08,077
And I was robbed of all my money
and my horse tally.

496
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,162
Go back this instant.

497
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,623
Go back and partake in the contest.

498
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,459
I do not think

499
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,170
I can in this state.

500
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,631
Please let me in.

501
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,468
I am feeling terribly unwell, Mother.

502
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,515
When they find out
you really are a prince,

503
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,892
you will be eliminated immediately.

504
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,227
Mother…

505
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,730
You should not have returned to the palace

506
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:40,359
even if your body had shattered to pieces
and you stopped breathing.

507
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,957
Hurry back to where you should be.

508
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,507
I spoke to the boy out of sympathy,

509
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,302
but how could you mistake
someone like him for Prince Simso?

510
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,055
My apologies, Your Grace.

511
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,639
I will let it slide this time,

512
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,186
so take that beggar away immediately.

513
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,782
Never come near the palace again.

514
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,617
Let us go.

515
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,184
Pour me one.

516
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,605
Goodness, this is nice.

517
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,857
Try this.

518
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,449
My lord, this girl works in the kitchen.

519
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,868
She is a courtesan
if she works at a courtesan house.

520
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,454
Pour me one.

521
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,082
My lord, please stop.

522
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,834
What are you waiting for?

523
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,670
I will pour you one, my lord.

524
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,257
So please let go of her.

525
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:32,346
Will the proud Cho-wol
really pour me a drink?

526
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,642
Cho-wol, stay out of it.

527
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,186
Come on. Do not be like that, madam.

528
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,606
Go ahead and pour me one.

529
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,859
Please let the girl go first.

530
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,152
You may go.

531
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,960
-Get your hand off.
-Who are you, you bastard?

532
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,588
-You are better off not knowing.
-Why you little…

533
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,508
Do you know who I am?

534
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,093
The Minister of Personnel is my uncle!

535
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,596
Is this about family?

536
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,098
My father is the King, you imbecile.

537
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,829
Please leave.

538
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,499
It will be bad if your mother finds out.

539
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:42,958
Right.

540
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,420
She will not let it slide
if she finds out I am here.

541
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,882
I am actually about to
go through something extremely important.

542
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,302
But I still came to you.

543
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,018
I did not know you were so nimble.

544
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:06,607
Right? I moved faster than I spoke
for the first time in my life.

545
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,532
You must leave now.

546
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,747
No. I will not leave
before you give me your answer.

547
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,917
Promise me that you will not
become a courtesan.

548
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:30,297
Just the thought of you being
with another man makes my blood boil.

549
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,552
Do you like me?

550
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,262
Of course, I do.

551
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,848
As a woman, I mean.

552
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,770
I have never thought about it, but…

553
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,401
I think I do.

554
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,822
I mean, I do.

555
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,115
I like you as a woman.

556
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,916
-I do not trust men.
-What are you talking about?

557
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,088
After I came all the way here,
do you still not understand how I feel?

558
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,220
You always make me smile.

559
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,728
By the way,

560
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,355
have you always been this beautiful?

561
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,232
Yes.

562
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,905
I missed you.

563
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,207
Did you just say
you wish to spend the night here?

564
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,210
Yes, please let me stay here.

565
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,010
She is your guest,
so you take care of her.

566
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:58,927
Pardon?

567
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:10,981
My goodness.

568
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,527
What is it now?

569
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,116
An unmarried man and woman
should not share the same room.

570
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,284
What…

571
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,994
Will you blow out the candle?

572
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,996
I must sleep before the twenty-first hour.

573
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,539
Wait…

574
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,334
Wash your blankets more often.
You should know better.

575
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,543
What…

576
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,545
What are you…

577
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:44,181
Leave my house
on the third day before the cockcrow!

578
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,468
No one is taking away your food.
Slow down.

579
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,975
Why are you clasping onto
that norigae so tightly?

580
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,439
This ornament…

581
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,983
is the first gift

582
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,820
my mother has ever given to me.

583
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,532
She said I should not have

584
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,742
returned to the palace
even if my body shattered to pieces

585
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,619
and I stopped breathing.

586
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,889
What do you think you are doing?

587
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,474
He is my child.

588
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,267
So stay out of it, Your Majesty.

589
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,354
You know it is my responsibility
to watch over all of the princes.

590
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,190
Why do you not be honest?

591
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,484
Admit you are glad and relieved

592
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,194
that Prince Simso dropped out.

593
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,029
Yes, I am relieved.

594
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,990
Imagine he foolishly persisted
despite his poor health.

595
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:28,785
What do you think
would have happened to him?

596
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,537
Stop pretending to be generous!

597
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,082
If he was your son,
would you have brought him here?

598
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,125
I would

599
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,545
at least not have sent him away

600
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,298
after seeing how debilitated he was.

601
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,968
He is my everything.

602
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,722
And my world crumbled around me today!

603
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,724
Escort Consort Ko to her quarters.

604
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,363
You are a disgrace to me and my family.

605
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,533
It would have been better if you had died.

606
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,869
I regret…

607
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,539
giving birth to you.

608
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,501
You useless imbecile!

609
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,418
What is this?

610
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,319
What brings you here
this early in the morning?

611
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,323
I am here to reveal the ugly truth
behind Grand Prince Gyeseong.

612
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:03,268
Grand Prince Gyeseong
is a woman in the shell of a man.

613
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:08,440
He has been putting on female clothes
and makeup in a secret chamber,

614
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,776
bringing disgrace to the royal court.

615
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,031
But the Queen has been covering it up.

616
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,952
And the Queen Dowager knows all about it.

617
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,331
Her Royal Highness knows about it?

618
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:28,877
Yes.

619
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:34,299
A weakness of a Grand Prince
is a weakness of his mother, the Queen.

620
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:39,387
It will prove useful
in your becoming the Queen.

621
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,431
Even if something goes wrong,

622
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,267
the Queen Dowager will have your back.

623
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:55,654
I will give this to you
once you grant me a favor.

624
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,323
What is it you want?

625
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,537
I wish to see the Queen

626
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,583
weep tears of blood.

627
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,301
Has Prince Simso been served breakfast?

628
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,636
Yes, Your Majesty.

629
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,515
But seeing that the table has not
been returned, he must still be in bed.

630
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,269
He was in the cold when he was
already tired from his journey.

631
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,938
He must be fatigued.

632
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,690
We should go back, Your Majesty.

633
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:35,902
No.

634
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,155
I need to see him for myself.
Open the doors.

635
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,665
-No!
-Your Highness…

636
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,458
-Prince Simso!
-No!

637
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,127
-No!
-Prince Simso!

638
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,629
-Prince Simso!
-Send for help!

639
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,090
No, Prince Simso!

640
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,427
We need a physician!

641
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,429
We need a physician! This is an emergency!

642
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,681
We need a physician!

643
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,725
Hurry.

644
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,646
-Lay him down here.
-His pulse is gone. Hurry.

645
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,481
-No time to lose.
-Nurse Kim, bring water.

646
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,077
Where is everyone?

647
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,002
Where is Prince Simso?

648
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,049
I am asking where Prince Simso is.

649
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,139
Your Majesty.
Fortunately, his pulse returned.

650
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,558
You do not have to worry.

651
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,863
Listen, everyone.

652
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,116
If rumors about this spread in the palace,

653
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,870
all of you will receive punishment.

654
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,581
Prince Simso received treatment

655
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,709
for the fatigue from his journey.

656
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:19,214
He will stay in my quarters
for the time being, so you may leave now.

657
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,993
I will send Court Lady Shin

658
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,954
when he wakes up.

659
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,581
You may go back.

660
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,917
I…

661
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,963
I am his mother.

662
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,215
I will…

663
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,094
stay by his side.

664
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,265
If he finds out
you are aware of what he did today,

665
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,685
he will not be able to bear it.

666
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,859
You are still full of yourself.

667
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,778
Think as you wish.

668
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,781
But I hope you can continue

669
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,284
to be a mother who scolds their child

670
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,162
when they do something wrong.

671
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,541
I also hope Prince Simso
will be able to face you

672
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,045
even after being scolded by you.

673
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,302
Do you know
what he was clasping onto until the end?

674
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,324
I heard you gave it to him.

675
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,249
Seeing that you ran here
without even wearing your shoes,

676
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,337
you must have been worried about him.

677
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,634
Do not be too hard on yourself.

678
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,012
You did make a grave mistake,

679
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,851
but you already received
the heaviest punishment.

680
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,015
You are awake.

681
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,190
Did you sleep well?

682
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,652
Prince Simso.

683
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,906
Yes, Your Majesty.

684
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,366
Have you ever had a drink?

685
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,620
Pardon?

686
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,787
A drink?

687
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,626
No, I have never.

688
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,670
Then let me teach you.

689
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,802
Would you like to see
something interesting?

690
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,658
What is this?

691
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,244
It is called a gyeyeongbae.

692
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,874
When the cup is less than
seven-tenths full,

693
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,293
it holds the liquid perfectly.

694
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,547
But when it is filled beyond that,

695
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,466
it drains all the liquid

696
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,052
until it becomes empty.

697
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,642
No one is perfect.

698
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,769
Maybe everyone

699
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:28,231
has holes like this gyeyeongbae.

700
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,613
Even I, the Queen, am full of those holes.

701
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,910
But as long as you are content,

702
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:45,373
you can say you are living a good life
even if it is not full.

703
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,543
However,

704
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:53,923
I am ashamed
that I always fail to overcome my limits.

705
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,844
Did you also want to become
the Crown Prince?

706
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,929
No.

707
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,683
Just the thought of becoming one
gives me a headache.

708
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,269
In that case,

709
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,480
you did not fail
to become the Crown Prince

710
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,691
but chose not to.

711
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,818
So why should you be ashamed?

712
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,447
To force yourself to do something
you do not want. That is shameful.

713
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,827
People fear their drink
spilling out of a gyeyeongbae,

714
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,120
but if you ask me,

715
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,542
I like that it has these holes.

716
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,128
It knows when to empty itself

717
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,506
and drains whatever is unnecessary.

718
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,347
Likewise, when you want to do something,
you should give it a try.

719
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,058
When you are unhappy, you should resist.

720
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,727
And be stubborn sometimes.

721
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,563
Give yourself room to breathe.

722
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,073
Did you know?

723
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:06,120
You learned how to read
before any other prince.

724
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,955
Is that true?

725
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,543
That made your mother
extremely proud of you.

726
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,799
But it also made her
have high expectations for you.

727
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,010
She seemed truly happy

728
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,889
when you used to read books aloud to her.

729
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,141
She really did.

730
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,201
Go on.

731
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,050
PRINCE SIMSO

732
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,227
Will the two of them

733
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,605
be all right?

734
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,482
Even between parent and child,

735
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,819
it takes time for wounds to heal.

736
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,822
But between parent and child,

737
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,701
some things are unspoken

738
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,330
but still understood.

739
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,461
Monk Haeham,

740
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:19,962
I humbly request an audience.

741
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,510
My goodness.

742
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,599
How can I help you?

743
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,311
Was your name Seo Ham-deok
before you became a monk?

744
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,566
Who are you?

745
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,195
"Hear, Seo Ham-deok."

746
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,656
"You are hereby appointed as the head
of the Royal Commandery Division."

747
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,533
"Accept the edict immediately,
take the palanquin,

748
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:49,575
and come to the palace."

749
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,410
Wait.

750
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,206
How can a monk become
the head of the Royal Commandery Division?

751
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,958
You have the wrong person.

752
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,835
Regardless of the royal command,

753
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,879
I will be taking you to the palace
in a different manner.

754
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:16,686
Were you the rat that went through
my chamber last night?

755
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,355
Why are military strategies
hidden in a Buddhist text?

756
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:22,108
And why is this ground plan
behind the wallpaper?

757
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,110
You will have to explain that to me first.

758
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,863
My goodness.

759
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,407
You little…

760
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,874
Arrest Monk Haeham for murder.

761
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,794
Murder? What are you talking about?

762
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:42,920
What is going on?

763
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,673
He is suspected of murdering
Choi Gil-myeong last night.

764
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,133
-What…
-Take him away.

765
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,926
-Yes, Chief.
-Choi Gil-myeong?

766
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,679
Who is that? Murder who?

767
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,306
Murder?

768
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,648
Did you see that man fighting
with Choi Gil-myeong?

769
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,901
They made a scene at the market yesterday.

770
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,944
He held a knife to Choi's neck and said,

771
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,488
-"Show up in front of me again,
-Show up in front of me again,

772
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,616
-and I will slit your throat."
-and I will slit your throat.

773
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,076
-My goodness.
-Oh, no.

774
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,620
-How dreadful.
-Goodness.

775
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,371
Goodness gracious.

776
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,624
Is this yours?

777
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,917
Is that not Choi?

778
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,793
HAEHAM

779
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,797
It is, but I did not kill him.

780
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:27,882
Yes, you did.

781
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,801
When the deceased
caught you having an affair with his wife,

782
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,554
you had a fight with him to cover it up.

783
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,307
In the end, you murdered him.

784
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,391
Halt!

785
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,067
Magistrate.

786
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,654
A murderer who leaves a knife
with his name on it at the scene.

787
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:51,489
Is that not strange?

788
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:58,287
The statement of the suspect
does make sense to me.

789
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,748
I suggest you find someone
who can prove his tracks

790
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,500
and reconsider the matter.

791
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,379
Yes, Lord Inspector.

792
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,095
My goodness.

793
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,347
Thank you.

794
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:20,893
Without you, I would have ended up
being framed for murder.

795
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:25,982
Unfortunately, you will still
not be able to avoid the death penalty.

796
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:30,861
You saw how solid
the evidence and witness are yourself.

797
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,446
It was not me.

798
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,407
I know. It was not you.

799
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,994
After the brawl
with Choi Gil-myeong yesterday,

800
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:41,622
you headed straight to a tavern
and drank until the nineteenth hour.

801
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,582
And you returned to Dongeun Temple.

802
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,543
Yes, that is correct.

803
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,336
You were asleep in your chamber

804
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,630
when Choi Gil-myeong was murdered.

805
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,717
You seem to speak

806
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,761
as if you saw everything.

807
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,146
Yes.

808
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,274
You fell into my trap.

809
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,823
Who are you, you bastard?

810
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:25,332
Accept this royal edict
and follow me to the palace,

811
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,126
and I will clear your name.

812
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:33,507
Whether you leave this place alive or dead

813
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,636
is up to you.

814
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,147
The villagers sometimes come here to pray.

815
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,191
But I feel rather reluctant to go in,

816
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,943
so I will stay out here.

817
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,849
This is a map that
shows the location of the armory.

818
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,353
Seo Ham-deok is plotting treason.

819
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,528
Your Grace.

820
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,739
The much-awaited event

821
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,617
will take place soon.

822
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,748
I will return to the palace soon.

823
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,126
So please wait a little longer.

824
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:46,432
Physician Kwon was in charge
of treating Consort Hwang?

825
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:47,391
Yes, Your Majesty.

826
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:51,604
He treated her stomach ulcer
a few years ago.

827
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,194
The two of them knew each other?

828
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,779
There is more, Your Majesty.

829
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:05,910
It was on her recommendation
that he took charge of the Crown Prince.

830
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:13,000
She recommended him?

831
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,801
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

832
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,671
Look into the connection between the
Chief State Councilor and Physician Kwon.

833
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,215
Now that I found out there is a nobleman
who defrauds the people,

834
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:02,967
I must right this wrong no matter what.

835
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,678
I wish to bring Physician Kwon
back to the palace.

836
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:09,265
May I ask why you wish
to bring him back to the palace?

837
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,517
Leave this island now.

838
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,559
Right now!

839
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,978
This is a great chance

840
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,814
to drag the Queen down
along with Grand Prince Gyeseong.

841
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:18,440
You must hurry.

842
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,234
Grand Prince Gyeseong's life is in danger.

843
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:23,612
Your Majesty,
what kind of trick are you playing?

844
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:30,035
