00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,292
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,731
Play that secret game with me
instead of the Grand Heir.

4
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,029
Are you also the one
who poisoned his meal?

5
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,072
No, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,240
That was not me.

7
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,450
I swear.

8
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,495
But you did stick him with a needle?

9
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,538
Who is it?

10
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,123
Whose order was it?

11
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,836
They took my family hostage.

12
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,464
So I had no choice.

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,758
Kill me, Your Majesty.

14
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,426
Very well then.

15
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,094
I will.

16
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,014
If you wish to die without pain,

17
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,683
tell me who was behind it.

18
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,564
If I tell you,

19
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,193
my family will die.

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,657
Tell me who was behind it,

21
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,452
and I will save your family.

22
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,746
So tell me this instant.

23
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,792
You will not…

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,004
be able to do so.

25
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,466
They are…

26
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,262
far more formidable than you,

27
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,890
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,356
No!

29
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,566
-Do not!
-Lady!

30
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,817
-Lady!
-No!

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,485
-No!
-Lady!

32
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,154
No…

33
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,294
Search thoroughly!

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,922
If poison is found,
all your families will be annihilated!

35
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,391
There is a problem, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,566
What happened?

37
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,443
There was a small fire.

38
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,154
Fortunately, it was
extinguished immediately.

39
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,823
But it could have been very bad.

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,168
-Court Lady Shin.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,798
Starting now, no one may enter my quarters

42
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,760
without my permission.

43
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,180
I cannot…

44
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,266
trust anyone anymore.

45
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,018
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,355
What should we do
about the interrogation tomorrow?

47
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,191
If something happens to you,

48
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,902
His Highness the Grand Heir
will be in great danger.

49
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,907
Keep an eye out

50
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,451
for the movements of the Queen Dowager.

51
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,703
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,293
Your Majesty, you should come out.

53
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,301
Your Majesty.

54
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,221
Allow me to leave the palace.

55
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,181
Crown Princess.

56
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,225
I lost my husband

57
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,227
in this palace.

58
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,854
I do not wish to lose my children as well.

59
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,774
Please allow me to leave the palace.

60
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,653
I cannot do that.

61
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,863
Someone poisoned
the meal of the Grand Heir

62
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,573
and set fire to his bedchamber.

63
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,742
In your quarters, at that.

64
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,746
And we have not been
able to find any evidence,

65
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,040
let alone the suspect.

66
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,003
As long as the Grand Heir
stays in the palace,

67
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,672
the murder attempts will continue.

68
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,174
He is not any safer outside the palace.

69
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,761
Your Majesty, I beg you.

70
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,680
What are you all waiting for?

71
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,807
Escort the Crown Princess to her chamber.

72
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,808
Yes, Your Majesty.

73
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,022
Your Royal Highness!

74
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,192
What do you think you are doing?

75
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,822
What can a woman possibly do
after losing her husband?

76
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,782
If something happens to the Grand Heir,

77
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,452
I will have no reason to live.

78
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,329
Is a woman unable to do anything

79
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,497
after losing her husband?

80
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,626
You must pull yourself together
and survive

81
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,629
to be able to protect your son

82
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,757
and yourself.

83
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,924
No, Your Majesty.

84
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,595
Leaving the palace is the only way

85
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,388
to protect him.

86
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,475
So please allow me.

87
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,895
If you do not,

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,189
I will take my life right here.

89
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,736
You are a mother.

90
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,614
How could you point a knife at yourself?

91
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,367
If I were you,

92
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,621
I would use that bravery
to protect the Grand Heir.

93
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,338
Why did you halt the interrogation?

94
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,841
The Queen killed the Crown Prince.

95
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,342
She should pay the price.

96
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,637
How can you be so certain of that?

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,515
No parent in the world
would kill their own child.

98
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,642
If you keep being this way,

99
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,936
I will have to step in.

100
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,939
It is not hard

101
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,607
to bring the Queen down.

102
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,525
Sure.

103
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,987
You have done it once.
Of course, you can do it again.

104
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,991
Deposing the Queen
should be child's play for you.

105
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,993
-Your Majesty!
-What is it?

106
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,289
Will you also replace the King
if I do not listen to you?

107
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,710
What are you so afraid of?

108
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,672
Just what are you so afraid of?

109
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,134
Everything.

110
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,763
I am scared
of the court officials out there

111
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,391
as well as my mother
who is standing in front of me.

112
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,354
I fear the Queen has something to do
with the medicine from the outside.

113
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:05,902
I am also dreading people being reminded
of the death of Crown Prince Taein

114
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,614
and that they will drag me
off this filthy throne!

115
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,200
I fear all of it.

116
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,285
Did you just say

117
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,954
the throne was filthy?

118
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,083
After

119
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,295
all that I went through…

120
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,965
to put you on that throne?

121
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,345
It was not for my sake.
It was for your own sake, was it not?

122
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,138
You wanted it too.

123
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,893
You are the one…

124
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,646
who started all this,

125
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,690
not I.

126
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,786
What do I lack
that the Crown Prince possesses?

127
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,665
Why am I not even given a chance?

128
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,128
I want to be the Crown Prince, Mother.

129
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,680
If you had not wanted it,

130
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,350
I would not even have started.

131
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,479
So,

132
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,235
are you saying this throne belongs to you?

133
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,152
It does not.

134
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,905
I am

135
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,740
the King.

136
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,659
And I am the one

137
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,079
who made you king.

138
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,111
Give your consent to the taekhyeon.

139
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,405
If you do not,

140
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:19,160
I will bring the Queen down
with my own hands.

141
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,255
It was revealed that the medicine
from the outside killed the Crown Prince.

142
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,842
And the person who brought it in
was Her Majesty the Queen.

143
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,977
Can you hear anything?
What is she saying? Is she all right?

144
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,187
Be quiet.

145
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,647
Hey, move.

146
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,067
-I cannot hear anything because of you.
-Move it.

147
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,986
My goodness.

148
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,279
Your Highness.

149
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,533
What brings all of you here?

150
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,951
Mother.

151
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,131
See? I told you she would be okay.

152
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,800
You were worried more than any of us were.

153
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,093
That is not true.

154
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,761
You were.

155
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,181
We came because they wanted
to see how you were doing.

156
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,274
I heard you skipped your meal.

157
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,002
Did you

158
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,046
come because you were worried about me?

159
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,969
I heard you went through a lot
at the interrogation today.

160
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,140
It was no big deal.

161
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,602
You should take care of yourself, Mother.

162
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,938
We brought your favorite,
chicken dumplings.

163
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,691
They have little fat
so are easy on the stomach.

164
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,609
I see.

165
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,277
You came at the right time.

166
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,905
I was starting to feel hungry.

167
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,925
It tastes good.

168
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,804
By the way, Mother,

169
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,351
if the taekhyeon is approved,
will my brothers and I be killed?

170
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,685
Yul.

171
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,442
Who said that?

172
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,237
Some eunuchs said

173
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,240
when Father became the Crown Prince,

174
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,408
all the Grand Princes were killed.

175
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,161
No.

176
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,791
I will never let that happen

177
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,502
on my watch.

178
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,797
So do not worry too much.

179
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,136
Are you not scared, Mother?

180
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,392
I am.

181
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,354
However,

182
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,734
when I see all of you,

183
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,572
all my fear is swept away.

184
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,328
It was not Mother.

185
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,622
I am the one who brought in the medicine.

186
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,791
I went out of the palace
and had it prescribed.

187
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,964
Did you directly hand it to Physician Kwon

188
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,009
or did you hand it to the Queen?

189
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,683
It was revealed
that the medicine killed the Crown Prince.

190
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,059
That means

191
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,979
you might have to take all the blame.

192
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,481
There was nothing wrong with the medicine.

193
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,818
Since I did it to save my brother,
I will take full responsibility.

194
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,946
I will come clean and prove
the medicine did not kill him.

195
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,908
What makes you think
people will believe what you say?

196
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,326
How will you prove it?

197
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,785
I will have the physician
and the herbalist testify

198
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,454
that it was prescribed
according to the prescription book.

199
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,205
You could do that.

200
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,248
However,

201
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,960
if you cannot prove that the medicine
is not the cause of his death,

202
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,130
you could die.

203
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,592
It is too risky.

204
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,220
So leave it to your elders
and stay out of it.

205
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,016
This is a request I am making
as your father, not as the King.

206
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,684
No, I cannot do that.

207
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,355
If I do, I will be admitting
my brother died because of the medicine.

208
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,690
As I said, this is too risky
for you to handle.

209
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,817
Are you telling me to live in guilt?

210
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,237
I cannot be the person
who killed his brother.

211
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,247
A person who killed

212
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,292
his brother…

213
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,684
Are you confident?

214
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,478
I must do it.

215
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,819
Bring the witnesses
before the interrogation

216
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,531
and prove the medicine
did not cause his death.

217
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,325
This is an order I give you

218
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,619
as the King.

219
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,886
Here.

220
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,223
Over here.

221
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,599
-Over here.
-Here.

222
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,186
Did you look into the deceased nursemaid?

223
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,023
She entered the palace
as a maid of the Queen Dowager

224
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,817
on the recommendation
of Chief State Councilor.

225
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,819
And before serving His Grand Heir,

226
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,529
she raised Prince Simso.

227
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,948
So it is difficult to determine
who was behind her.

228
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,829
Did you find anything
in Suragan, the Royal Kitchen?

229
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:22,082
We examined all the food
that was served to His Grand Heir,

230
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,584
but no poison was found in it.

231
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,506
He has been fortunate so far,

232
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,510
but I can only protect him for so long.

233
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,554
Therefore,

234
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,599
we must find some sort of evidence

235
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,769
and find out who the enemy is.

236
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,149
The Queen is a rat in a trap now.

237
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,819
She must be occupied
with His Grand Heir at the moment.

238
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,615
She will attempt to meet
with Physician Kwon, will she not?

239
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,116
She will.

240
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,409
Most likely.

241
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,329
That would be her only way out,

242
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,791
but since I will stop her,

243
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,793
you do not have to worry.

244
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,046
You have not visited me in a while.

245
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,048
You must have been quite busy.

246
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,468
But no matter how busy you were,

247
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,679
you should have reported it to me.

248
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,184
I do not understand what you mean.

249
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,658
I am asking why you hid that the Queen
met with the deposed Queen Yoon.

250
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,702
Tell me.

251
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,871
What did the deposed queen say?

252
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,041
I do not know, Your Royal Highness.

253
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,754
You ungrateful wench.

254
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,466
Did you forget Her Royal Highness
has been watching over your family?

255
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,055
I took you in because you seemed
to be clever and close-mouthed

256
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,723
for a seven-year-old.

257
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,562
But I did not expect you to use
your intelligence to stab me in the back.

258
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,441
Do you serve another person now?

259
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,403
I have always

260
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,989
served the same person.

261
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,201
I have run a few errands for you
to repay your kindness,

262
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,622
but I have never been a sword stabbing
Her Majesty the Queen, my master.

263
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,295
Even though I was kind enough
to take in a miserable dog,

264
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,799
you have never considered me your master?

265
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,344
Are you not afraid of death?

266
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,515
Even a stray dog serves only one master

267
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,101
whom it has given its heart to.

268
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,944
I am letting you go today.

269
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,323
But do not forget that I am the one

270
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,533
holding your leash.

271
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,092
What about Mak-ryeo?

272
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,011
She has been missing.

273
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,680
Find her at all costs

274
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,058
before the Queen gets hold of her.

275
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,601
By the way, Your Royal Highness,

276
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,269
do you intend to bring up

277
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,521
the deposed queen tomorrow
at the interrogation?

278
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,440
No.

279
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,070
That would be too risky.

280
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,951
I knew it.

281
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,078
I was right.

282
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,582
She would have already brought up
the deposed queen if she was going to.

283
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,292
So why has she not?

284
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,586
Because it is something
she can use to her advantage

285
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,756
but is too risky to do so.

286
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,054
I heard something unbelievable.

287
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,308
Are you…

288
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,061
the one

289
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,690
behind the death of the Crown Prince?

290
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,899
You are right.

291
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,402
I killed your son.

292
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,444
But…

293
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,155
do you have evidence?

294
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,865
The Queen Dowager

295
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,786
would never want what she did
to be made public.

296
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,622
I am going out.

297
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,957
Get ready.

298
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,834
Your Majesty.

299
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,921
Even if you go there, you will not
be able to see Physician Kwon.

300
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,675
Seeing him is not my goal.

301
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,260
Pardon?

302
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,469
Then why…

303
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,848
Halt!

304
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,058
How insolent!

305
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,602
Do you realize
who you are pointing your spear at?

306
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,567
Show respect to Her Majesty the Queen.

307
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,487
Step aside.

308
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,159
With all due respect, His Majesty
forbade anyone from entering.

309
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,536
I said, step aside.

310
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,996
What is going on?

311
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,921
Your Majesty.

312
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,467
What brings you here this late at night?

313
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,137
Are you here to get your story straight
with the criminal?

314
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,055
Yes.

315
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,183
I need to keep Physician Kwon
under control

316
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,727
for me to have a chance
at the interrogation.

317
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,524
You must have been feeling anxious.

318
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:46,031
Then would you mind if I told His Majesty
that you attempted to collude with him?

319
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,240
Collude?

320
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,745
I am just trying to make sure he will not
be tortured to make a false confession.

321
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,290
Are you sure you are not afraid
he will confess the truth?

322
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,334
How dare you!

323
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,795
Make way this instant.

324
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,632
There has been a royal command!

325
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,843
Do you intend to disobey
the order of His Majesty?

326
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,971
Chief State Councilor!

327
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,016
Your Majesty.

328
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,977
The only person
who may cross this threshold tonight

329
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,814
is His Majesty the King.

330
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,645
It must be hard for you.

331
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,083
Remain strong just a little longer.

332
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,336
It will all be over soon.

333
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,238
-Wait for me!
-Hurry!

334
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,257
Where is Master Toji?

335
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,384
He left recently.

336
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,928
What do you mean?

337
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,973
He said he had no reason to stay here,
for the plague is coming to an end.

338
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,892
Do you know where he went?

339
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,060
I do not.

340
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:23,855
He left so suddenly
that we did not even get to bid farewell.

341
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,665
The interrogation will begin shortly.

342
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,886
Have you heard anything
from Grand Prince Seongnam yet?

343
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,888
Sire.

344
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,099
Answer.

345
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,893
How did you know
Master Toji was in the hut village?

346
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,229
-Sire.
-Answer me.

347
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,563
An herb gatherer told me.

348
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,276
Master Toji only uses
fresh ginseng from a certain dispensary.

349
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,568
And where is that?

350
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:01,119
The body of the Crown Prince
revealed no evidence that he was poisoned.

351
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,080
Also, there was no sign of poison
during his autopsy.

352
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,540
The investigation proved

353
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,293
that the medicine from the outside
caused his death.

354
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,672
Answer me, Royal Physician Cho.

355
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,051
Could the medicine have caused his death?

356
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,469
Yes, Your Majesty.

357
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,679
A treatment not found
in the prescription book

358
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,557
can be as lethal as stabbing a patient

359
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,517
in their vital points.

360
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,686
I am certain that the cause of his death

361
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,147
is the use of a medicine
of an unidentified origin

362
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,901
and a prescription
not found in the prescription book.

363
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,991
It has become clear

364
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,285
that the Crown Prince

365
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,331
was not poisoned but died because of
the medicine brought from the outside.

366
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,461
Answer me, Physician Kwon.

367
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:57,217
Who gave you the medicine
that killed the Crown Prince?

368
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,233
Disclose the source now!

369
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,703
It was Her Majesty the Queen.

370
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,385
Let me ask you one more time.

371
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,804
You must be completely honest with me.

372
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,934
Who gave you the medicine
that was prescribed outside the palace?

373
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,185
I am telling the truth.

374
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,814
Her Majesty the Queen gave it to me.

375
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,568
Let me ask you, My Queen.

376
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,447
Is what he said true?

377
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,828
Your Majesty.

378
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,372
Give your answer.

379
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:16,796
Yes.

380
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,093
I gave it to Physician Kwon.

381
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,436
However,

382
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,982
I do not agree that the medicine
caused the Crown Prince to die.

383
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,278
Just because he was not poisoned

384
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,989
does not mean
he died because of the medicine.

385
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,657
Whether you agree or not,

386
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,535
it has already been concluded
that the medicine was the cause.

387
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,001
If I had thought
the medicine would be so dangerous,

388
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,087
I would never have given it

389
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,467
to my dear child.

390
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,638
And I received…

391
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,726
the medicine from someone else.

392
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,398
It was from a person
who cared about him more than anyone

393
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,400
and someone whom I trusted fully.

394
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,404
That is why I did not question

395
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,782
the safety of the medicine at all.

396
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,493
You received it from someone else?

397
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,371
That medicine killed the Crown Prince!

398
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:35,750
Who is the person
who gave that wicked medicine to you?

399
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,131
Give your answer, My Queen.

400
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,983
It was the Crown Princess.

401
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,910
The Crown Princess…

402
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,333
She gave it to me…

403
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,629
in person.

404
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,511
She said she had been giving it
to him for some time,

405
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,848
so I assumed that
it would not be a problem.

406
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,271
Search her quarters.

407
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:43,735
Her Royal Highness began decocting
his medicine herself quite some time ago.

408
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,570
I merely thought

409
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:49,532
she seemed very concerned about his health
even while heavily pregnant.

410
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,952
She refused any help

411
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,955
and insisted on decocting
his medicine by herself.

412
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,260
This medicine is certainly
from outside the palace, Your Majesty.

413
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,846
It was not me, Your Majesty.

414
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,182
I did decoct medicine
for the chronic itching

415
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,808
of His Royal Highness,

416
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,144
but all the herbs
were from inside the palace.

417
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,564
In that case, there should be
records at the Royal Pharmacy.

418
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,399
Bring the records immediately.

419
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,075
There are no such records left
at Naeyakbang, the Royal Pharmacy.

420
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,077
It was not me.

421
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,870
This is unfair.

422
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,791
Your Majesty,
why are you doing this to me?

423
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,419
This is unfair. I am innocent.

424
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,879
Enough, Crown Princess.

425
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,008
I had no choice.

426
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,928
That medicine

427
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,056
killed my son.

428
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,865
We will end…

429
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,161
the interrogation.

430
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,090
The Queen

431
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,801
surprised me greatly.

432
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,222
I never imagined

433
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,433
she would accuse the Crown Princess.

434
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:43,229
With Physician Kwon under our control,
she must have had no other choice.

435
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,523
She sacrificed the Crown Princess

436
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,651
to save her own skin.

437
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,779
This will make it harder for us
to remove the Queen, will it not?

438
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,242
We must push forward no matter what.

439
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,039
Perhaps this is our chance

440
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,168
to remove both the Queen
and His Grand Heir.

441
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:12,008
I beseech you
to hold the Queen responsible

442
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,427
for using medicine from the outside.

443
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,431
Please depose the Queen.

444
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,641
-Depose the Queen
-Depose the Queen

445
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,935
-and execute His Grand Heir.
-and execute His Grand Heir.

446
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,064
All she did was hand over the medicine.

447
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,734
Therefore, her deposition
is out of the question.

448
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,735
Your Majesty.

449
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:35,490
The Queen cannot escape responsibility
for the death of the Crown Prince.

450
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,366
I forbid any further discussion.

451
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,367
Your Majesty.

452
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,204
The heir to the throne passed away.

453
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,247
It is no different from treason.

454
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,042
Someone must take responsibility.

455
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,712
If the Queen cannot be deposed,

456
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,799
I beseech you to execute

457
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,967
the Crown Princess' family
and His Grand Heir

458
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,552
to prevent future treason.

459
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,888
-Execute them, Your Majesty.
-Execute them, Your Majesty.

460
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,313
Lord Hwang Won-hyeong.

461
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,984
Do you want the Grand Heir dead so badly?

462
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:20,201
Will you finally be satisfied
when that young boy dies as well?

463
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,904
Father, it was not the Crown Princess.

464
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,867
She has nothing to do
with the medicine from the outside.

465
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,996
You say you brought it in,

466
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,998
while the Queen blames the Crown Princess.

467
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,624
What is the truth?

468
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,543
What am I supposed to believe?

469
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,545
I brought in the medicine.

470
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,423
What happened to the witnesses
that you promised to bring?

471
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,633
Both the physician
and the herbalist are gone.

472
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,759
However,

473
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,137
I will find them no matter what.

474
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,639
It is all over now.

475
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,683
You lost your chance.

476
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,268
We cannot stop here.

477
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,395
Why are you giving up like this?

478
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,650
How dare you try to lecture the King?

479
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,112
I did not give up.

480
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,740
You missed your chance.

481
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,084
They proved the medicine killed him,

482
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,670
and the Crown Princess confessed

483
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,173
while you failed to bring witnesses

484
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,051
or prove them wrong.

485
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,511
It is all over now.

486
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,930
Father.

487
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,933
Do you truly intend to end it like this?

488
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,772
Do you think

489
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,608
the King can do whatever he wants?

490
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:19,028
If the King cannot, then who can?

491
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,490
Is there really

492
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,201
nothing that can be done?

493
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,909
Let her know I am here.

494
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,619
Her Royal Highness has gone to bed.

495
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,037
I said, let her know.

496
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,456
As I said, she has already gone to bed.

497
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,958
Let her know I am here.

498
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,629
Your Royal Highness,
the Queen would like to--

499
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,676
Have you lost your mind?

500
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,596
Yes. How can I possibly be
in my right mind in this situation?

501
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,683
So you need to help me.

502
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,310
Why should I?

503
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:37,481
You should have quietly locked yourself
in your quarters in the first place.

504
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,484
How dare you meet
with the traitor Queen Yoon?

505
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,695
Did you not know that is deemed treason?

506
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,530
My son was fighting for his life.

507
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,450
That is why, instead of locking myself
in my quarters,

508
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,412
I met with a mother who lost her son
under similar circumstances.

509
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,373
How could you call that treason?

510
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,833
Your Majesty.

511
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,418
Yes?

512
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,380
Are you not curious

513
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,592
about what she told me?

514
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,554
She told me…

515
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,516
Crown Prince Taein
did not die from his illness.

516
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,523
Do you not think
his death is rather strange?

517
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,112
If he had not died like that,

518
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,284
His Majesty, the son of a mere concubine,

519
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,330
would not have been
able to ascend the throne.

520
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,749
Your Majesty!

521
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,630
Are you reminded of what happened then?

522
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,884
I heard that you admitted

523
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,138
to having murdered Crown Prince Taein.

524
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,309
Seeing how upset you are,

525
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,771
it must be true.

526
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,023
Shut

527
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,025
your mouth.

528
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,945
If you persuade the court officials,

529
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,031
I will keep my mouth shut.

530
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,034
Your Royal Highness.

531
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,495
Chief State Councilor is here.

532
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,834
I asked him to come.

533
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,211
Send him in.

534
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,469
You should stop here.

535
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,972
I suggest we stop…

536
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,268
playing this game.

537
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,730
Did you not push those kids

538
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,359
to the edge of a cliff
to protect your position as the Queen?

539
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,362
What are you trying to do now?

540
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,407
Taekhyeon.

541
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,245
I give my approval.

542
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,331
That was your goal

543
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,918
when you started this game, was it not?

544
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,503
Your Majesty.

545
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,882
The taekhyeon is inevitable.

546
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,843
So why should I do as you say?

547
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,969
Chief State Councilor.

548
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,306
Do you truly believe

549
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,932
you can kill me,

550
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,144
the Crown Princess, and the Grand Heir
if you persist?

551
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,188
Are you confident?

552
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:27,276
You tampered with the witness
and framed me.

553
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,153
Did you think I would not know?

554
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,204
The two of you must realize
what an unreasonable demand it is

555
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,832
to have the Crown Princess
and the Grand Heir executed.

556
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,504
So I suggest we stop this game

557
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,174
and demote the Crown Princess
and the Grand Heir to commoners.

558
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,718
Did you say…

559
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,888
we should demote them to commoners?

560
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:57,890
Yes.

561
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,017
In return,

562
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,437
if none of the Grand Princes become
the Crown Prince through the taekhyeon,

563
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,941
I will…

564
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,028
step down as queen.

565
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,243
I want your answer now.

566
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:23,165
I might change my mind
once I step out of this room.

567
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,546
Was that what you were after?

568
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,382
You wish to expel

569
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,592
your daughter-in-law and grandson

570
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,971
to save your own skin?

571
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,055
Yes.

572
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,934
Even if all my limbs are cut off,

573
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,270
I will have to hold on
to my head and heart

574
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,566
if I am to stand any chance.

575
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,153
I will…

576
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,200
persuade His Majesty.

577
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,547
So the Queen will keep her position,

578
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,757
and His Grand Heir will remain alive?

579
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,886
Once Prince Uiseong becomes
the Crown Prince through the taekhyeon,

580
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,389
I will bring the Queen down as I promised.

581
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,144
And do you intend
to keep His Grand Heir alive?

582
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,229
Of course not.

583
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,066
It will be easier to get rid of him now.

584
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,611
Hunting is much easier

585
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,071
outside the palace than inside.

586
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:42,369
As soon as he leaves the palace,
he is as good as dead.

587
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,665
I grant your request, officials.

588
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,835
Physician Kwon O-gyeong will be dismissed

589
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,546
for failing to treat
the Crown Prince properly.

590
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,050
The Crown Princess,
who caused the Crown Prince to die,

591
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,594
will be demoted to a commoner.

592
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,098
The Grand Heir will also be demoted to
a commoner and placed under wirianchi.

593
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,142
WIRIANCHI: IMPRISONING EXILED CRIMINALS
WITH THORNS FENCED AROUND THE HOUSE

594
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,644
Any interaction with them

595
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,772
will be seen as attempting
to put the Grand Heir on the throne

596
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,066
and will be treated as treason.

597
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,458
This is unbelievable.

598
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,377
Is Her Majesty not even going to watch

599
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,213
His Grand Heir leave the palace?

600
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,590
Did you not hear?
She demoted the Crown Princess

601
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,176
to protect her position.

602
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,637
I feel so sorry for His Grand Heir.

603
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,721
Halt!

604
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,860
Uncle…

605
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,066
You did not do anything wrong.

606
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,694
Uncle…

607
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,116
Wait for me.

608
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,910
I will come for you.

609
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,628
How could she do that to the Crown Prince?

610
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,755
She tried to enthrone His Grand Heir.

611
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,884
-She is being punished!
-You are right.

612
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,219
How could she do such a thing?

613
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,685
As there will be too many eyes on the way,

614
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,812
get rid of him at the place of exile.

615
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,149
Kill him as soon as they arrive.

616
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,247
Chief!

617
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,668
What do you mean?

618
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,795
Then where in the world did they go?

619
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,255
Answer me!

620
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,194
Grandmother.

621
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,488
My grandson.

622
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,164
Your Majesty.

623
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,549
Will you be able to endure it?

624
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,592
Yes.

625
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:11,388
I will do anything
to protect the life of the Grand Heir.

626
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,600
Very well.

627
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,394
As you wish,

628
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,772
I will let you out of the palace.

629
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,776
And I will find a safer place for you.

630
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,070
Once you arrive there,

631
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,866
no one will be able to harm
the Grand Heir.

632
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,704
I will…

633
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,373
summon you

634
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,793
back to the palace in time.

635
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,880
Do not be

636
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,924
scared anymore.

637
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,093
Do not fear anything.

638
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,098
Run around happily

639
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,351
and laugh as much as you want.

640
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,742
Yes, I did that to protect my position.

641
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,494
How…

642
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,205
How could you do that?

643
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,791
I need to remain in my position

644
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,626
to be able to protect you

645
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,711
and my grandchildren.

646
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,172
We have lost the Grand Heir.

647
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,760
You sacrificed him and the Crown Princess
to protect your position.

648
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,011
No.

649
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,305
This is the only way to protect them.

650
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,182
That is merely an excuse.

651
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:41,228
You expelled the Grand Heir
from the palace.

652
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,731
I will bring them back here.

653
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,533
Will you…

654
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,161
join me?

655
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,373
What do you mean by that?

656
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,297
Kang.

657
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,093
Will you be able to replace your brother?

658
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,183
What I mean is,
you must become the Crown Prince.

659
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,582
Yes, Mother.

660
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,542
I will try.

661
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,879
If I can put things right,

662
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,590
I am ready to risk everything

663
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,426
to become the Crown Prince.

664
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,095
Pardon?

665
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,182
Do you mean you knew
Chief State Councilor would appear

666
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,518
on your way to Uigeumbu,
the State Tribunal?

667
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,020
Yes.

668
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:09,107
I had to pretend to be anxious
to make him let his guard down.

669
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:13,236
Why did you not tell me then?

670
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,739
I really had no idea.

671
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,157
Your Majesty.

672
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,662
-Did you visit his house?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

673
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,917
But Physician Kwon
has already covered up his tracks.

674
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,587
He left this behind.

675
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,560
I am leaving
because I cannot bring myself to face you.

676
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:52,442
I ended up making a confession
because I could not endure the torture.

677
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,903
However,

678
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,991
I am convinced that the medicine
did not kill the Crown Prince.

679
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,163
I apologize for failing to protect you.

680
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,792
It has been a long time, Master.

681
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,012
By the way, Your Majesty,

682
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,722
his neighbors said

683
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,100
Physician Kwon
does not have an old mother.

684
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,563
Find out more about him.

685
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

686
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,526
Find out when and how
he entered the palace.

687
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,449
Find out where he is from as well.

688
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,751
I heard you put your position on the line.

689
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,088
Do you not know what the taekhyeon means?

690
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,382
I do.

691
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,552
I should be the last king
enthroned by them.

692
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:04,222
I cannot allow another taekhyeon.

693
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,599
No.

694
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:10,020
You should restore
the true meaning of the taekhyeon.

695
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,398
Originally,

696
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,651
the taekhyeon aimed to select
the worthiest one,

697
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,530
not the one
favored by the court officials.

698
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,953
"Even though I was enthroned
by the court officials,

699
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,247
I wish to be a king

700
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,792
who fears his people,
not his court officials."

701
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,963
It has been 20 years,

702
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,632
but…

703
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,593
I still remember what you said.

704
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,184
When I heard those words,

705
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,270
I realized what a great man you were.

706
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:01,237
None of the Grand Princes
might become the Crown Prince.

707
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,949
Yes, they might not.

708
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,119
However,

709
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,706
I trust them.

710
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,918
Why do you think
I put my position on the line?

711
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,505
I will not be able to bear it

712
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:24,052
if someone other than the Grand Princes
becomes the Crown Prince.

713
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,764
Then there will be no point
in being the Queen any longer.

714
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,808
I am prepared.

715
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,186
Only,

716
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,898
I have one request.

717
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,320
Do judge the candidates fairly

718
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,490
and select the most qualified one

719
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,618
to become the Crown Prince.

720
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,118
The next Crown Prince

721
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,495
will be selected through the taekhyeon.

722
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:39,335
All the princes will be candidates
regardless of their birth.

723
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,340
We will obey your order, Your Majesty.

724
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:48,094
-Much obliged, Your Majesty.
-Much obliged, Your Majesty.

725
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,264
However, as for the selection process,

726
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,141
I will decide myself.

727
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,770
Your Majesty, the taekhyeon, originally--

728
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,438
The taekhyeon, originally,

729
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,692
was intended to select the worthiest one,

730
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,944
not the one
favored by you court officials.

731
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,739
What is it?

732
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,824
Is there a problem?

733
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,624
Your Majesty.

734
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,335
Why did you approve the taekhyeon?

735
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,295
It would have been inevitable anyway.

736
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,715
But I did not want to be forced.

737
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,260
If one cannot stop the waves,
one must ride them.

738
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,680
But the taekhyeon is disadvantageous
to the Grand Princes.

739
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,349
Precisely.

740
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,518
Everyone must think so.

741
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,145
That will give my sons an advantage.

742
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,230
Pardon?

743
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,526
I am not that reckless.

744
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,821
I am thoroughly confident.

745
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,869
Are you sure?

746
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,204
You heard me.

747
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,559
Do you realize

748
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,728
what you are returning to me?

749
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,275
It is a book that holds the secrets
of the education of the royal family.

750
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,736
This is unexpected.

751
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,159
I thought you wanted to be
the Crown Prince more than anyone.

752
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,663
Did your mother send you here?

753
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:42,333
She does not know I am here.

754
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,880
Have you decided it will not be of help
to you in becoming the Crown Prince?

755
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,549
Yes.

756
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,052
I do not think

757
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,764
that book made Father ascend the throne.

758
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:02,395
He became the Crown Prince because
he had someone like you as his mother.

759
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,315
However,

760
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,777
the real reason he ascended the throne

761
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:14,866
was that he was
the worthiest prince of all.

762
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,786
Then…

763
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,917
what can I help you with?

764
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,543
Please…

765
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,213
do the same for me.

766
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,679
As you all must know,

767
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,308
the next Crown Prince will be selected

768
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,227
through the taekhyeon.

769
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,231
And to do that,

770
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,150
there will be a contest.

771
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,735
-A contest?
-A contest?

772
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,111
What contest?

773
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,448
-This is unexpected.
-What are you talking about, Your Majesty?

774
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,493
That has never happened before.

775
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,329
What is the problem?
It sounds wonderful to me.

776
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,580
Your Majesty.

777
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:06,334
Is it not against the rules
to select one through a contest?

778
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,336
If we were to adhere to the rules,

779
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,839
His Grand Heir or one of the direct heirs
should become the Crown Prince.

780
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:17,220
Then when will this contest begin?

781
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,934
It has already begun.

782
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,228
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

783
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:40,785
Who are you?

784
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,760
Where are you taking me?

785
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,023
Wait!

786
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,902
What is the matter?

787
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,823
I am looking for a handsome man
who ran off with my money.

788
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,660
Have you seen this man?

789
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,288
No, I do not think I have.

790
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,915
How could you not be sure?
He is such a handsome man.

791
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,000
What?

792
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,420
Then forget it. Be on your way.

793
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,591
She has gone insane at such a young age.

794
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:37,800
Goodness.

795
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,348
Excuse me.

796
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,766
What do you think of me?

797
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,434
-I--
-Forget it.

798
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,061
Forget it then.

799
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,277
Where in the world are you?

800
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,172
We will begin the contest

801
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,966
to select the Crown Prince.

802
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,763
You may all change.

803
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,863
Reach the finishing point
before the incense clock burns out.

804
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,551
The points will be given
according to the order of arrival.

805
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,723
Also,

806
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,435
those who give up or become eliminated

807
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:14,147
will retrieve their hopae,
identification plaques, themselves.

808
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,027
The prince who keeps
his nameplate in place to the end

809
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,155
will be the next Crown Prince.

810
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,060
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

811
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,339
The concubines are making unusual moves.

812
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:22,465
During the contest,

813
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:25,676
you will not be considered princes,
but inspectors.

814
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,512
I am here to apologize
to my mother-in-law.

815
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,305
What other motive could I hold?

816
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:31,974
Do I have the face of a Crown Prince?

817
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,101
Even if one of my Grand Princes
ascends the throne,

818
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,646
I will make sure you keep your position.

819
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:39,398
Who would dare to attack
Grand Prince Seongnam?

820
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,610
I will not let the ones who tried to
hurt my son live to see another day.

821
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,071
Things have been so unfair until this day.

822
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,907
Does anyone here know what this arrow is?

823
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:53,621
