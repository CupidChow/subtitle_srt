1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,700
EPISODE 12

3
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,624
Mother.

4
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,088
It is your first day as the Crown Prince.

5
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,466
How could I not come by?

6
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,888
Why do you keep smiling?

7
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,350
I cannot help

8
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,354
but smile just by looking at your face.

9
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,775
-Are you that happy?
-Of course.

10
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,361
Just look.

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,948
You look great in the royal dragon robe.

12
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,952
No matter how busy you are,

13
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,621
you should take a stroll
all around the palace.

14
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,833
Give the court ladies
something to smile about too.

15
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,470
Is this not a hoseul, a knee guard?

16
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,806
Yes, Crown Prince.

17
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,432
From now on,

18
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,228
you will have more occasions to bow
than you did as a grand prince.

19
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,606
Once you begin to study at Sigangwon,

20
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,527
you must kneel and bow to your tutors
before your classes.

21
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,531
At times, you will have to read
while kneeling down without a desk.

22
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,491
The Crown Prince

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,493
must serve his tutors,

24
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,579
the King,

25
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,166
and his people.

26
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,376
Yes, Mother.

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,546
I will always carry out my duties
with modesty.

28
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,800
Although it is a position
everyone wishes to rise to,

29
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,890
you will also face difficulties
at every moment.

30
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,893
I am ready to face them.

31
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,817
Mother.

32
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,694
I must go now.

33
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,279
Yes.

34
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,489
You should go.

35
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,634
Did you have a good night?

36
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,719
I am here to greet you.

37
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,722
You look quite different

38
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,017
with your new attire, Crown Prince.

39
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,604
I must have gotten used to my life
in the palace.

40
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,523
I will fill my eyes with what I see,

41
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,400
remember what I hear,

42
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,779
and if I must, speak forthrightly
as the Crown Prince.

43
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,239
Yes.

44
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,910
Always be alert
and devote yourself to everything you do.

45
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,375
There is a dragon with four claws

46
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,379
embroidered on the chest
of the Crown Prince's robe.

47
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,966
Only when you become the King

48
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:23,513
do you receive the King's symbol,
a dragon with five claws.

49
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,101
The additional claw
may not seem like much.

50
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,815
But there are quite a number
of those who have disappeared

51
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,150
without obtaining that final claw.

52
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,613
The use of the claws
is more important than the amount.

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,616
I shall not use

54
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,078
those claws to dominate the people
and hurt them,

55
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,122
but to keep them safe.

56
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,059
My brother, Prince Uiseong.

57
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,145
Have you been well?

58
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,148
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

59
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:42,508
Why did you summon Seo Ham-deok and me
to the palace, Your Majesty?

60
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,596
Are you planning to get rid of
your political opponents

61
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,431
who are nuisances to you?

62
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,310
I could just hold them accountable
for defying the King and kill them.

63
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,104
Why would I go through such a hassle?

64
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,028
But your sword
can be pointed at me anytime.

65
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,280
You are different.

66
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,743
Be my Minister of Taxation
and save the struggling economy.

67
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,081
There is another position I wish to take.

68
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,959
I will only remain in the palace
if you allow me to take this position.

69
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,421
Are you trying to negotiate with the King?

70
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,343
It is a deal proposed by a peddler
from outside of the palace walls.

71
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,140
Very well.

72
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,308
Tell me.

73
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,811
What is the position you want?

74
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,232
Seoyeongwan.

75
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,400
SEOYEONGWAN: OFFICIAL IN CHARGE
OF THE CROWN PRINCE'S EDUCATION

76
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,282
I will appoint you as Seoyeongwan

77
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,743
if you will also be
the Minister of Taxation.

78
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,247
Negotiating in the palace
is not about compromising.

79
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,207
You make the other party give up.

80
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,210
Therefore, I shall not back down either.

81
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,258
You have changed a lot.

82
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,887
So you must also stay alert

83
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,889
to survive…

84
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,517
in this palace.

85
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,368
Grandmother.

86
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,329
Please stay healthy and well.

87
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,458
It is quite sad to hear

88
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,211
that you will leave the palace
to live on your own.

89
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,383
His Majesty gave him a residence
near the palace.

90
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,261
So please do not be so sad.

91
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,932
My dear Prince Uiseong

92
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,353
is the first grandson I held in my arms.

93
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,358
He is very special to me.

94
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,170
I will…

95
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,051
always keep my eyes on you,
Prince Uiseong.

96
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,949
I will return to the palace.

97
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,201
Yes.

98
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,370
Be sure to return.

99
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,998
I shall make it happen.

100
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,211
Your Majesty, the jogang,
morning lesson, has begun.

101
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,337
I see.

102
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,468
What is wrong, Your Majesty?

103
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,722
I am afraid his first class
may turn into sinbangrye.

104
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,808
Is that not

105
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,395
the welcoming orientation
for new scholars at Sungkyunkwan?

106
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,647
That is the official meaning.

107
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,108
But they use the welcoming as an excuse

108
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,653
to give difficult assignments
and humiliate the new arrivals.

109
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,699
It is a welcoming orientation
and a severe hazing ritual.

110
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,786
The first day at Sigangwon is the same.

111
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,332
The tutors ask difficult questions
to make him devote himself to his studies.

112
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,918
Some will use that chance

113
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,338
to find fault with the Crown Prince.

114
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,424
I do not know about the others,

115
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,552
but Chief State Councilor
will not let go of this chance.

116
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,891
I hope the Crown Prince
overcomes their harsh hazing.

117
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,149
What do you believe is the difference
between a turbulent and a peaceful time?

118
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,860
The time of a sage king
is called a peaceful time,

119
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,030
and the time of a futile king
is called a turbulent time.

120
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,993
Then what do you believe
is the King's duty in a turbulent time?

121
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,997
He must be wise in his ways
of handling the war.

122
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,708
How shall he handle it?

123
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,712
The King of a turbulent time
should not raise an army recklessly.

124
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,591
Sun Tzu said,
"Move not unless you see an advantage."

125
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,844
"Fight not unless faced with danger."

126
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,429
He is right.

127
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,224
He must first try to solve it
through diplomacy to avoid war.

128
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,101
That is incorrect.

129
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,520
That is not the case in a turbulent time.

130
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,651
Taking military action
to make the enemy take a step back

131
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,903
is a key diplomatic strategy.

132
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,780
That is the way to win the war

133
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,991
and bring benefit to the kingdom.

134
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,827
If we must fight, we must fight and win.

135
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,329
However,

136
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,083
what is more important than victory
is ending the war quickly.

137
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,629
Because the people are the ones
getting hurt during the war.

138
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,259
Chief State Councilor,
do you believe this is a turbulent time?

139
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,723
Is the King's duty in a turbulent time
so important in this time of peace?

140
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,350
Why do you ask such a question?

141
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,606
If we relax our vigilance
when the kingdom is at peace,

142
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:35,152
the military government becomes restful,
and we will certainly become vulnerable.

143
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,613
If we have a worthy king

144
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,282
and worthy ministers,

145
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,702
we will be able to handle
any danger sagaciously.

146
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,209
I will consider your question
as your high expectation of me.

147
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,397
TONG, OUTSTANDING

148
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,909
"The Crown Prince has been crowned."

149
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,871
"All women eligible to marry
are prohibited from marrying."

150
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,582
A marriage ban has already been imposed?

151
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,669
These are the three young ladies
the Queen Dowager wants

152
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,421
for the Three-Step Selection.

153
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,424
The eldest daughter
of the Minister of Personnel.

154
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,011
The niece of the
chief magistrate of Hanseong Magistracy.

155
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,555
The second daughter
of the Minister of War.

156
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,438
If one of the Queen Dowager's people
becomes the Crown Princess,

157
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,316
it will be hard
for the Crown Prince to hold his position.

158
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,485
I must stop that.

159
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,570
Is there a way?

160
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,407
Bring me a list of young ladies
unrelated to the Queen Dowager.

161
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,370
We must find a strong candidate
and recommend her.

162
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,545
The granddaughter
of the Left State Councilor.

163
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,465
Oh, my.

164
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,177
That yellow makes your skin look too dull.

165
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,888
-Take it off.
-Yes, Mother.

166
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,226
It does not look great on her.

167
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,644
We will not take it.

168
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,230
But my lady,

169
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,774
the garment was tailored
to the young lady.

170
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,151
I need you to pay for it.

171
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,155
Are you telling us to buy a garment
that does not suit her?

172
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,281
Well…

173
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,618
Goodness, there is
powder and rouge on this.

174
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,995
I cannot sell this to anyone else.

175
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,664
It was not me.

176
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,957
Pardon?

177
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,544
I checked the condition
before you tried it on.

178
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,630
Are you suggesting that I am lying?

179
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,799
Goodness, that is not what I meant.

180
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,051
Let us visit Gu's store.

181
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,930
She is here.

182
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,847
Goodness, my lady.

183
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,391
She is known to be modest and gentle

184
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,393
and is the eldest daughter
of the Right Associate State Councilor.

185
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,769
Is the garment ready?

186
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,480
I am so sorry.

187
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,774
One of my helpers here

188
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,235
sold the garment you ordered by mistake.

189
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,362
-Goodness.
-What do you mean?

190
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,782
I asked you to take extra care
as it is for the selection.

191
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,450
But it was sold to someone else?

192
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,078
Mother, it is for the better.

193
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,289
Look at this silk.

194
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,916
I like this design
more than the previous one.

195
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,209
Goodness, yes.

196
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,837
This silk just arrived today.

197
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,797
Then make me another one with this.

198
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,048
Of course, young lady.

199
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,303
I will find the best seamstress
in the capital and tell her to hurry.

200
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,515
This garment is important, so ask her
to take her time and take extra care.

201
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,642
Yes, of course.

202
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,227
Please put in extra care.

203
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,397
ELDEST DAUGHTER
OF THE RIGHT ASSOCIATE STATE COUNCILOR

204
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,026
Goodness, our young lady
seems fine by day,

205
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,069
but she cries her heart out every night.

206
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,529
Why?

207
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,947
How would I know?

208
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,366
She must have had stress
piled up in her heart.

209
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,160
She sighs all the time.

210
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,413
Whenever I am with her,
I also feel exhausted

211
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,165
and depressed.

212
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,791
That is just pitiful.

213
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,544
My young lady is an idiot.

214
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,755
She is just so ignorant.

215
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,051
I cannot believe
she was born of her father.

216
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,346
So what if she is ignorant? It is fine
as long as she is good at heart.

217
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,807
Come to think about it,
there is no fault with my young lady.

218
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,894
Not only is she a beauty,
but her heart is made of gold,

219
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,978
and she is also smart.

220
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,107
If she were a man,
she would have passed the state exam.

221
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,401
And? Anything else?

222
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,365
Do I have to show you this too?

223
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,449
Look.

224
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,993
Who would embroider

225
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,829
the socks of a handmaiden?

226
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,289
This is my life.

227
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,583
Whose family do you serve?

228
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,501
Me?

229
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,004
I serve the family
of the Chief Royal Secretary.

230
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,464
You know, right?

231
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,757
Chief Royal Secretary?

232
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,550
Min Seung-yun?

233
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,679
How dare you speak of his name like that?

234
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,099
Anyhow.

235
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,436
I have not seen such flawless skin
on a commoner.

236
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,692
Come to think of it,
there is no dirt on your neck or nails.

237
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,532
Your lord must adore you a lot.

238
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,285
You are right.

239
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,080
Why did you not show it off?

240
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,040
She seemed different.

241
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,638
ELDEST DAUGHTER
OF THE HEADMASTER OF SUNGKYUNKWAN

242
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,476
How dare you, you filthy thing?

243
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,772
SECOND DAUGHTER OF THE SECTION CHIEF
OF THE MINISTRY OF RITES

244
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,362
ELDEST DAUGHTER
OF THE LEFT ASSISTANT ROYAL SECRETARY

245
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,374
That young lady. Whose daughter is she?

246
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,085
The eldest of the Chief Royal Secretary.

247
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,551
I think I finally have found her.

248
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:36,430
The eldest of the Chief Royal Secretary
is a great person.

249
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,933
She is gentle and educated,
and she is great to her handmaidens.

250
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,731
ELDEST DAUGHTER
OF THE CHIEF ROYAL SECRETARY

251
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,110
I cannot believe this.
You are trying to defraud her.

252
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,949
Give her the amount
she deserves for the hairpin.

253
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,453
I told you,
I have given her more than she deserves.

254
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,582
The one who is selling this does not care.
Why are you meddling in this?

255
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,709
I just cannot believe it.

256
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,421
I cannot just ignore it
when you are trying to defraud her.

257
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,424
She could have gotten at least 30 nyang.

258
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,218
-What now? Ten nyang?
-What?

259
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,803
-Goodness.
-That is cheap.

260
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,763
Well, hang on.

261
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,807
Are you two acquainted or something?

262
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,354
Us? We have passed each other by.

263
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,483
You probably have no idea
since you only met her,

264
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,195
but this woman was deserted
because she could not bear a child.

265
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,114
The front of her garment is cut.

266
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,740
She is a divorced woman!

267
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,159
-He is right.
-It really is cut.

268
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,579
So what?

269
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,124
That has nothing to do
with the price of this hairpin.

270
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,792
Of course, it matters.

271
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,295
Who would buy an article
from a deserted woman? It is bad luck.

272
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,133
Only a generous man like me
would pay ten nyang for that.

273
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,093
Is that so?

274
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,555
Let me borrow it for a moment.

275
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,102
If I offer this golden hairpin,
does anyone want to take it?

276
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,813
-Me! I want it!
-I will take it!

277
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,189
Give it to me.

278
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,401
-What?
-What is she doing?

279
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,153
-Goodness.
-What is with her?

280
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,489
Does anyone still want it?

281
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,199
-Me!
-I want it!

282
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,534
-I will take it!
-I will.

283
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,702
-Give it to me.
-I want it.

284
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,704
-Me!
-Who cares? It is still gold.

285
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,623
See? No matter what you do
to this golden hairpin,

286
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,667
its value does not diminish.

287
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,335
The same goes for her!

288
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,590
So you must pay her
the same amount as anybody else.

289
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,717
Goodness, I will be generous.

290
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,343
Here is 20 nyang. Take it or leave it.

291
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,428
I will buy it.

292
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,562
If I offer you 30 nyang,

293
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,938
will you sell it to me?

294
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,190
Thirty?

295
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,649
Thirty?

296
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,777
Here is 35 nyang.

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,446
Is this good enough?

298
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,448
I will take the hairpin.

299
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,699
-Look at him.
-Goodness.

300
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,036
-He is as good as a thief.
-Goodness.

301
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,371
Thank you for your help.

302
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,875
Thank you.

303
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,547
Thanks to you, I will be able
to afford food for a while.

304
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,591
I am glad you got its worth.

305
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,926
Thank you.

306
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,114
She looks like a nobleman's daughter.

307
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,534
Is she not on our list?

308
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,829
Oh, my. She is the eldest daughter
of the Minister of War.

309
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,873
Minister of War?

310
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,724
For what reason did you help that woman?

311
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,311
Is it not too cruel

312
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,106
that her husband can divorce her

313
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,191
just because she could not bear a child?

314
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,195
The Seven Valid Causes for Divorce

315
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,948
is the legal ground
for a man to legally desert his wife.

316
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,994
At times, it turns immoral
and creates innocent victims.

317
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,329
I do not understand.

318
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,957
If there is such a law,

319
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,959
why is there no law that protects women?

320
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,711
There is.

321
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,922
It is called Sambulgeo,
the Three Exceptions.

322
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,008
-Sambulgeo?
-Yes.

323
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:45,137
There is a law
that protects married women.

324
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,765
If she mourned her parents-in-law
for three years,

325
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,019
if the family obtained wealth
after their marriage,

326
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,895
or if she has no family to return to,

327
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,981
the man may not desert his wife

328
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,942
even if she pertains to
the Seven Valid Causes for Divorce.

329
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,069
I see.

330
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,947
The law gives the husband a spear,

331
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,743
whereas it gives the wife a shield.

332
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,786
But here is the problem.

333
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,706
Most women know
the Seven Valid Causes for Divorce,

334
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,834
but they do not know about Sambulgeo.

335
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,046
There is a law
to help them protect themselves,

336
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,423
but they are unaware of such a right.

337
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,302
Or it may be

338
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,972
that she could not have the right
even if she did know.

339
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,183
I am right.

340
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,353
The law provides seven spears,
but only three shields.

341
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,232
If the woman is stabbed by one of them,
she will get hurt, will she not?

342
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,163
Your Royal Highness.

343
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,002
How did you travel this far
without any forewarning?

344
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:10,597
From ancient times, it is said
that one turns red near a stamp pad,

345
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,101
and one turns black near an ink stick.

346
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,395
What does this adage mean?

347
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,982
It means one is affected greatly
by those around them.

348
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:26,238
Who is that someone to you?

349
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,198
My parents.

350
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,158
From the day I was born until now,

351
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,787
I have learned from them
and tried to be like them.

352
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,207
One's parents
are the child's first teachers.

353
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,751
So they must always set an example

354
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,129
with a rightful mind and just behavior.

355
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,639
Do you not wish to submit
a participation form for the selection?

356
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,267
-A participation form?
-Yes.

357
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,477
Everyone wants to be the Crown Princess.

358
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,231
But you do not seem interested.

359
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,568
How would I live forever
in that suffocating palace?

360
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,570
I do not want that.

361
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,241
There is not a lot of time left
for you to participate.

362
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,951
Do consider it.

363
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,870
I am not interested.

364
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,121
I am

365
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,583
already in love with someone.

366
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,753
He may be the Crown Prince, but I cannot
live with someone without love.

367
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,090
I do not know who he is,

368
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,177
but he must be quite a great man.

369
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,470
Yes.

370
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,557
I thought he was only handsome.

371
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,767
But after spending a few days together,

372
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:42,314
I also realized he is a fine man
through and through.

373
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,732
Do you wish to see him?

374
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,649
Sure.

375
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,331
How…

376
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,083
do you know him?

377
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,585
Pardon?

378
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,379
He is the Crown Prince.

379
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,176
Goodness, that is nonsense.

380
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,721
He is an inspector
who works for the kingdom,

381
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,848
but not the Crown Prince.

382
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,436
I recently saw him
working as an inspector on an island.

383
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,272
I am a woman of the palace.

384
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,860
How could I not know
what His Royal Highness looks like?

385
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,493
Is he really the Crown Prince?

386
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,874
By any chance,

387
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,503
are you a senior court lady?

388
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,172
Yes.

389
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,219
If he is really the Crown Prince…

390
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,765
It could have been bad.

391
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,602
Senior Court Lady,
I will never forget your kindness.

392
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,649
If you participate in the selection,

393
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,443
you cannot tell anybody

394
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,280
that you have already met
the Crown Prince.

395
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,116
-Why?
-The royal family is very strict.

396
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,245
It will not help
if the elders find out that you have

397
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,289
met the Crown Prince in private.

398
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,208
I will remember that.

399
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,713
Senior Court Lady!

400
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,298
See you again in the palace!

401
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,401
It is so pretty.

402
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,919
It really is.

403
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,734
There are such shells everywhere,

404
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,653
but I will keep…

405
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,911
that one's other half.

406
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,792
So if we meet once again,

407
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,252
please consider it fate.

408
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,820
Your Royal Highness, this is your eunuch.

409
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,078
Your Royal Highness,
your evening lesson will begin soon.

410
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,038
Let us go.

411
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,837
Minister Yoon, you have done a good job
in bringing up your daughters.

412
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,800
There is no fault I can find in these
young ladies of a prestigious family.

413
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,387
You are very generous,
Your Royal Highness.

414
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,516
Father!

415
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,438
Father, I want to be the Crown Princess.

416
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,606
You have not submitted
the participation form, have you?

417
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,067
Then I want to go.

418
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:56,985
Later.

419
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,987
Let us talk later.

420
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,822
There is no later.

421
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,950
Please allow me to go to the palace.

422
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,578
I will no longer
speak casually with anybody

423
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,580
or lift up my skirt as I walk,

424
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,291
and I will walk carefully
and stop leaving home.

425
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,003
Father.

426
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,630
I have to be the Crown Princess.

427
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,759
It has to be me no matter what.

428
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,845
Why must you become the Crown Princess?

429
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,227
No, Your Majesty.

430
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,272
She is the daughter of Minister Yoon.

431
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,107
It is Minister Yoon we are speaking of.

432
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,318
He is the hands and feet
of the Queen Dowager.

433
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,195
And his eldest is such an unruly girl

434
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,405
that even matchmakers
do not make her an offer.

435
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,950
Why did you tell her to participate?

436
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,913
I already thought this through.

437
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,466
I asked why you must
become the Crown Princess.

438
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,596
If you participate in the selection,

439
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,890
you cannot tell anybody

440
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,559
that you have already met
the Crown Prince.

441
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,941
Because I wish to rise
to the highest position.

442
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,570
The highest position
allowed for a woman of noble birth

443
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,155
is the queenship, is it not?

444
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,826
That is why I wish to become
the Crown Princess.

445
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,704
This is the only way I can meet him.

446
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,668
This is a royal marriage.

447
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,504
Not anybody can do it
only because they want to.

448
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,549
You must have wanted to see me in private

449
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,176
because you did not think
I was just anybody.

450
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,471
In that case,

451
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,226
will you stand on my side?

452
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,645
Stand your side, Your Royal Highness?

453
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:57,897
Yes.

454
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,360
From now on,
you must not keep any secrets from me.

455
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,864
As his grandmother,

456
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,950
I am quite worried about the Crown Prince

457
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,163
who was crowned without preparation
because of his brother's sudden death.

458
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,417
What if he does not settle?

459
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,836
What if he does not have enough power?

460
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,508
He was crowned after a difficult contest,

461
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,220
so I must know everything
to give him my support.

462
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,474
Will you do that for me?

463
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,613
Why in the world do you wish
to have her as the Crown Princess?

464
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,909
I want to know
if you have any other intentions.

465
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:56,539
I told you that one of your daughters
shall become the Crown Princess.

466
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,417
I am simply trying to keep my promise.

467
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,880
I have served you for 20 years,
Your Royal Highness.

468
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,382
Do you think I would not know?

469
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,092
In the end,

470
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,428
you are trying to use her

471
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,348
to bring down the Crown Prince.

472
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,647
Please tell me what your plan is.

473
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,485
Yes, she may be used in said way.

474
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,613
However, you still have

475
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,659
two other daughters.

476
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:40,792
Crown Prince, are you not interested
in the Crown Princess selection?

477
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,669
If you and elders

478
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,797
find me a Crown Princess, I shall abide.

479
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,969
I believe this marriage
is a part of my duty as the Crown Prince.

480
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,263
Establishing myself as the Crown Prince

481
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,808
is how I can do my part
for the royal family.

482
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,477
Yes.

483
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,648
It has been 20 years
since His Majesty ascended the throne,

484
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:09,404
but the royal family is still
being threatened by a group of rebels.

485
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,574
So I hope you will

486
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,411
find a great Crown Princess

487
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,664
and have a child as soon as possible.

488
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,835
I will remember that.

489
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,592
By any chance, is there a woman
you have set your heart on?

490
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,643
Father.

491
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,103
I said no.

492
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,022
How many times must I say it?

493
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,108
Father, please.

494
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,568
Please.

495
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,737
Father.

496
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,199
Halt!

497
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,040
I suddenly jumped in like this.

498
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,210
As you already know,
I am very well-trained.

499
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,504
Listen.

500
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,631
You better take your hands off that woman.

501
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,844
I thought I warned you.

502
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,854
My bravery stood out so brightly.

503
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,899
-This was the first time
-This was the first time

504
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,776
-I saved Cho-wol.
-I saved Cho-wol.

505
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,655
I always show up whenever she needs me,

506
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,033
so she must have realized
we were meant to be.

507
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:42,246
That is why we had no choice
but to spend the night together.

508
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,418
-Cho-wol…
-Cho-wol

509
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,463
was as pretty as the moon of that night.

510
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,802
Brother.

511
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,513
You have told us that story
numerous times now.

512
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,098
What? Really?

513
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,562
But why have you two
remained friends until now?

514
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,607
It is…

515
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,444
because of the promise made that night.

516
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,162
Thank you for helping me.

517
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,040
You must protect yourself next time.

518
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,875
If anyone treats you with disdain,

519
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,293
confront them confidently.

520
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,426
I am only a flower of a courtesan house

521
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,762
and am unscented.

522
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,390
Bees.

523
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,976
Do not dream of falling on the flower.

524
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,103
Sit on the willow, then leave.

525
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,022
Do you write poetry?

526
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,817
I mix this and that
and pretend I wrote it.

527
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,197
Please give me your hand.

528
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:05,204
It has not been long since we met.
Do you already wish to hold my hand?

529
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,462
What is this?

530
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,924
It is a full moon,
but once you peel it, it is a half moon.

531
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,515
Please be my congenial friend.

532
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,976
I wish to be a friend
who writes poetry together.

533
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:32,648
Do you only wish to be friends
with a handsome man like me?

534
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,444
I am not a courtesan,
but I am still of lowly birth.

535
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,239
I cannot be with a nobleman anyway.

536
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,327
Only friends can continue
to meet like this.

537
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,496
Then do not fall for me.

538
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,374
You must never harbor feelings for me.

539
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,253
Really?

540
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,674
I wish to see you for a very long time.

541
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,011
What do you mean?

542
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,679
Cho-wol left?

543
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,098
Why?

544
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,100
Where did she go?

545
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,560
I do not know either.

546
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,364
Your Majesty,
Physician Kwon is in Hanseong.

547
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,740
Hanseong?

548
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,119
Where in Hanseong is he now?

549
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,330
Someone saw him in Seochon.

550
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,337
Why did he suddenly return to Hanseong?

551
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,386
Trace his whereabouts.

552
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,806
Find out where he went

553
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,307
and who he met.

554
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,559
Find out every little detail.

555
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:06,075
The interrogation will begin soon.
You must leave before then.

556
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,453
Is there a way?

557
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,464
Once you drink this, you will
suffocate and convulse temporarily.

558
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,759
Once you are sent to the Royal Clinic,
I will get you out.

559
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,643
You know everything.

560
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,397
We must stop you
from undergoing an interrogation.

561
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,111
What is the matter?

562
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:43,988
What is going on?

563
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,412
Hey!

564
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,622
Hey!

565
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,376
A criminal took poison and died
in the palace prison?

566
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,128
How does this make any sense?

567
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,921
I apologize, Your Majesty.

568
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,258
What did you find in Mount Gyeryong
and Seo Ham-deok's base?

569
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,635
They ran away without leaving any trace,

570
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,472
so I was unable to find any evidence.

571
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,231
What about the ones that made contact
with the deposed Queen Yoon and her son?

572
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,983
I watched them for months,

573
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,778
but no one came to visit them,

574
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,614
and they did not show
any suspicious movement.

575
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,159
No.

576
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:32,953
No.

577
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,123
There must be people
who are in league with them.

578
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,959
Keep them under your watch at all times.

579
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,461
Yes, Your Majesty.

580
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,630
We must get rid of the rebels

581
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,590
who are yet to be exposed.

582
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,261
There may be an accomplice
within the palace,

583
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,055
so continue to investigate.

584
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,645
Lord Seo Ham-deok has taken his own life.

585
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,733
He took all the blame with him
for the sake of our rebellion.

586
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,113
Once the interrogation began,
we could have fallen in danger too,

587
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,074
so he did not have a choice.

588
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,702
We cannot let the will of Lord Seo
disappear in vain.

589
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,123
We cannot hold ourselves back
because of this incident.

590
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,836
In this situation,
what we need is a justification

591
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,879
to revolt against the King.

592
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,716
In order to do so, we must prove
that Crown Prince Taein

593
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,761
did not pass of illness, but was murdered.

594
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,388
Do you understand?

595
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,597
-Yes.
-Yes.

596
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:14,805
BOKGEOMSIHYEONGDO:
A DRAWING OF THE STATE OF A DEAD BODY

597
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,727
The only one who can clarify
the death of the Crown Prince…

598
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,355
is Physician Kwon.

599
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,400
What will you do with him?

600
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,635
I must return to the palace.

601
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,305
I need you to help me.

602
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,475
Yes, do return.

603
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,562
I also need your help.

604
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,361
What poison

605
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,822
did you use on the Crown Prince back then?

606
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,376
Your Majesty.

607
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,419
The eldest daughter of the Minister of War

608
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,838
is participating
in the Crown Princess selection.

609
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,716
Why did the Queen Dowager change her mind

610
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,344
and choose that problematic young lady?

611
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,805
She is not satisfied

612
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,600
with simply having a Crown Princess
who will stand on her side.

613
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,186
In the end,

614
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,857
she will show her claws
against the Crown Prince.

615
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,362
Why did you choose the eldest

616
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,614
instead of his second or third daughter?

617
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,659
In order to shake
the position of the Crown Prince,

618
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,911
instead of giving him the best bride,

619
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,624
I must gift him the worst bride.

620
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,613
That was fun.

621
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,921
I wish to select Lady Yoon,

622
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,215
the eldest of the Minister of War.

623
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,300
I am against your decision.

624
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,763
Lady Yoon seemed too free and easy.

625
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,015
Is that so?

626
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,562
She looked much more poised than you
when I first saw you

627
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,731
during the selection.

628
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,027
I also believe
the daughter of the Minister of War

629
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,197
does not lack anything
to proceed to the Three-Step Selection.

630
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:04,284
She does not seem like
Crown Princess material to me.

631
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,202
I must

632
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,915
promote Lady Yoon
for the Three-Step Selection.

633
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,795
So you can also recommend
a candidate of your own.

634
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,881
In that case,

635
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:23,762
I would like to promote
the daughter of Lord Min Seung-yun.

636
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,472
Your Royal Highness.

637
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,851
Her Majesty supports the daughter
of the Chief Royal Secretary,

638
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:32,271
and the Queen Dowager supports
the daughter of the Minister of War.

639
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:36,150
The entire palace is buzzing
and wondering which one of them

640
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,652
will become the Crown Princess.

641
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,033
Only the quarters of Your Royal Highness
are this quiet.

642
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:50,372
Your Royal Highness,
do you not want to know who will make it?

643
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,531
Lady Min.

644
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,950
Why do you not sit on the cushion?

645
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,207
It has the name of my father,

646
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,918
so I cannot dare to sit on it.

647
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,429
Lady Yoon, you must have a different idea.

648
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,267
This is simply a cushion I am sitting on.

649
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,397
A piece of paper with my father's name
is nothing but a piece of paper.

650
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,984
I am sure my father
is somewhere in this palace

651
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:05,572
praying earnestly
that I become the Crown Princess.

652
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,954
Will you explain
the Seven Valid Causes for Divorce,

653
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,373
the standards for the behavior of a woman?

654
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,668
Lady Min, you may begin.

655
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,463
These are the seven faults
that allow a man to desert his wife.

656
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,008
It is also called Seven Outs
or Seven Reasons to Leave.

657
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,135
It applies when she is insolent
to her parents-in-law,

658
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,096
fails to give birth,

659
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,640
behaves lustfully, becomes jealous,

660
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:35,185
is overly talkative, or steals.

661
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,940
If any one of the seven
applies to one's wife,

662
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:44,570
the husband may demand a divorce
on his own initiative.

663
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,533
Lady Yoon, please.

664
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,703
-Seven Valid Causes for Divorce is--
-Lady Yoon.

665
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,789
Instead of that,

666
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:59,042
tell us what Sambulgeo,
the Three Exceptions, is.

667
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,130
If there is such a law,

668
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,132
why is there no law that protects women?

669
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,466
There is.

670
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,094
It is called Sambulgeo,
the Three Exceptions.

671
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,263
The question does not seem fair.

672
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,642
Why do you ask such a question
only to Lady Yoon?

673
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,185
The other two young ladies

674
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,147
gave a great answer already
about the Seven Valid Causes for Divorce.

675
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,567
So I wish to ask Lady Yoon
a different question.

676
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,613
If you do not think this is fair,

677
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,700
the other two young ladies may feel free

678
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,411
to speak up first.

679
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,504
Please allow me to answer.

680
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:51,261
Sambulgeo is like three shields.

681
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,348
Three shields?

682
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,017
What do you mean by that?

683
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,394
These three reasons are why a man

684
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,856
cannot leave his wife even if she pertains
to the Seven Valid Causes for Divorce.

685
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,068
In return for giving the husband a spear,

686
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,196
the wife is provided with a shield.

687
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,380
Your Royal Highness.

688
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,798
Your Royal Highness.

689
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,175
The decision has been made.

690
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,010
The eldest of the Minister of War

691
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,054
has been selected as the Crown Princess.

692
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,099
I see.

693
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,060
One of the Queen Dowager's people
became the Crown Princess.

694
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,730
My daytime lesson
will begin soon. Get ready.

695
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,816
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

696
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,800
Your Royal Highness.

697
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:15,554
This will be your quarters
for a few months until the royal wedding.

698
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,725
We will serve you with utmost care
while you are here.

699
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:27,774
You do not need to show courtesy,
Your Royal Highness.

700
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,443
I see.

701
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,030
We will train the handmaiden
you brought from home

702
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,117
and return her to you when she is ready.

703
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,165
You can follow me.

704
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,772
Your Majesty.

705
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,523
Are you really Her Majesty the Queen?

706
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,404
Why did you not tell me
that you are Her Majesty?

707
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,823
I did not have any idea.

708
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,035
I am so glad to meet you again.

709
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,204
You smile

710
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,081
just like your mother.

711
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:26,708
Pardon?

712
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,544
Are you acquainted with my mother?

713
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,804
You have raised your daughter very well.

714
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,431
You are too generous, Your Majesty.

715
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,643
We simply raised her to be healthy.

716
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,229
It is our duty as parents
to watch silently.

717
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,607
Then the child's caliber
will grow bigger on its own.

718
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,150
Yes, you are right.

719
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,820
It is up to our children to fill it.

720
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:55,987
Oh, my.

721
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,324
You and I seem
to understand each other very well.

722
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,035
Your Majesty.

723
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,997
What is the real reason
you have visited us here?

724
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,924
I wish for your eldest daughter to be

725
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,010
selected as the Crown Princess.

726
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,389
The Queen Dowager

727
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,350
also wishes to have her
as the Crown Princess.

728
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,435
Yes, I am aware.

729
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,438
Why must it be her?

730
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,858
I do not wish to sacrifice your daughter

731
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:36,069
like the Queen Dowager wishes to do.

732
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:40,532
I only chose her as the Crown Princess
because she is the most outstanding.

733
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:46,204
I saw your eldest daughter by coincidence.

734
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,584
Unlike other young ladies
who only learn from their books,

735
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,669
she is like a gemstone.

736
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,090
Not only did she step up
and help the weak,

737
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,843
but she was also very compassionate.

738
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:05,765
Is there a better quality than that
as the Crown Princess?

739
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,605
The only concern I had was that

740
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,734
she is your daughter, Minister Yoon.

741
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,906
However, I will use
the power of the Queen Dowager

742
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:24,534
to make your daughter the Crown Princess.

743
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,453
And I will

744
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,205
keep them safe.

745
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,627
So now, Minister Yoon,

746
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,464
I ask you to be
the shield for the Crown Prince.

747
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,426
I will be

748
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,679
the shield for your daughter.

749
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,894
However, Your Majesty,

750
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,065
my daughter does not excel in her studies.

751
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,234
How can she pass
the tough Three-Step Selection?

752
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,950
I already have an idea.

753
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,830
I had to meet my in-laws

754
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,668
before I welcomed my daughter-in-law.

755
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,383
By the way, Your Majesty,
when may I meet the Crown Prince?

756
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,884
Before that,

757
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:27,389
you must take lessons for a while
to become a part of the royal family.

758
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,516
You must do so

759
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,685
to meet the Crown Prince.

760
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,312
I see.

761
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,066
If you finish the lessons quickly,

762
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,111
then you will meet him sooner.

763
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,073
Then I will begin the lessons right now.

764
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,915
You must not move your shoulders or head.

765
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,127
Please keep your hands together neatly.

766
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,130
Do not take short, quick steps.

767
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,174
You must walk lightly in even strides.

768
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,224
Crown Princess, it is not difficult.

769
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:14,853
Just imagine that you are
going over stepping stones in a brook.

770
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,986
And in the palace, we end up running

771
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,947
much more than walking lightly.

772
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,795
In Jungyong,

773
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,507
there are the desires of your flesh
and the desires of your heart.

774
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,178
Explain how the desires
are different in the two phrases.

775
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,014
The desire of your flesh

776
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,349
is your wish to eat when you are hungry

777
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,935
and your wish to sleep
when you are sleepy.

778
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,439
It means your personal desire
does not concern others.

779
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,108
The desire of your heart

780
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:06,029
is when your desire
is purely private and personal.

781
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,453
Your Royal Highness.

782
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,372
You must learn all this
and retain them by tomorrow.

783
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,049
How can I learn and retain all this?

784
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,430
This is the summary.

785
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:34,432
Just read this.

786
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,604
How can we do our best at all times?

787
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,022
It will wear you out.

788
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,943
My name is Yoon Cheong-ha.

789
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,453
So if we meet once again,

790
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,788
please consider it fate.

791
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,140
The eldest daughter of the Minister of War

792
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,934
stands on the side of the Queen Dowager.

793
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,654
Please consummate your marriage now.

794
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,031
Allow us to leave.

795
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,332
Your Royal Highness!

796
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,764
What did you just say?

797
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,642
I said I came
to find the father of the child.

798
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,824
What?

799
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,993
Who did what?

800
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,081
Who came

801
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,999
with whose child?

802
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,045
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

803
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,578
Since early this morning,

804
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,330
there was a strange rumor
spreading in the palace

805
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,083
so I was worried.

806
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,460
If he cannot ascend you to the throne,

807
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,422
you can always step over him to do so.

808
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,965
I will take responsibility
and raise the child.

809
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,175
It should not be hard
to secretly raise a child.

810
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:05,096
It seems like Physician Kwon
did not only treat hyeolheogwol.

811
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,933
It seems like I have found out something
I should not have.

812
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,810
Would you like to join me

813
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:15,148
in finding out how and why
the late Crown Prince had to die?

814
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:21,362
