00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,125
EPISODE 2

3
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,419
I hope I did not make you uncomfortable

4
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,338
by visiting you at this ungodly hour.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,593
There is nothing
I enjoy more in this palace

6
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,804
than the conversations I have with you.

7
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,557
Please, feel free to visit me anytime.

8
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,447
You are indeed thoughtful,

9
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,200
but I have wronged you and your father.

10
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,203
During the Three-Step Selection,

11
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,581
you were the most favored candidate.

12
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,668
However, the late King, who wished
to keep his maternal relatives in check,

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,713
insisted on selecting a candidate
from a family with no roots.

14
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,509
As a result, you ended up
being a concubine.

15
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,013
Had you become the Queen
as you should have,

16
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,393
the status of Prince Uiseong would have
been very different than now.

17
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,819
It is all in the past.

18
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,197
"All in the past"?

19
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,830
To the east of the palace,

20
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,667
there is a large tree
that I have been especially fond of.

21
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,130
It used to look magnificent
and provided a pleasant shade.

22
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,382
It could not have been more perfect.

23
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,009
But one day,

24
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,514
the roots of the tree
began to rot and dry out.

25
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,142
It has become so fragile now

26
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,519
that even a gentle breeze
could make it fall.

27
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,315
What do you suggest I do?

28
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,318
It should be pulled out

29
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,780
if that is indeed the state it is in…

30
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,662
because it takes hundreds
of years for a new tree to take root.

31
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:50,295
By the way, you do not seem
to be interested in the cohort selection.

32
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,969
I do not think
the position suits Prince Uiseong.

33
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,305
Then…

34
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,601
what about the position
of the Crown Prince?

35
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,109
Hyeolheogwol…

36
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,156
I heard the late Crown Prince Taein
suffered from the same disease.

37
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,867
Was it the disease

38
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,329
that caused him to pass in the end?

39
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,582
That is what everyone says,

40
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,462
but I do not believe

41
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,382
that it was hyeolheogwol
that caused his death.

42
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,802
The royal physician even told us

43
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,306
that Prince Taein
had been cured of his disease.

44
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,267
Do you mean…

45
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:51,231
that there was something else
that caused him to pass on?

46
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,405
Is that you, Ik-hyeon?

47
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:43,116
It was as though they had foreseen

48
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,077
the death of the Crown Prince.

49
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,915
The current King was proclaimed
as the new Crown Prince,

50
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,793
my father was accused of treason,

51
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,254
and I was deposed.

52
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,257
It all happened rapidly in succession.

53
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,844
I would like to ask you this.

54
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:07,682
To my knowledge,
you had four other children.

55
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,770
Should not one of your other sons
have succeeded the Crown Prince?

56
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,982
Then let me ask you this in return.

57
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,987
Have you ever prepared
the other Grand Princes for kingship

58
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,698
apart from providing them
with the most basic education?

59
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,411
I have not.

60
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,538
Of course, you have not.

61
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,042
Such behavior may have made
the other Grand Princes

62
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,044
a threat to the Crown Prince.

63
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,133
That is what sets your sons
apart from those of the concubines.

64
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:49,015
And you must have done that
to protect your other sons.

65
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,895
However, the concubines have been
eagerly waiting and preparing

66
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,357
for the taekhyeon.

67
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,861
Do you mean the process
by which the wisest and worthiest

68
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,907
of the remaining princes
is chosen as the new Crown Prince?

69
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,284
Yes.

70
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,036
You are right.

71
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,290
Being polite, generous, loyal, agile,

72
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,251
and showing mercy willingly

73
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,505
are the five virtues
that lead one to a state of grace.

74
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,510
When none of the sons of the Queen
are worthy as the successor

75
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,346
or all of them do not qualify to rule…

76
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,473
One would be entrusted with more work

77
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,476
-…that system of taekhyeon
-and thus, achieve great things.

78
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:38,397
may justify the inauguration of a son
of a concubine as the new Crown Prince,

79
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:43,444
just as His Majesty
came to inherit the throne.

80
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,366
A wise man rises skyward
to reach truth and morality each day.

81
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,952
He is not concerned with
being acknowledged undeservedly

82
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,248
but strives to improve himself
in order to earn recognition.

83
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,458
OUTSTANDING

84
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,128
Congratulations, First Junior Consort Cho.

85
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,509
This is only the beginning.

86
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,263
Indeed. Now that we have someone
to succeed the title of Crown Prince,

87
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:14,475
it is time to expel
the Queen and the Grand Princes.

88
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,104
For it is you, Your Highness,
who should be Queen.

89
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,241
Therefore, you must prepare yourself.

90
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,244
If you fail to do so,

91
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,372
you risk not only losing the Crown Prince

92
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:41,586
but also the lives
of the other Grand Princes.

93
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,886
I, too…

94
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,307
did not understand this
until it was too late.

95
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,900
No matter how quietly we lived,

96
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,610
the mere existence of my sons

97
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,780
was deemed a threat

98
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,700
by those in power.

99
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,230
And just like that…

100
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:48,903
I ended up losing
the remaining Grand Princes

101
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,367
even though we had not been living

102
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,911
with any desire to reclaim the throne.

103
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,542
The only reason I am still living…

104
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,920
is because I still have

105
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,632
one son remaining

106
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,719
that I must protect.

107
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,474
You asked me

108
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,728
what I would have done
if I were to turn back time.

109
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,482
Although…

110
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:32,071
people may point their fingers at me

111
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,783
and ridicule me for being crude,
cunning, and shameless,

112
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:40,955
I would do anything necessary
to protect my children

113
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,457
if I was still the Queen

114
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,253
and still had the opportunity
to change the course of things.

115
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,304
Your Highness.

116
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,266
Why do you not inform His Majesty
of the condition of the Crown Prince?

117
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:04,645
Would he not be upset
if he were to find out later?

118
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,149
The more upset
His Majesty becomes, the better.

119
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,109
Pardon?

120
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,322
Nothing is more enraging than
something that happens unannounced.

121
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,410
So it has to be the Queen
who kept the condition of the Crown Prince

122
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,120
a secret from His Majesty.

123
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,792
Things will become interesting
starting tomorrow.

124
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,313
Wake up.

125
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,607
Wake up.

126
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,364
It is still the fourth hour.

127
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,993
"Between the third hour and the seventh,

128
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:05,164
the liver, bowels, and gallbladder become
active and stimulate the brain."

129
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,624
That is what is written here.

130
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,417
What book is that?

131
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,005
A book that holds the secrets
of the education of the royal family.

132
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,926
It was through these methods
that His Majesty ascended the throne.

133
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,640
Why do you think
the Queen Dowager gave this book to me?

134
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,852
It must be proof
that she recognizes your brilliance.

135
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:34,193
I have also learned a way to wash
our faces that makes us more intelligent.

136
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,154
We will begin washing our faces
using jisikbeop starting today.

137
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,133
JISIKBEOP:
A BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BREATHING METHOD

138
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,052
IN WHICH ONE HOLDS THEIR BREATH
IN SALT WATER FOR OVER 150 SECONDS

139
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven…

140
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,897
Mastering jisikbeop
enhances your concentration and patience.

141
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,568
Nine. Keep going. Ten.

142
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,320
Good job. You are doing well.

143
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,739
Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four…

144
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,199
You can stop if you have to breathe.

145
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,329
Well done. We will go and have some meat.

146
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,919
You are not done yet.

147
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,629
I cannot hold my breath any longer.

148
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,926
The water is too salty.

149
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,094
And what if it is?

150
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,181
This will help improve
your inventiveness and creativity.

151
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,558
Even the Crown Prince
practices this each morning.

152
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,727
That is because he is the Crown Prince.

153
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,145
Why must I--

154
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,493
This is the 65th time.

155
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,537
The King ends his meal

156
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,415
with water that has been
boiled one hundred times.

157
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,462
It takes a lot of effort
but is said to extend one's lifespan.

158
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,632
The water must cool completely
before it is boiled again.

159
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,133
Only then will it be effective.

160
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,066
Partake in the cohort selection.

161
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,320
Do you not want to
put your abilities to the test?

162
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,156
What do you mean by that?

163
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,451
It is a chance for you
to prove yourself before His Majesty.

164
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,620
Just as you said,

165
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,122
the first son of His Majesty

166
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,208
is you.

167
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,214
Just enter the test

168
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,593
and leave the rest to me.

169
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,391
MULGWIWONJU: RESTORATION OF AN ITEM
TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER

170
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,101
I will return to you

171
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,020
what is rightfully yours.

172
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,467
From now on,

173
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,721
you may do away
with formalities in my presence.

174
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,223
Even when I enter
the room or stand beside you,

175
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,058
do not mind me

176
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,394
and focus on treating the Crown Prince.

177
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,229
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

178
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,858
You may leave for now.

179
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,962
Physician Kwon.

180
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,884
I want you to search
the records of Naeuiwon, the Royal Clinic.

181
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,763
There should be records
of the treatment of Crown Prince Taein.

182
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,725
And find any other records
on the treatment of hyeolheogwol,

183
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,436
but do so discreetly.

184
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,813
Yes, Your Majesty.

185
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,734
Your Highness.

186
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,902
Crown Prince.

187
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,244
His pulse seems to have recovered.

188
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,749
Your Highness.

189
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,710
You have yet to fully recover

190
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,421
so you should not strain yourself.

191
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,971
Crown Prince.

192
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,016
You should lay in bed
a little longer. It is still early.

193
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,269
Mother.

194
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,023
I am sorry to have worried you.

195
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,612
Why did you not tell me
of your illness and make things worse?

196
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,534
Were you afraid
that I would scold you for being ill?

197
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,746
As this illness could remind us
of an unpleasant past,

198
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:43,210
I hesitated to tell you
as I may have caused you grave worry.

199
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,969
Crown Prince.

200
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,600
With treatment, you will recover
and be able to return to your daily life.

201
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,856
So do not worry too much.

202
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,294
I will push them to do it.

203
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,462
Your Majesty.

204
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,214
-That may make things go awry.
-Why?

205
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,010
If you do so,
you might be met with resistance.

206
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,679
If more Grand Princes enter,
there will be a better chance

207
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,556
that one of them becomes the cohort.

208
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,267
I advise you to
persuade them, not force them.

209
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
-Persuade them?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

210
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,611
Please, refrain from
yelling at them and speak softly.

211
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,113
We will see.

212
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,662
I wonder why Mother
summoned us so urgently.

213
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,624
Why else?

214
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,584
She is not one to let such things slide.

215
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,296
Do you think this is about
the incident with Prince Uiseong?

216
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,714
What else could it be?

217
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,341
Do not be so pessimistic.

218
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,011
I am not being pessimistic.
I am being realistic.

219
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,015
Brother!

220
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,477
Are you on your way to the lesson?

221
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,064
Where are you going?

222
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,400
We are on our way
to being scolded by Mother.

223
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,820
Beg for forgiveness.

224
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,862
-Will do!
-Will do!

225
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,922
What could the Grand Prince Gyeseong
be so busy with these days?

226
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,592
You seem to be away all the time.

227
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,094
Hold on.

228
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,973
You are not hiding a girl
in the palace, are you?

229
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,934
Is she pretty?

230
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,593
Grand Prince Gyeseong.

231
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,722
Yes, Mother.

232
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,601
I heard that you are very interested
in learning foreign languages.

233
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,521
Which language
are you the most interested in?

234
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,068
I am interested in Chinese.

235
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,196
-Chinese?
-Yes.

236
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,406
I see.

237
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,577
Grand Prince Ilyeong.

238
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,956
You seem to be interested in
astronomy and divination.

239
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,625
Pardon?

240
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,792
Well, yes.

241
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,171
-Mother.
-Yes?

242
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,881
You are making us uncomfortable.

243
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,133
Please, scold us and be done with it.

244
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,927
You are making me extremely anxious.

245
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,846
Scold you? What is this about?

246
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,684
I was just planning to converse
with the Grand Princes

247
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,312
to learn what your interests are.

248
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,565
-Why all of a sudden?
-Seriously…

249
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,776
What do you mean? I just told you.

250
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,863
I would like to know
what your interests are.

251
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,199
Have you let the news

252
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,285
of the cohort selection get to your head
as it did the concubines?

253
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,787
Watch your mouth!

254
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,497
"Get to my head"?

255
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,627
Everyone is making such a fuss

256
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:59,633
to become a cohort so they can
join our brother at Sigangwon.

257
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,551
Well, I…

258
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,930
This is not about that.

259
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,432
You still must be curious.

260
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,142
Yes, I am.

261
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,812
And what will you do?
Are you partaking in it or not?

262
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,648
Tell me.

263
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,775
Never mind.

264
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,569
I order every one of you to partake.

265
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,737
Your Majesty…

266
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,620
Mother, did you not hear the announcement?

267
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,414
I did.

268
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,958
They said that we need to
partake in it of our own will.

269
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,209
PATIENCE

270
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,502
-I know that.
-Mother.

271
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,088
I have no intention of partaking.

272
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,256
Why not?

273
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,842
The evaluation process looks difficult,
so I do not want to.

274
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,927
-And what about you?
-Mother.

275
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,306
I am busy developing
a portable sundial these days.

276
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,309
I do not think I can make time
to enter the cohort selection.

277
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,226
What?

278
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,437
-You brats!
-I will enter.

279
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,940
If it has to be one of us,

280
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,651
I will gladly do so.

281
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,279
Yes, Grand Prince Gyeseong.

282
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,990
That is a great idea.

283
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,616
LEFT

284
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,452
The rest of you should reconsider.

285
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,953
Why should we?

286
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,998
Really? Give it some thought then!

287
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,916
Although I scold you
whenever you cause trouble,

288
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,462
have I ever nagged you to study?

289
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,631
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY

290
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,303
But you see, even if you get married,

291
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,348
you should at least leave the palace
with some basic education.

292
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,268
Then allow me to get married
so that I may leave the palace.

293
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,729
Mother, I would like to get married too.

294
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,359
You good-for-nothings,
you bring His Majesty shame.

295
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:45,280
Mischief-makers who are all but a stain
on the history of the royal family.

296
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,115
Do you know who this is referring to?

297
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,994
It is what the people of the palace
whisper about the lot of you.

298
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,123
Are you not ashamed?

299
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:01,463
You seem to be very ashamed
of us good-for-nothing mischief-makers.

300
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,509
That is not the point.

301
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,222
I am suggesting that you restore
your tarnished reputation.

302
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:11,848
I am sorry.

303
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,142
We seemed to have missed the point again.

304
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,187
But what can we do?

305
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,356
We are all but a stain.

306
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,332
If the Crown Prince
fails to overcome this crisis,

307
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,836
the lives of the Grand Princes
will be endangered just for being my sons.

308
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,757
How could they be so oblivious?

309
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,178
Why not tell them about
the condition of the Crown Prince?

310
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,182
They are emotional and affectionate.

311
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,935
Even if I ask them to be discreet,

312
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:02,315
they will visit the quarters of the
Crown Prince day and night out of worry

313
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,359
and end up revealing his condition.

314
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,987
For now,

315
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,616
the best course of action
would be to keep myself focused

316
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,786
on tutoring the Grand Prince
who shows the most promise.

317
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,996
Your Majesty.

318
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,956
Why not ask Lord Min Seung-yun

319
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,793
for an objective evaluation
of all the Grand Princes?

320
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,462
Ask him directly?

321
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,090
Yes. There may be a Grand Prince

322
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,427
who might be much more capable
than we are led to believe.

323
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,179
We should speak with Lord Min first

324
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,765
and then try to have as many of them
as we can partake in the selection.

325
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,185
You are right.

326
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,979
I will use the cohort selection
as an excuse

327
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,148
to get as many of them
as I can to read books.

328
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,236
Your Majesty, you already had one today.

329
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,459
Your Majesty, please wait for me.

330
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,129
It must be the herbal medicine
that has made her so speedy.

331
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,340
Your Majesty, please.

332
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,009
Do you see that?

333
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,386
She is without any grace and dignity.

334
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,556
One might even mistake her
for a martial arts master.

335
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,059
She must be the fastest in the palace.

336
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,646
And she is supposed to be the Queen?

337
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,813
What a disgrace.

338
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,190
Prince Uiseong.

339
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,363
Did I not say
that I might end up killing you

340
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,949
if you spoke such nonsense
like that again?

341
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,000
Go ahead and hit me then.

342
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,545
Those fools may not be able to hear me,

343
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,299
but they will surely
see you take a swing at me.

344
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,970
You should not call
the servants of the court such names.

345
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,889
Who cares? They are just
lowly servants who work under us.

346
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,393
Go ahead and hit me.

347
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,021
I would love to see if the Queen's
martial arts training has paid off.

348
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,739
She is the Mother of the Kingdom.

349
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,450
Treat her with respect
both in and out of her presence.

350
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,829
Grand Prince Seongnam.

351
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,206
You know what?

352
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,874
The title of Crown Prince

353
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,461
should have been mine, not your brother's.

354
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,464
You should stop before you regret it.

355
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,593
If I ever end up inheriting the throne,

356
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,472
I will not keep the likes of you alive,
even as peasants.

357
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,433
I would have you all killed.

358
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,939
Listen carefully.

359
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,983
The throne will be my brother's.

360
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,653
If a bastard like you becomes the King,

361
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,365
I will see to it personally

362
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,743
that your kingdom lies in ruins.

363
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,632
What…

364
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,344
did you just say?

365
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,764
Excuse my bluntness,

366
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,725
but none of them
have a chance at becoming a cohort.

367
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,811
It is not that they lack intelligence.

368
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,647
It is just that they are mostly
lacking in determination.

369
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,108
If the Office of Royal Genealogy hears
that a prince has neglected his studies,

370
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,487
their name is then passed on to
His Majesty at the end of the season

371
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,865
and that prince will be classified
as a delinquent and punished.

372
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,370
All the Grand Princes are in danger
of being classified as delinquents.

373
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:48,291
But especially
Grand Princes Seongnam and Gyeseong.

374
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,834
If they miss a few more lessons,

375
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,379
they will end up delinquents
due to their truancy

376
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,506
and be expelled from Jonghak.

377
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,049
Hold on a second.

378
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,428
I can see how
Grand Prince Seongnam might be at risk,

379
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,475
but Grand Prince Gyeseong too?

380
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,188
Delinquents?

381
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,816
This must be a misunderstanding.

382
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,527
I have checked many times.
It is Grand Prince Gyeseong.

383
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,323
What will happen if he is expelled
from Jonghak as a delinquent?

384
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,326
It will end up proving
how unfit he is for kingship.

385
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,705
But is he not the Grand Prince
that you count on the most?

386
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,207
He still is.

387
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,459
We know nothing for certain just yet.

388
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,171
He has not been classified as one yet.
It is a possibility that he might.

389
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,759
I doubt he will ever end up
causing any serious trouble.

390
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,221
Your Majesty.

391
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,183
Is that not Grand Prince Gyeseong
over there?

392
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,134
Where on earth did he go?

393
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,817
Your Majesty.

394
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,030
Your Majesty.

395
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,213
I looked everywhere for you.

396
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,593
I thought you had
run somewhere far off to hide.

397
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,556
But I find you hiding here again

398
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,642
as you always have.

399
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,030
No matter how hard I search,

400
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,826
there is no place in this palace…

401
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,455
where I can cry out loud.

402
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:20,178
Did you cry to your heart's content?

403
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,223
A little.

404
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,069
Did you see that?

405
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,364
Yes.

406
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,460
So I was not seeing things.

407
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,632
What do I do now?

408
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,509
If someone else finds out,

409
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,471
that will be the end
of Grand Prince Gyeseong.

410
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,225
What should I do?

411
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,101
Your Majesty.

412
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,188
You should stop telling me your secrets.

413
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,816
But who else would I tell such things?

414
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,909
I had no one to turn to when I entered
the palace at such a young age.

415
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,956
I do not care if you serve
the Queen Dowager or anyone else.

416
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:35,253
You are the only person that I have.

417
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,006
What…

418
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,426
What am I to do now?

419
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,972
What will I do…

420
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,893
with my dear Hwan?

421
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,540
Do you wish to partake?

422
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,792
Master.

423
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,423
I did not come here for the fear
of being scolded by Mother.

424
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,803
But I am standing
at a crossroads right now.

425
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,017
I am asking you this in an attempt
to protect my honor as a Grand Prince.

426
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,355
Must you really
reveal the results of the exam?

427
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,524
I shall ask.

428
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,781
Then I would like to partake
in the cohort selection.

429
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,493
GRAND PRINCE MUAN

430
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,083
PRINCE BOGEOM

431
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,377
PRINCE UISEONG

432
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,337
PRINCE SIMSO

433
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,964
PRINCE YEONGMIN

434
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,468
PRINCE HODONG

435
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,022
No.

436
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,191
I do not have time to waste.

437
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,277
The cohort selection will begin soon.

438
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,654
I should go and check on
Grand Prince Gyeseong.

439
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,614
Your Majesty.

440
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,700
Do you intend to have him
partake in the exam?

441
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,330
What do you expect me to do?

442
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:38,042
I cannot just give up on him
just because I now know everything.

443
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,920
He is the only Grand Prince
who volunteered,

444
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,838
so how could I give up on him?

445
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,425
Perhaps the other Grand Princes
will apply as well.

446
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,261
Then I would be ever so grateful.

447
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,306
But did you not see that day?

448
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,475
When I brought it up with them,

449
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,020
they asked to be married
so they may leave the palace.

450
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,739
Give it some thought then!

451
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,699
Although I scold you
whenever you cause trouble,

452
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,537
have I ever nagged you to study?

453
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,799
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM

454
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,975
Have you completed the list?

455
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,060
Almost.

456
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,147
I will deliver it to His Majesty
as soon as you are done.

457
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,400
There is still half an hour left,

458
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,153
so why not take a seat while you wait?

459
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,615
If anyone has not submitted
their nameplates by now,

460
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,701
they surely do not intend to partake.

461
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,661
We must still abide by the rules.

462
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,582
I shall hand over the list
in half an hour.

463
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,667
I see. Yes.

464
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,711
As you wish.

465
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,147
Your Highness.
The Crown Prince wishes to see you.

466
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,025
Right now?

467
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,610
-Over here!
-Where are you?

468
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,111
-Over here!
-Where?

469
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,280
Where are you?

470
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,783
He has grown so big.

471
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,203
I hear he is already
in the Office of Early Education.

472
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,371
-He is giving his master a handful.
-Where are you?

473
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,207
-Over here!
-There you are!

474
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,626
He has no problems
understanding his tutor…

475
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,127
-Over here!
-…but never does as he is told.

476
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,337
Here!

477
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,131
-Where are you?
-Look how full of life he is.

478
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,301
He seems to take more after you than me.

479
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,972
Kang.

480
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,225
Do you remember our days in Seochon?

481
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,979
There was nothing I enjoyed more
than visiting you there.

482
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,906
I do miss those days sometimes.

483
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,410
When you returned
to the palace from Seochon,

484
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,706
I was happy as it felt like my younger
brothers had gotten a new older brother.

485
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,501
I was relieved

486
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,255
to know that you would have their backs
even when I am gone.

487
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,179
Could I ask you to do
the same for my son too?

488
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,808
Make sure he works hard
on the things he needs to do

489
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,520
and that he is not tempted
by the things he should keep away from.

490
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:48,315
Scold him if he drinks
or causes any trouble.

491
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,903
I want you to be like a father to him

492
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,489
as well as a friend.

493
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,786
Why do you say such things
as if you will be going away somewhere?

494
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,296
Will you keep me company as my cohort?

495
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,342
I miss the time we spent
in Seochon together.

496
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,490
Who are you?

497
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,494
Who said you could enter my house?

498
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,621
I am your brother.

499
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,290
Says who?

500
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,291
I do.

501
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,296
Brother. Are you good at fighting?

502
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,012
Brother, it is them!

503
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,609
-What do you want?
-I have a brother too!

504
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,818
Whatever.

505
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,320
You are dead meat.

506
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,323
My brother is an excellent fighter.

507
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,328
Come on, Brother.

508
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,841
You said you were good at fighting.

509
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,055
But why is your nose still bleeding?

510
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,434
You lose if you bleed from the nose.

511
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:48,977
It is okay.

512
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,731
We will land at least one punch
the next time we fight.

513
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,406
Take that!

514
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,755
I could not have been happier

515
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,592
when you returned
to the palace to live with us.

516
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,569
Well, it is time. Please hand me the list.

517
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,337
Master, am I too late?

518
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,965
Applications are still open.

519
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,559
Then I would like to apply.

520
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,354
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM

521
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,648
I knew you would come.

522
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,447
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM

523
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,287
Your Majesty.

524
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,998
All of the Grand Princes have applied.

525
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,293
What?

526
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,961
All of the Grand Princes?

527
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,713
-All of them?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

528
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,925
Even Grand Princes Seongnam and Muan?

529
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,470
Yes. All of them have applied
to partake in the cohort selection.

530
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,513
My goodness.

531
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:52,643
How could they surprise
their mother like this?

532
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,022
Court Lady Shin.

533
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,857
Let us begin the preparations.

534
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,195
Your Majesty.

535
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,988
This is great news.

536
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,158
-It is indeed.
-I am so relieved.

537
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,376
I did not expect such great interest
in the cohort selection.

538
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,339
Is there a reason you wish to select
the new cohort through an examination?

539
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:27,094
The Crown Prince is bright in academics,
but he is much too upright.

540
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,889
I want him to twist, turn, and break
outside the box from time to time.

541
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:35,602
Therefore, I intend to select
a prince whose perspective

542
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,897
differs much from the Crown Prince.

543
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,062
I am your arithmetic tutor, Park Chi-un.

544
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,191
He was not satisfied
with his previous arithmetic tutor,

545
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,110
so I have brought someone new.

546
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,195
Is he qualified?

547
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,657
He came in first place
in the arithmetic examination.

548
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,285
He is second to none
when it comes to arithmetic.

549
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,288
Prince Uiseong

550
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,790
must make a strong impression
in the first two exams.

551
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,792
You can rest assured.

552
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,880
The literary exams will be only on
Jungyong and Seogyeong,

553
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:49,051
and I will teach him
only the lines that he will be tested on.

554
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:59,269
You must memorize everything up to here.

555
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:03,065
In Jungyong, you must make sure
to study Chapter 21,

556
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:07,194
"On Enlightenment Through Sincerity."

557
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,126
I have brought

558
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,463
all the textbooks used at Jonghak
and Sigangwon as you ordered.

559
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,257
I see. Well done.

560
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,181
Your Majesty.

561
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,727
Do you intend to read all these books?

562
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,188
I will not be able to
help the Grand Princes

563
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,108
unless I know what they will be tested on.

564
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,446
If you are asked how one should
go about putting men in office,

565
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,407
what would your answer be?

566
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,625
May we take a break?

567
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,046
I did not arrange
a private lesson with the top student

568
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,841
from Sungkyunkwan,
the Royal Confucian Academy,

569
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,301
just so that he could watch you doze off.

570
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,345
Mother, may I…

571
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,349
May I take a quick nap before we continue?

572
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,602
Do you know how much
this lesson costs per hour?

573
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:26,648
You have no idea how much it cost me
to convince him to come and tutor you.

574
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,986
Learn as much from him as you can
so that we get our money's worth.

575
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,030
I will.

576
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,869
You may continue.

577
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:43,498
In such a case, I should quote
Zi Lu's chapter of Noneo.

578
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,918
"The Master said, 'Raise to office
those whom you know--'"

579
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,172
Mother. My nose…

580
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,190
Please, continue.

581
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,316
Yes.

582
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,236
"He went on to say, 'As to those
whom you do not know,

583
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,905
will others neglect them?'"

584
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,632
EXPECTED QUESTIONS

585
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:26,393
Your Majesty, it is getting late.

586
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,020
Let me just finish this.

587
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,023
One would think you are the one
taking the examination.

588
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:38,405
The concubines even hired scribes
and private tutors to aid their sons.

589
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,448
-They did?
-Yes.

590
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,868
As the Queen,

591
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,704
I cannot stoop so low as to bring
learned academics as tutors.

592
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,541
What other option do I have
but to resort to gajeonggyohak?

593
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,210
GAJEONGGYOHAK: MODERN-DAY HOMESCHOOLING

594
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,927
Since you take herbal medicine
whenever you are under stress,

595
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,306
I am sure it will make you even healthier.

596
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,808
I need to stay strong.

597
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,477
Who else will protect my sons, if not me?

598
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,230
But you should not take
more than two pills a day.

599
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,065
We will see.

600
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,156
Court Lady Shin.

601
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,366
Yes, Your Majesty.

602
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,954
Do you know how
I came to be selected as the Queen?

603
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,542
You do not dare say it, do you?

604
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,963
I know. I have heard
the servants of the court gossip.

605
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,508
They say the late King selected me,
a woman of humble birth,

606
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,011
to keep his maternal relatives in check.

607
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,013
But I will tell you what.

608
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,806
That was not it.

609
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,731
It was because my abilities surpassed
all the other candidates.

610
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,318
If I lose…

611
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,154
I cannot sleep.

612
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,216
I will see you again next time.

613
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,469
Yes, Your Highness.

614
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,763
Hurry and leave before someone sees you.

615
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,146
-You startled me.
-Pardon me, Your Highness.

616
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,733
Did you look into it?

617
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,027
-Did you find out anything?
-Yes.

618
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,864
Grand Prince Gyeseong has been secretly
going somewhere as you expected.

619
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,492
Is that right?

620
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,453
Although she pretends not to care,

621
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,039
I know that Her Majesty
would not be standing by idly.

622
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,792
Could she have hired a scribe?

623
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,671
I have not found out that much yet.

624
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,673
Then what is it that you found out?

625
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:07,387
I know where the Grand Prince
goes and at what time.

626
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,472
I see.

627
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:14,978
I wonder who this scribe that Her Majesty
has gone so far as to hire is.

628
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,902
How can there be no medical records left?

629
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:27,157
The only record I could find regarding
Crown Prince Taein was a single line

630
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,159
stating that His Majesty passed
from hyeolheogwol.

631
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,286
It was the Crown Prince who died.

632
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,914
How can there be no other
records regarding this death?

633
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,793
All the records were lost in a fire
that swept the Royal Clinic.

634
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,173
A fire?

635
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,640
There still must be someone
who remembers what happened.

636
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,393
I asked around,

637
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,645
but no one seemed
to remember what happened.

638
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,649
What do you mean?

639
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,818
Some died in the fire,

640
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:07,739
and the surviving physicians
all left the palace afterward.

641
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:13,161
Then there is not a single physician
in the palace who knows what happened

642
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,246
except for Royal Physician Cho Guk-yeong?

643
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,957
Yes, Your Majesty.

644
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,964
The fire alone is enough
to raise suspicion,

645
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:29,010
so how is it that no physician
from then is still at the palace?

646
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,388
-How does that make sense?
-Your Majesty.

647
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,308
That is all I could learn.

648
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,191
Then who was the physician

649
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,152
who treated Crown Prince Taein?

650
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,159
It was Lord Yoo Sang-uk.

651
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,036
Yoo Sang-uk?

652
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:00,125
Court Lady Oh, ask around
about the whereabouts of Yoo Sang-uk.

653
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,126
Yes, Your Majesty.

654
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,129
It will not be easy to find him.

655
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,881
He is said to be missing.

656
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,718
His relatives and acquaintances
must know something.

657
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,096
-Hurry.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

658
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,309
Summon the Grand Princes.

659
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,186
Yes, Your Majesty.

660
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,957
Mother, what are all these books?

661
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,793
These are the books you will be studying.

662
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,589
Do not be startled.

663
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,258
I picked out the questions
that are likely to be on the exam,

664
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,801
so focus on them for now.

665
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,854
Who picked these questions out?

666
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,522
I did.

667
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,900
-No way.
-No way.

668
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,237
Do you not believe me?

669
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,490
It is not that we do not believe you,

670
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,783
but it is just that it is hard to believe.

671
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,328
I had students at Sungkyunkwan review it,

672
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,829
so begin studying them first.

673
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:25,126
I will also bring you more questions later
that may not have been covered here.

674
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,211
Mother.

675
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,714
Have you always been
this passionate about our education?

676
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,926
Of course. I have always been competitive.

677
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,762
All right. The exam is in two days.

678
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,598
I just want one of you to become
the cohort of the Crown Prince.

679
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,724
I see.

680
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,268
As you well know, Mother,

681
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,437
it will be fine as long as
he manages to keep up.

682
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,948
I will not repeat myself,
so listen carefully.

683
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:55,990
Focus.

684
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,996
There are five grades
that you can receive in this exam.

685
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,542
"Tong" means you did an exceptional job.

686
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,710
"Yak" means you did okay,
"Jo" means you need to do better,

687
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,338
and "bul" means that you failed.

688
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,092
Lastly, there is "bangoe,"

689
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,637
meaning you do not deserve
to be graded at all.

690
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,764
-It is the worst grade then.
-Exactly.

691
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:23,810
You never used to care
even if we got bad grades.

692
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,229
There is nothing good
about being a prince.

693
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,772
It just ends up tying you down.

694
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,650
You cannot always get what you want.

695
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,027
At least not while you are in the palace.

696
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,448
Mother.

697
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,119
Must one of us really go on
to become the cohort of the Crown Prince?

698
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,499
You must prepare yourself.

699
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:51,713
If you fail to do so,
you risk not only losing the Crown Prince

700
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:56,384
but also the lives
of the other Grand Princes.

701
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:57,802
Yes.

702
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,598
Is there a problem?

703
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,985
Mother.

704
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,070
We are terrible students.

705
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,905
We are the worst students at Jonghak.

706
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,408
So you should let go of false hopes
and be content

707
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,619
that we even applied
for the cohort selection.

708
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,495
-That way, you will be able to--
-Have you ever tried?

709
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,290
You can worry about that after you try!

710
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,628
And while we are on the subject,

711
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:37,925
you will also have to keep up
with your studies at Jonghak from now on.

712
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,639
You have changed.

713
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,767
What has gotten into you?

714
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,103
I do not want to lose.

715
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:53,524
Even mere concubines are actively involved
in their children's education at Jonghak.

716
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,527
I also have my pride to protect.

717
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,279
I…

718
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,656
am the Queen!

719
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,785
Also…

720
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,331
you will all leave the palace
once you get married.

721
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,460
Mother.

722
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,921
Then does that mean

723
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:19,300
we will be married sooner
if we do as you say?

724
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,263
Yes.

725
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,475
So before you leave the palace,

726
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,436
feel free to make your mother proud.

727
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:37,860
You never know…

728
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,615
what will happen in the palace.

729
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:44,992
Therefore,

730
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,161
I would like to be able to…

731
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,832
lay my hopes on you.

732
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,293
So please…

733
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,299
be on your best behavior
while you are still in the palace.

734
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,234
I am fine with all of this,

735
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,990
but I fear that you may hurt the other
Grand Princes by giving them false hope.

736
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,869
It may be more meaningful
to accept things as they are

737
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,204
and live to the best of one's abilities.

738
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,878
I am not giving them false hope.

739
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,924
I cannot let you know why just yet,

740
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,761
but this is a decision I made…

741
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,681
to protect all of you.

742
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,492
The Crown Prince has just
finished his jugang.

743
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,951
JUGANG: DAYTIME LESSON AT SIGANGWON

744
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,245
Will he be fine to continue
with his schedule?

745
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,956
Yes, Your Majesty.
He did not seem ill at all.

746
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:19,170
You can stop watching him
at Sigangwon for the time being.

747
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,715
We cannot let the others notice
I am keeping watch over him.

748
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,925
Yes, Your Majesty.

749
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:29,347
I hope the Grand Princes
do well on their first exam.

750
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,059
How is Grand Prince Gyeseong doing?

751
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,478
I saw him head to his quarters.

752
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,687
What do you mean?

753
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,066
You should have kept watch
until you saw him go in.

754
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,400
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

755
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,280
I should go and check his quarters.

756
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,325
I cannot believe Her Majesty.

757
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:35,288
She always told us to be calm
while keeping up appearances,

758
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,082
but she even found a place
for her son to study in secret.

759
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:17,223
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

760
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,790
Rumors are covered by rumors.

761
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:48,170
It might not simply end
with a cohort selection.

762
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,213
They are starting.

763
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,758
Are you confident
in making him the cohort?

764
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,595
It is time I face the true side
of Grand Prince Gyeseong.

765
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,016
What an unexpected change.

766
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,643
He must have been so scared.

767
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,980
I have done it once.
Who is to say I cannot do it again?

768
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:08,733
Starting from tomorrow,
the real battle begins.

769
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:13,404
