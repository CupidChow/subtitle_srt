1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,252
I hid it in the floor
of the archives of the Royal Clinic.

3
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,879
I have marked the place.

4
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,278
Are you looking for the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein?

5
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,291
Yes, I am.

6
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,044
What brings you here, Your Majesty?

7
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,382
You already know

8
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,012
why I am standing here before you.

9
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,268
I finally found out who killed my son.

10
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,397
Yi Ik-hyeon.

11
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,800
From becoming a physician

12
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,928
to entering the palace,

13
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,015
did you do all of that

14
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,060
to get revenge?

15
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,188
Revenge was not my initial plan.

16
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,360
At first, I simply wanted to find out
how my brother died.

17
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,655
Then when did all this start?

18
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,450
A long time ago.

19
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,246
A very long time ago.

20
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,669
What is it you want to know?

21
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,921
Everything.

22
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,885
Tell me everything you know
about my son who died painfully.

23
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,972
Why did it have to be him?

24
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,474
Why?

25
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,520
Why did it have to be him, of all people?

26
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,400
When I found out he was
suffering from hyeolheogwol,

27
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,153
I thought it was destiny.

28
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,156
It was my chance

29
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,784
to learn how my brother died through him.

30
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,203
Are you saying

31
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,207
you killed my son

32
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,252
in the same way
Crown Prince Taein was killed?

33
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,172
I would have been caught right away
if that was the case.

34
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,135
I inserted a needle into his gimunhyeol
to cause his organs to bleed.

35
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,557
Then I repeatedly gave him a small amount
of gansu, salty and bitter water.

36
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,895
In the end, he died
after I stopped treating him.

37
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,984
I trusted you

38
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,613
with the life of my son.

39
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,908
So how could you…

40
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,035
How could you…

41
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,581
How dare you…

42
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:15,380
How could you dare kill
my child right under my nose?

43
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,675
My mother lost four of her children!

44
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,683
Seeing you in this state

45
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,728
reminds me

46
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,692
of how my mother grieved
over her innocent children.

47
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,947
I sincerely apologize

48
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,325
for taking the life

49
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,162
of the innocent late Crown Prince.

50
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,499
But do not forget

51
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,377
none of this would have happened

52
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,005
if the current king
had not usurped the throne.

53
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,720
As my brothers were killed one by one,

54
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,763
I lived

55
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,268
in constant fear
that it could be my turn at any moment.

56
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,022
You will never understand

57
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,358
the excruciating pain.

58
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,946
I was simply trying to get my revenge.

59
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,281
Shut your mouth.

60
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,330
You can claim all you want

61
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:36,461
that your fear and pain
justify your revenge,

62
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,463
but you are

63
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,009
nothing but a murderer
who killed my innocent son.

64
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,887
He did not deserve

65
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,308
to be brought down by someone like you.

66
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,605
He did not have

67
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,734
anything to do with your grudges!

68
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,988
Then what did my brothers do
to deserve to be killed?

69
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,201
As I watched my mother

70
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,707
bury the bloody bodies of her sons
holding back her tears of blood,

71
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,459
I swore to myself

72
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,755
I would find out
what caused my brother to die

73
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,216
and put everything in its rightful place.

74
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,139
The death of the Crown Prince
is only the beginning, Your Majesty.

75
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,601
I will never…

76
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,522
let that happen.

77
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,818
I will

78
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,238
put an end to everything.

79
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,075
I will make sure

80
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,452
that you, Yi Ik-hyeon,

81
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,791
pay for taking the life of my son.

82
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,642
-That way! Get him!
-Yes, sir!

83
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,163
There is not long until the rebellion.

84
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,748
As soon as His Highness finds
evidence of poisoning,

85
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,292
we will take action.

86
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,420
So be sure to check
where each of you must be again.

87
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,512
Arrest all of them!

88
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,975
Darn it.

89
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,660
Why are you telling me this now?

90
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,829
I have been suspicious of Physician Kwon,

91
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,165
but I did not know he was Yi Ik-hyeon

92
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,083
until today.

93
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,964
Do you have evidence
that he murdered the late Crown Prince?

94
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:27,965
Yes.

95
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,303
I have evidence
that he used gansu to kill him.

96
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,806
All we need now is his confession.

97
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,726
If what you say is true,

98
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,895
I will make him pay at any cost.

99
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,063
However,

100
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,107
he is a mere physician
who killed the Crown Prince.

101
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,694
A mere physician?

102
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,657
He is Grand Prince Yeongwon, Yi Ik-hyeon,
who pretended to be a physician.

103
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,117
No. He is not Yi Ik-hyeon.

104
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,662
The man who is living
with the deposed Queen Yoon

105
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,247
is Yi Ik-hyeon.

106
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:04,961
Your Majesty.

107
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,632
Who has the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein now?

108
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,829
How could you lose him in the palace?

109
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,081
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

110
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,002
He could not have gone far.

111
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,754
Find him at any cost.

112
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,755
Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,514
Search thoroughly!

114
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,515
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

115
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,735
No one is here!

116
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,030
The deposed queen has fled.
Search the area!

117
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,446
Who is there?

118
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,949
Reveal yourself.

119
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,921
How dare you?

120
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,132
You are a rebel
pursued by the palace guards.

121
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,467
How dare you show up here?

122
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,554
If you report me,

123
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,267
I will inform His Majesty
that you have been plotting treason.

124
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,569
His Majesty is in pursuit
of Physician Kwon?

125
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,737
Yes.

126
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,365
Their base in Seochon
was attacked last night,

127
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,617
and they were all arrested.

128
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,079
Prince Uiseong was lucky
to avoid being arrested with them.

129
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,042
Tell him to remain
in his residence for now.

130
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,587
And if you hear any news
about Physician Kwon,

131
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,548
please let me know.

132
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,598
You want my help?

133
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,271
Would it not be safer
for me to withdraw now?

134
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,314
We still have a chance.

135
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,109
I will reveal to the world
what the King did,

136
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,236
which will undermine his authority.

137
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,239
Then the autopsy report
will strengthen the legitimacy

138
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,700
of Grand Prince Yeongwon,
the brother of Crown Prince Taein.

139
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,828
And then?

140
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,997
We will crown a new king.

141
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,623
The new Crown Prince

142
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,917
will be you, as promised.

143
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,587
Is that right?

144
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,882
Can I see that autopsy report?

145
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,020
Physician Kwon.

146
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,024
Are you looking for the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein?

147
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,818
It is definitely inside the palace.

148
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,114
So we have no chance without it, do we?

149
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,908
I will find it no matter what.

150
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,618
All you need to do

151
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,996
is help me sneak into the palace.

152
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,880
Why did you not tell Father?

153
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,426
His Majesty must not know
where this autopsy report is.

154
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:27,181
That way, he will keep
Physician Kwon alive to find it.

155
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,475
By the way,

156
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,852
how is this in your hands?

157
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,526
I found out who recorded this.

158
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,249
Do you know where the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein is?

159
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,423
No, Your Majesty.

160
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,134
Is that so?

161
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,806
As you are the one who recorded it,

162
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,599
I assumed

163
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,980
you would know where it is.

164
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,820
Why…

165
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,198
are you looking for it, Your Majesty?

166
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,833
The death of the late Crown Prince
seems to resemble

167
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,169
that of Crown Prince Taein greatly.

168
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,756
So I think

169
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,926
the autopsy report

170
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,472
might help me reveal
how the Crown Prince really died.

171
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,354
By the way,

172
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,692
I heard the Queen Dowager

173
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,195
is in search of it as well.

174
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,378
If that autopsy report

175
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,506
was what had kept him alive,

176
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:29,386
I was certain he would want to check
if it was where he had hidden it.

177
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,385
And

178
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,638
the person who needs this
most desperately right now

179
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,722
is Physician Kwon.

180
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,474
No,

181
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,477
I mean Yi Ik-hyeon.

182
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,480
He has waited 20 years.

183
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,233
He will not give up like this.

184
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,944
Therefore,

185
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,491
when he finds out that I have the report,

186
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,579
I am sure he will come to see me.

187
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,811
It has been a while,

188
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,229
Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk.

189
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,529
It has been a very long time indeed,

190
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,323
Prince Geumyeong.

191
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,911
If you want to live,

192
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,956
tell me where Yi Ik-hyeon is.

193
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,420
If I were going
to beg you to spare my life,

194
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,672
I would not have started this.

195
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,008
What did you see
during the autopsy that day

196
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,176
that made you do this?

197
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,055
You should know the answer
better than anyone.

198
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,182
You saw everything, did you not?

199
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,442
So please,

200
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,695
tell me what happened that day.

201
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,572
I have only endured all these years

202
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,366
so that I could someday dig out the truth.

203
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,702
So tell me.

204
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,454
Please.

205
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,083
Tell me how you poisoned

206
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,627
-Crown Prince Taein to death!
-Shut your mouth!

207
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,298
Am I the one who killed him?

208
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,512
Fine, I did look the other way.

209
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,224
Knowing my mother was killing him,

210
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,433
I pretended not to know.

211
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,144
But there was nothing I could do anyway.

212
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,187
No.

213
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,108
It is your greed that killed him.

214
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,322
Therefore,

215
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,035
you will never be free from that day
for the rest of your life.

216
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,334
For 20 whole years,

217
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,421
the death of my brother has held me back.

218
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,758
It made me work harder, and I managed
to make a prosperous kingdom!

219
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,012
I did all that to prove
that I deserved the throne.

220
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,347
"Prosperous kingdom"?

221
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,017
You live in anxiety,
surrounded by evil enemies.

222
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,602
Do you call that prosperous?

223
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,354
You deserved the throne?

224
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,941
Will you be able to say that
when it is revealed

225
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,985
that Crown Prince Taein was poisoned?

226
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,825
How do you think
history will remember you?

227
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,911
This is probably

228
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,998
how you will be remembered.

229
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,876
"Prince Geumyeong,

230
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,838
the traitor who usurped the throne."

231
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,849
Find the autopsy report
as soon as Physician Kwon is arrested.

232
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,268
And once you have the autopsy report,

233
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,939
kill him immediately.

234
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,027
Is Physician Kwon still missing?

235
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,944
Yes.

236
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,779
They searched the capital thoroughly,

237
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,365
but they have not found any trace.

238
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,455
Your Majesty.

239
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,666
His Majesty ordered
that Physician Kwon be killed

240
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,376
as soon as he is arrested.

241
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,378
What?

242
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,549
We need his confession to bring
the Grand Heir back to the palace.

243
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,510
We must find him before Father does.

244
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,304
Not just His Majesty.

245
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,932
Once his identity

246
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,351
comes to light,

247
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,896
the Queen Dowager
will try to kill him as well.

248
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,662
You must already know Royal Physician Cho
was poisoned to death by gansu.

249
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,121
I do.

250
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,499
Nothing that happens in the palace

251
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,377
ever gets past me.

252
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,753
In that case,

253
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,048
do you perhaps know
who killed him as well?

254
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,636
It was Physician Kwon.

255
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,974
And he turns out to be

256
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,892
Yi Ik-hyeon.

257
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,229
Yi Ik-hyeon?

258
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,438
Yes.

259
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,942
He is Grand Prince Yeongwon,
the brother of Crown Prince Taein,

260
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,986
who you have kept alive.

261
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,613
How…

262
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,327
How can Physician Kwon be him?

263
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,581
Then who is the man
living with the deposed queen?

264
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,292
He is an imposter.

265
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,753
You have been deceived
by the deposed queen.

266
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,388
Now that Yi Ik-hyeon killed Cho Guk-yeong,

267
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,141
who do you think

268
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,269
will be next?

269
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,356
It will probably be

270
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,984
the person who ordered Cho Guk-yeong

271
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,154
to kill Crown Prince Taein.

272
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,197
Why are you

273
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,910
so obsessed with the death
of Crown Prince Taein?

274
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,040
I need to find out the truth of it

275
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,252
so that I can find out the truth
of the death of my son.

276
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,423
Therefore,

277
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,261
I plan to reveal the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein.

278
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,890
It has already

279
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,434
come into my possession.

280
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,939
Are you out of your mind?

281
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,611
What is it that you want?

282
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,698
I want you to find Physician Kwon
before His Majesty does.

283
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,950
If you do,

284
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,663
I will hand over
the autopsy report to you.

285
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,293
But remember this.

286
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,340
You have to bring him to me alive.

287
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,281
Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

288
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,533
Bring the man

289
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,328
who has been following
Prince Uiseong around right now.

290
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,418
Your Majesty.

291
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,254
The Crown Princess collapsed.

292
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,339
-The Crown Princess?
-Yes.

293
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,311
Why did she collapse?

294
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,565
Is there something wrong with her?

295
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,156
With all due respect,

296
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,076
I am having trouble checking her pulse.

297
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,203
What do you mean?

298
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,664
Your Majesty.

299
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:22,919
Her Royal Highness
has a slower pulse than normal.

300
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,217
Thump.

301
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,719
Thump.

302
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,181
This is the usual speed of my heartbeat.

303
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,517
But whenever I see you…

304
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,560
Thump, thump.

305
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,978
Thump, thump.

306
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,189
It beats normally.

307
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,816
It means I like you.

308
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,742
She is pregnant.

309
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,536
Did you just say

310
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,747
she is pregnant?

311
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,665
Yes.

312
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:05,086
The pulse feels smooth
and disperses when pressed.

313
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,464
I am sure she is pregnant.

314
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,591
Congratulations, Your Royal Highness.

315
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,518
Congratulations, Crown Prince.

316
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,438
I feel especially grateful
for this great news

317
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,608
after the unfortunate events
that happened in the palace recently.

318
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,446
Crown Prince.

319
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,575
Leave the matter
regarding your brother to me.

320
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,244
No.

321
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,746
I will continue to assist you.

322
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,208
It would be more helpful if you fulfilled
your duties as the Crown Prince.

323
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,377
I will let you know if I need help.

324
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,713
So focus on looking after
the Crown Princess for now.

325
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,968
She must feel confused
due to the unexpected pregnancy.

326
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,512
It must be even harder for her
because she is unwell.

327
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,431
You should stay by her side
at times like this.

328
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,359
The Crown Princess is pregnant.

329
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,486
Really?

330
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,697
-She is with child?
-Is it certain?

331
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,991
Yes. A royal physician
just checked her pulse.

332
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,409
Oh, my goodness.

333
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,662
This will give
the Crown Prince a foothold.

334
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,833
Exactly. If a son is born,
he will have nothing to worry about.

335
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,501
That is right.

336
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:33,091
Why does Consort Hwang
want to have tea with us all of a sudden?

337
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,260
I have no idea.
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

338
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:40,015
Could it be that she has not given up
on making her son the Crown Prince?

339
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,225
The Crown Prince defeated
all his competitors.

340
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,853
It would be shameless of her
if she has not given up.

341
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,730
Goodness gracious.

342
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,773
The Crown Princess is pregnant.

343
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,818
After all the commotion,

344
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,404
I am relieved
the Crown Prince is producing an heir.

345
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,365
Her Majesty must be so relieved.

346
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,953
Should we go and congratulate Her Majesty?

347
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,747
Let us hurry.

348
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,868
You have woken up.

349
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,828
Are you feeling better?

350
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,372
Yes.

351
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,086
What are those?

352
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:57,634
They are paintings that His Majesty sent
for the development of the unborn baby.

353
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,220
An unborn baby?

354
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,263
Is someone pregnant?

355
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,015
You are, Your Royal Highness.

356
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,478
-Me?
-Yes.

357
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,480
You are carrying a child.

358
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,815
How? When?

359
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,274
I guess it was the day

360
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,569
you consummated your marriage
after the nursemaid awoke your instincts.

361
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,534
All you have to do

362
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,871
is provide me with information
about Physician Kwon.

363
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,540
Your Royal Highness.

364
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,208
I am afraid I cannot do that.

365
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,086
It is not under my jurisdiction,

366
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,672
and even if I do know something,

367
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,092
I should not
leak such information personally.

368
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,178
So that was it.

369
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,389
When I heard you called for me,

370
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,018
I thought you wanted to congratulate me
on the pregnancy of the Crown Princess.

371
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,938
Her pregnancy

372
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:56,443
seems to have changed
your status dramatically as well.

373
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,239
Now that the Crown Prince
has gained a foothold,

374
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,286
I reckon many things will change
from now on.

375
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,749
Your Royal Highness.

376
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,001
If you have nothing else to say,

377
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,378
I will take my leave.

378
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,317
Your Royal Highness.

379
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,279
It seems Physician Kwon is hiding
in the residence of Prince Uiseong.

380
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,822
Is that right?

381
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,949
I will have them arrest him immediately.

382
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,242
No.

383
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,288
If we move rashly, he might flee.

384
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,459
I cannot hand him over
to the Queen so easily.

385
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,086
I will make sure

386
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,841
they suffer before they get killed.

387
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,973
Seeing that you know such a small gate,

388
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,059
you must know your way around the palace.

389
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,855
I used to play with my brothers
near the gate as a child.

390
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,065
Its humble appearance

391
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:21,194
makes it hard to believe
that it leads to the palace.

392
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,742
Do you have a family?

393
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,166
Yes.

394
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,335
I have an old mother and a son.

395
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,754
What about your wife?

396
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,048
I never got married.

397
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,635
Then who gave birth to your son?

398
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,267
She is with another man now.

399
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,398
Did you love her?

400
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:09,909
We may have lived
as an ordinary married couple

401
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,664
if we had not met the way we did.

402
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,842
When I ascend the throne,
I will grant you a wish.

403
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,886
Tell me what you want.

404
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,181
There is a house
where I lived with my brothers.

405
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,225
I want to reclaim it for my mother.

406
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,269
And I want to live there with her…

407
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,816
and my son.

408
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,737
That is my wish.

409
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,331
By the way,

410
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,374
when will the rebellion be?

411
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,463
It will take place
when the palace is most peaceful

412
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,549
and His Majesty is off guard.

413
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,395
"The plum blossoms
are bright and radiant."

414
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,024
"They look like waves in the moonlight."

415
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,903
"Adorned with white frost and snow,

416
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,822
the icy flowers…"

417
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,824
His Royal Highness
has always been brusque.

418
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,784
He likes meat.

419
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,327
No,

420
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,080
he likes greens
such as bracken and bean sprouts.

421
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,792
He is more warmhearted
than any of his brothers.

422
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,588
GIVING BIRTH TO SEVEN CHILDREN
THAT TAKE AFTER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS

423
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,719
Looking around the palace
holding his hand.

424
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,762
Taking a stroll with him.

425
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,348
Eating and chatting with him.

426
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,392
Wishing upon a shooting star with him.

427
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,481
When will His Royal Highness
open his heart to me?

428
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,193
Were you afraid you spent the night
with a woman you do not love?

429
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:53,364
I also do not want to be with someone
who dislikes me.

430
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,841
Your Majesty.

431
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,885
Since you have your plate full,

432
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,845
leave the Crown Princess to us.

433
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,929
Yes, Your Majesty.

434
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,557
We will take good care of her.

435
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,770
I appreciate the gesture,
but I must decline.

436
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,606
Please do not be like that, Your Majesty.

437
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,858
We would love to do something for you.

438
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,277
She is still in the early stages
of pregnancy.

439
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,945
She needs complete rest.

440
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,906
I know that,

441
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,576
but all the preparations
for pregnancy care are finished.

442
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,702
That is enough.

443
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,957
Since no pregnancy care is better
than physical and mental well-being,

444
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,086
make sure she can rest comfortably.

445
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,630
You should leave her alone.

446
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,632
Yes, Your Majesty.

447
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,927
But I have everything ready.

448
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,394
You broke your promise.

449
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,855
You said you would visit me often.

450
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,274
I am sorry.

451
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,961
I missed you,

452
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,506
Uncle.

453
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,564
What is this?

454
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,315
It is in return for the book.

455
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,865
I appreciate it, Uncle.

456
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,450
But next time,

457
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,494
please bring me Gyeokmongyogyeol.

458
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,039
You should be grateful
that I bring you one.

459
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,374
You are quite particular.

460
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,627
By the way, Uncle,

461
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,881
can I really move back home
when I turn nine?

462
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,301
My mother told me

463
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,805
that I can go back when I turn nine.

464
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,864
Really?

465
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,075
Are you sure?

466
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,578
You have to keep your promise.

467
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,829
I will.

468
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,813
I thought Her Royal Highness was pregnant.

469
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,106
I know.

470
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,609
Why is a pregnant woman running around?

471
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,611
This is not the first time.

472
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,280
I saw her running yesterday too.

473
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,823
Oh, my.

474
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,451
Could it be that
she is pretending to be pregnant?

475
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,590
Announce her arrival.

476
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,134
Now!

477
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,389
Your Majesty, the Queen Dowager is here.

478
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,310
What brings you here?

479
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,772
Rumor has it
that the Crown Princess is not pregnant.

480
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,691
I need to find out the truth.

481
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,905
Your Majesty.

482
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,408
The Crown Prince and Princess are here.

483
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,577
I summoned them here.

484
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,846
She is not pregnant.

485
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,349
What do you mean?

486
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,561
Why has your opinion changed
since your last examination?

487
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,271
With all due respect,

488
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,566
the Crown Princess has an unusual pulse,

489
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,818
and it seems to have led
to a misdiagnosis.

490
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,196
A misdiagnosis?

491
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,451
If what you say is false,

492
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,661
you will not be forgiven.

493
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,246
Your Majesty.

494
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,206
He is only human.

495
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,709
He can, of course, make mistakes.

496
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,419
By the way,

497
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,088
what do you mean,

498
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,632
the Crown Princess has an unusual pulse?

499
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,345
Her heart disease

500
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,848
makes it difficult
to check her pulse properly.

501
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,351
Heart disease?

502
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,734
How could you send your daughter
into the palace

503
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,694
when she was suffering from a disease?

504
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,239
It is true that she suffered
from heart disease as a child.

505
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:31,243
But the symptoms have improved
and do not affect her daily life anymore.

506
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,537
There is more.

507
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,540
I heard

508
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,585
all the matchmakers
have avoided setting her up.

509
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,838
If she is avoided even outside the palace,

510
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,508
she is certainly not qualified
to be the Crown Princess.

511
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,221
You knew everything
from the beginning, did you not?

512
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,099
During the selection,

513
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,519
you gave her the highest score
knowing all of that.

514
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,813
Was it your plan

515
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,440
to expel her like this

516
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,526
using her flaws as an excuse?

517
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,409
I was also well aware of her reputation.

518
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,701
Due to her free and easy character,

519
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,704
she had a bad reputation
among the matchmakers.

520
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,832
However,

521
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,961
that is exactly what made me
select her as the Crown Princess.

522
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,798
The Queen should be

523
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:29,176
someone bold and progressive.

524
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,182
Since her disease
seems to be nothing serious,

525
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,726
I will make sure she is treated.

526
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,520
So

527
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,899
I ask you not to raise
any further issues regarding her health.

528
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,569
You do not want me
to raise any further issues?

529
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,283
Heart disease affects fetal movement,

530
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,034
which may lead to a miscarriage.

531
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,121
Do you still say there is no problem?

532
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,416
I will take good care of her.

533
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,584
So

534
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:06,130
you should stop worrying about it now.

535
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,465
No.

536
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,216
I will inform His Majesty

537
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,594
and have her deposed.

538
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,678
Deposed?

539
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,972
The Crown Prince
is the heir to the throne.

540
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,142
If the Crown Princess
cannot produce healthy offspring,

541
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,186
she does not deserve the position.

542
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,860
Your Royal Highness!

543
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,617
Your Royal Highness.

544
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,503
Are you going this far

545
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,882
to acquire the autopsy report
of Crown Prince Taein?

546
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,051
Yes, that is correct.

547
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,136
Give me the report,

548
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,515
and I will keep the weaknesses
of the Crown Princess secret.

549
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,061
Give it some thought.

550
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,772
Between the autopsy report
and the Crown Princess,

551
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,775
what would you like to protect?

552
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,076
She is definitely pregnant.

553
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,578
If you want to live,

554
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,165
do not tell anyone that she is pregnant.

555
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,835
From now on,

556
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,421
you only have to do as I say.

557
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,154
Every day,

558
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:03,289
you pass by that place on your way
to your jugang, the daytime lesson.

559
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,836
I wanted to see you even from a distance.

560
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,299
And I could not hold back.

561
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,763
I think that is what started the rumor,

562
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,350
although I turned out
not to be pregnant after all.

563
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,145
I am relieved that you are not.

564
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:34,987
I heard pregnancy can be dangerous
for a woman with heart disease.

565
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,033
And it can be even worse after birth.

566
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,412
Do not let it concern you.

567
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,831
Nothing is more important

568
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,000
than your health.

569
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,462
Your Royal Highness.

570
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,975
We do not…

571
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,978
need to have a child.

572
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,532
Your Majesty.

573
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,079
The Queen Dowager beseeched His Majesty
to depose the Crown Princess

574
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,748
making an issue of her disease.

575
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,957
What?

576
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,181
This is unexpected.

577
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,685
I thought you would hold on to it
until the end.

578
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,939
I could not lose another Crown Princess.

579
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,942
You should give up now, Your Majesty.

580
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,944
Once Yi Ik-hyeon is dead,

581
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,446
everything will be over.

582
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,741
Do you think…

583
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,370
that is the only record from that day?

584
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,228
Hand over the gajangsacho,
the first draft, to me.

585
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,897
Are you going back on your word?

586
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,443
I only showed it to you
because you promised

587
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,945
not to tell anyone about its existence.

588
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,864
But Lord Park,

589
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,158
if we fail to find Yi Ik-hyeon,

590
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,160
the death of the late Crown Prince

591
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,413
will forever remain a mystery.

592
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,957
Lord Park.

593
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:57,045
The gajangsacho
is the only record left from that day.

594
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,260
With all due respect,

595
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,762
I cannot give it to you.

596
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,183
For I do not

597
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,351
have it any longer.

598
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,231
What…

599
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,277
do you mean by that?

600
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,414
You should get rid of it.

601
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,752
What did you just say?

602
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,087
I said you should

603
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,340
get rid of that gajangsacho.

604
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,261
If this record comes to light,

605
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,597
the dynasty will falter,

606
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,350
and the palace will be in chaos.

607
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:56,647
And its consequences
will be borne by the people.

608
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,613
If I get rid of this,

609
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,200
the record from that day

610
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,120
will be lost forever.

611
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,790
It is for the greater good.

612
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,125
So please do not hesitate.

613
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,701
Do you have anything on Physician Kwon?

614
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,786
I apologize.

615
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:56,290
We are searching by all possible means,
but we have not found any trace of him.

616
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:01,086
With both the autopsy report and
the gajangsacho gone, what shall we do?

617
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,218
Instead of Physician Kwon,
we should look for the deposed Queen Yoon.

618
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,597
He is a dutiful son.

619
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,308
I am sure he will visit his mother.

620
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,147
Search for Court Lady Jung,
who was expelled from the palace

621
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,733
along with Queen Yoon.

622
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,651
Yes, Your Majesty.

623
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,909
Why has Prince Uiseong

624
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,996
not reported Physician Kwon yet?

625
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,707
He must know

626
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,294
who his real father is.

627
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,049
How could you say something so absurd?

628
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,597
How disrespectful to the royal court.

629
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,600
Did you think your family would be safe

630
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,602
after turning Prince Uiseong,

631
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,022
the son of a lowly physician,
into royal blood?

632
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,442
Consort Hwang and Prince Uiseong

633
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,819
will face death.

634
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,782
Will you be able to prove it?

635
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,493
Nothing is true

636
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,287
unless it can be proven.

637
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,832
Chief State Councilor.

638
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,543
Did you forget

639
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,007
the family of the deposed queen
was accused of treason?

640
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,176
Evidence…

641
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,555
can always be created.

642
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,851
You have done it yourself.

643
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,479
However,

644
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,191
I intend to give you a way out.

645
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,278
Hand over…

646
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,573
Physician Kwon to me.

647
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,993
That is

648
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,457
the only way to save the lives

649
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,086
of Consort Hwang and Prince Uiseong.

650
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,853
We found the deposed Queen Yoon.

651
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,693
Where is Yi Ik-hyeon right now?

652
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,529
Why

653
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,782
should I tell you that?

654
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,952
Because if anyone else finds him first,
he will be killed.

655
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,998
You also

656
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,668
intend to do the same, do you not?

657
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,753
No.

658
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,297
I intend to spare his life.

659
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,508
I cannot find out

660
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,678
how the late Crown Prince died
without his confession.

661
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,183
So tell me.

662
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,435
Where is

663
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,812
Yi Ik-hyeon right now?

664
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,376
I will lure Physician Kwon

665
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,339
to the government offices
by haesi, the twenty-first hour.

666
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,467
Arrest him then, Your Majesty.

667
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,324
Wait here.

668
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,410
Those who will help you
will arrive at haesi.

669
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,499
There is no need to wait.

670
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,835
I can figure it out on my own.

671
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,003
What are you talking about?

672
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,256
What if you miss each other?

673
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,801
Then stay with me until they arrive.

674
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,725
By the way,

675
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:30,689
you are a mere physician.

676
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:35,777
So why do you risk your life
for Grand Prince Yeongwon?

677
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,738
What about you?

678
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,826
Why did you kill
the brothers of Crown Prince Taein?

679
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,630
I see people do not change.

680
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,050
Did you really expect me

681
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,387
to join you in that lousy rebellion?

682
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,476
Why did I kill his brothers?

683
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,605
It was to save my own skin. That is all.

684
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,941
Right.

685
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,026
So,

686
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,987
where is Grand Prince Yeongwon now?

687
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,199
If I tell you,

688
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,869
will you spare my life?

689
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,621
I will.

690
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,794
You can tell me.

691
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,636
You still have not found him?

692
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,394
Take one step closer,

693
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,355
and the Chief State Councilor will die.

694
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,148
Step back!

695
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,359
Put down your swords!

696
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,278
I said, step back!

697
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,409
Do you recognize me now?

698
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,453
Grand Prince Yeongwon…

699
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,746
Your Highness!

700
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,875
Your Highness.

701
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,877
You should run.

702
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,963
I will find you a hiding place.

703
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,633
You need to stay alive
to plan for the future.

704
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:30,642
I will not be able to leave
the palace alive anyway.

705
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,695
This is for taking the lives

706
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,947
of my brothers.

707
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,599
Mother.

708
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,268
The Chief State Councilor
has been murdered

709
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,271
while luring Physician Kwon
on His Majesty's orders.

710
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,817
Where is Physician Kwon now?

711
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,195
The guards are searching the palace,
but he has not been found yet.

712
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,449
He first killed Cho Guk-yeong

713
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,243
and then the Chief State Councilor.

714
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:36,332
His next target is the Queen Dowager.

715
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,651
In addition to killing my brother,
who was the Crown Prince,

716
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:08,323
you ordered the Chief State Councilor
to kill all my other brothers.

717
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,660
Following Crown Prince Taein,

718
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,246
my brothers were killed one by one.

719
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,167
I have chased your shadows ever since.

720
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,710
But for once,

721
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,798
I was ahead of you.

722
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,049
It was…

723
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,094
with Prince Uiseong.

724
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:35,475
I impregnated the concubine of your son
and made him raise my child as his own.

725
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:39,646
Your favorite grandson is my son!

726
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,731
How do you feel?

727
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,960
This chamber is surrounded.

728
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,171
You will not leave this place alive.

729
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,912
Are you really…

730
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,875
Yi Ik-hyeon?

731
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,307
Yes.

732
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,642
I am.

733
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,397
Did you intend to use me
from the beginning?

734
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,818
Did you ever think of me

735
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,489
as a woman even for a moment?

736
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,368
All I needed

737
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,247
was someone to takran my bloodline.

738
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,875
TAKRAN: TO LAY EGGS
IN THE NEST OF ANOTHER BIRD

739
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,371
It is over, Your Majesty.

740
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,418
Where is

741
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,088
Yi Ik-hyeon right now?

742
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,443
This is the blood
of the Chief State Councilor.

743
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,617
This is the blood of my father?

744
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,286
He should

745
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,206
pay for what he did, should he not?

746
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,586
No.

747
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,795
I do not believe it.

748
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,964
No!

749
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,258
Tell me it is not true.

750
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,512
Yi Ik-hyeon!

751
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,143
I am afraid I must kill you.

752
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,187
That is the only way

753
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,107
for me to live.

754
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,527
No…

755
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,059
I have failed,

756
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,436
but you must…

757
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,231
You must survive no matter what.

758
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,618
I am your father.

759
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,038
No…

760
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,459
You are…

761
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,128
You are…

762
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:22,178
the true heir to the throne.

763
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,146
Do you have a family?

764
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,194
Yes.

765
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,363
I have an old mother and a son.

766
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,622
When I ascend the throne,
I will grant you a wish.

767
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,291
Tell me what you want.

768
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,546
There is a house
where I lived with my brothers.

769
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,715
I want to reclaim it for my mother.

770
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,550
And I want to live there with her…

771
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,723
and my son.

772
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,601
That is my wish.

773
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,518
Yi Ik-hyeon

774
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,314
must have been killed by his son by now.

775
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,153
It is a shame that I could not witness it

776
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,197
with my own eyes.

777
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,417
Grandmother.

778
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,628
Rumor has it

779
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,214
that Physician Kwon coaxed you

780
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,634
into joining him in treason.

781
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,012
Physician Kwon

782
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,306
is Yi Ik-hyeon,

783
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,558
the leader of the rebels.

784
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:38,105
You still have a chance.

785
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,779
Kill Yi Ik-hyeon

786
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,783
with your own hands.

787
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,326
Only then,

788
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,705
will you be able to hide the fact

789
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,375
that you have been in collusion with him.

790
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:12,598
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

791
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,550
You are indebted to me.

792
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:50,261
You have the gajangsacho.

793
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,179
This will be your last chance

794
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,140
to reveal the truth.

795
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,018
What do you think I should do?

796
01:04:57,101 --> 01:05:00,938
I will sway the Queen
to bend the King's will.

797
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,690
You must cast them out from the palace.

798
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:06,027
It seems like the Crown Princess
has lost the fetus in her womb.

799
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,780
That is my way of protecting my son!

800
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:13,534
I will protect my husband in my own way.

801
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:20,249
