1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,096
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,099
Her Majesty has gone to her bedchamber.

4
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,782
Has His Majesty visited again?

5
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,367
Yes.

6
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,578
Ever since the funeral, he comes to see

7
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,039
if she has gone to bed
without missing a day.

8
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,750
His Majesty is quite incredible.

9
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,725
His Royal Highness
clearly coughed up blood before his death.

10
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,855
What have you done to His Royal Highness?

11
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,025
I know I am greatly guilty
for not curing his disease.

12
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,069
But it was not me.

13
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,822
Did I say that it was you?

14
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,577
I am telling you to expose
who was behind it if it was not you.

15
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,331
What on earth are you plotting?

16
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,514
Now,

17
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,309
tell me who was behind it.

18
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,527
EPISODE 6

19
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
Your Majesty.

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,629
Today we will not leave
before you make your decision.

21
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,547
You must come to a decision

22
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,925
and appoint the next Crown Prince.

23
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,637
The kingdom has fallen into a crisis.

24
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,765
Who do you reckon is worthy
to be the Crown Prince?

25
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,808
According to our law,

26
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,561
it should be His Highness the Grand Heir.

27
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,021
But he is still too young,

28
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,649
and he is yet to achieve
academic excellence.

29
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,526
Your Majesty, you have eleven princes.

30
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,321
Why not conduct the taekhyeon
and select one among them?

31
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,741
There is the son of the Crown Prince
and the Grand Princes. Taekhyeon?

32
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,618
I am proposing

33
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,829
we crown the wisest prince
regardless of his birth.

34
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,084
Just as when His Majesty
was crowned as the Crown Prince.

35
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,045
Since the reign of Your Majesty began,

36
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,673
the kingdom
has continuously lived in peace.

37
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,176
Do you not think the taekhyeon
is proven as a worthy method?

38
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,221
-We agree, Your Majesty.
-We agree, Your Majesty.

39
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,348
No, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,267
You must crown His Grand Heir

41
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,228
and establish the authenticity
of your dynasty.

42
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,231
Chief Royal Secretary,
what you said sounds like

43
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:38,569
you are questioning the legitimacy
of the enthronement of His Majesty.

44
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,904
Questioning?

45
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:44,158
I only spoke up
because you tried to defy our order.

46
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,452
That is enough.

47
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,962
What is delaying the investigation
of the death of the Crown Prince?

48
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,131
With all due respect,

49
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,468
poisoning is suspected,
so it is still under investigation.

50
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,848
-What?
-Poisoning?

51
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,807
Poisoning?

52
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,477
There was no sign of poison
during his autopsy?

53
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,273
Who would dare to take
the life of the Crown Prince?

54
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,904
It is not the first time someone has died
from hyeolheogwol in the palace.

55
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,784
Back then,
we concluded he died of illness,

56
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:31,164
but this time, the signs are different,
so we wish to investigate it thoroughly.

57
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,130
Then, Chief State Councilor,

58
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,633
investigate the death
of the Crown Prince thoroughly

59
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,387
so that there is
not a drop of suspicion left.

60
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,350
For that is more important
than appointing the next Crown Prince!

61
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,269
However, Your Majesty,

62
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,979
we cannot leave the position

63
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,814
-of the Crown Prince vacant.
-I will!

64
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,275
Until the cause of his death is apparent,

65
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,819
I will leave that position vacant.

66
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,656
What?

67
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,241
Taekhyeon?

68
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,496
What a load of nonsense.

69
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,663
But Your Majesty,

70
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,791
His Grand Heir is too young,
so some are saying

71
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,001
it is reasonable
to resort to the taekhyeon.

72
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,169
Completely absurd.

73
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,670
There is the law to conform to,

74
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,256
and I still hold my place here.

75
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,676
Also,

76
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,513
he is not the only legitimate son.

77
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,598
So are the grand princes.

78
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,103
But the Queen Dowager
does not approve of the grand princes…

79
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,188
She does not decide the Crown Prince!

80
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,607
What is wrong with my children?

81
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:45,029
Grand Princes Seongnam and Gyeseong
even made it to the second exam.

82
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,239
But Your Majesty,

83
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,201
once the Queen Dowager gets a say,
we may end up resorting to the taekhyeon.

84
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,998
The most important quality
of the Crown Prince

85
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,085
is having the discernment
of one's duties in every circumstance

86
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,380
and putting his own interests aside.

87
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,428
Among the qualities of the Crown Prince,
filial duty is above all others.

88
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,683
Filial duty is the basis
of every action a nobleman takes.

89
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,353
I believe there is
nothing more important than that

90
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,023
to reign in justice
and rule the people in peace.

91
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,948
I have been devastated
by the loss of the Crown Prince,

92
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,118
but seeing my bright princes,

93
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,663
I no longer feel the need to be anxious.

94
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,208
Even though you are not the direct heir,

95
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,463
any of you can become the Crown Prince
if you have what it takes.

96
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,095
Did the Queen Dowager really say that?

97
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,013
Yes.

98
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,932
It does not matter if one
is the Grand Heir or the direct heir.

99
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,560
She will choose the Crown Prince
only by competence.

100
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,438
That means Prince Bogeom
is the most likely.

101
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,064
It does not.

102
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,693
His Highness the Grand Heir
is still the most likely.

103
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,361
I mean,

104
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,197
his infancy did not end long ago.

105
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,698
How can he be the Crown Prince?

106
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,284
Yes, he is still just a little boy.

107
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,661
Does he even know how to read?

108
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,663
He began to read when he was three.

109
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,374
That is not all.

110
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,962
When he was four, he only picked out
desserts with positive words to eat.

111
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,131
And as he learned the Cheonjamun…

112
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,090
Chi, meaning "extravagance."

113
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,594
He said this when he saw the word
that means "extravagance."

114
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,513
That is extravagance.

115
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,978
Even so,

116
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,980
he is far too young
to be the Crown Prince.

117
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,651
His Grand Heir receives education
from his early childhood.

118
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,153
Then there is the Office of Tutelage,
the Office of Early Education,

119
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,530
and eventually Sigangwon.

120
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,157
If he grows up with the education
to rise to the throne,

121
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,828
he is undoubtedly
the most likely to be the king.

122
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,833
How will you corner the Queen

123
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,710
just with rumors of poisoning?

124
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,298
If everyone believes so,
then it becomes the truth.

125
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,011
The more gruesome the rumor is,

126
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,557
the faster and further it spreads.

127
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,143
If the sickly Crown Prince was deposed,

128
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,854
it would have been difficult
for His Grand Heir to succeed,

129
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,107
so she took his life ahead of time.

130
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,443
This is how we shall drive her out.

131
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,240
Have you heard?

132
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,952
His Royal Highness
could have been poisoned to death.

133
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,746
-That is impossible.
-I agree.

134
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,331
He was murdered.

135
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,709
While he was in the
quarters of Her Majesty,

136
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,378
Physician Kwon poisoned him.

137
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,546
Goodness.

138
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,048
He poisoned him under Her Majesty's watch?

139
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,177
Do you think Her Majesty made him do that?

140
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,734
How could she be doing so fine
when her son has just died?

141
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,069
She is so scary.

142
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,780
Then is the rumor true?

143
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,038
Not only will you
dine like the Crown Prince,

144
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,582
but you will
also receive an education like one.

145
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,292
Mother.

146
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,587
Why should we receive
the education of the Crown Prince?

147
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,549
One of you must prove

148
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,219
that you are worthy
of becoming the Crown Prince.

149
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,014
But will the Grand Heir
not be the next Crown Prince?

150
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,558
The position will not
just be given to him.

151
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,060
The same goes for you all.

152
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,313
The Grand Heir is still young,

153
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,814
and you Grand Princes…

154
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,817
People doubt you are qualified.

155
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,778
Mother.

156
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,823
What will happen
if we fail to prove our worthiness?

157
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,996
The Crown Prince will be chosen
through the taekhyeon.

158
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,959
Hence, this calls for you to change too.

159
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,630
While the Crown Prince was with us,
you could just live as princes.

160
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,632
But not anymore.

161
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,014
You can no longer

162
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,683
only do things you wish to do.

163
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,208
Has he still not eaten today?

164
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,211
Regrettably, no, Your Majesty.

165
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,378
Allow me to leave the palace.

166
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,722
Allow me to leave the palace, Mother.

167
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:54,648
Have you forgotten what it took
for you to come into this palace?

168
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,275
My brother

169
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,653
was the only one who wanted me
to remain in the palace.

170
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,825
Yes.

171
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,621
The one who defied his elders

172
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,374
and desperately brought you here
was your brother.

173
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,920
Even I could not do that as the Queen,

174
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,380
but he did it risking his position.

175
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,174
But what?

176
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,760
You wish to leave the palace again?

177
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,932
Your brother who suddenly passed away
is not the only one in your life.

178
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,352
You also have his children
and your younger brothers.

179
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,149
What would your brother

180
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,860
want from you?

181
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,446
Think about that carefully.

182
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,622
I could not have been happier

183
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,792
when you returned
to the palace to live with us.

184
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,128
Watch closely.

185
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,885
This is a character that means the sun,
made to look like it.

186
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,555
And this is

187
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,059
a character made after the moon,
and it means the moon.

188
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,398
These are like us.
You are the sun, and I am the moon.

189
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,780
But the sun and the moon can never meet.

190
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,492
Does it mean we can never live together?

191
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,829
No, the sun and the moon
can also be together.

192
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,708
Like this.

193
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,961
When the sun and the moon meet,
it means "bright."

194
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,422
Does this mean we can live together?

195
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,939
Your Majesty, please save me.

196
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,609
Crown Princess, what is going on?

197
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,776
Your Royal Highness!

198
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,492
Your Majesty, those wretches
are trying to kill my son.

199
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,245
They are the senior court lady
of the Crown Princess' quarters

200
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,955
and the nursemaid to His Grand Heir.

201
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,791
Your Majesty, those wretches
also poisoned the food.

202
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,544
My son continues to suffer
from vomiting and diarrhea!

203
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,587
Your Royal Highness.

204
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,714
His Highness the Grand Heir did not vomit.

205
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,299
Shut your mouth!

206
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,593
Your Majesty.

207
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,972
The ones who hurt the Crown Prince
are also after my son.

208
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,808
I am frightened of the palace.

209
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,977
I cannot trust anybody.

210
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,189
She faced the incident
with His Royal Highness

211
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,275
before she had a chance
to gather herself after the delivery.

212
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,029
She has been delusional since his passing.

213
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,947
You wretch!

214
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,993
How dare you say
the Crown Princess is delusional?

215
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,122
Are you saying she is telling a lie?

216
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,249
-That is not what I mean--
-After investigating,

217
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,961
if I find a speck of suspicion,

218
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,755
you two will not live to see another day.

219
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:09,051
Do not come near the Grand Heir
until everything is as clear as day!

220
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,388
Escort the Crown Princess
and the Grand Heir to my quarters.

221
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,681
Yes, Your Majesty.

222
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,439
I request an investigation.

223
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,194
Some in the palace
are trying to hurt the Grand Heir.

224
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,029
I am aware.

225
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,032
What do you mean?

226
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,952
The Crown Princess came to see me too.

227
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,748
I am investigating in secret,
so do not worry, My Queen.

228
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,379
There are also disgraceful rumors
about the death of the Crown Prince.

229
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,008
I am sure the Crown Princess
is more anxious.

230
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,305
Do you also…

231
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,393
believe the Crown Prince

232
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,979
was poisoned to death?

233
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,315
No, Your Majesty.

234
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,195
I hope that is not the case.

235
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,285
That boy gave us so much joy.

236
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,581
If it is that we failed to protect him,

237
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,086
it would torment me.

238
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,474
Do you not blame me?

239
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,024
You already received
the biggest punishment.

240
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,677
I am all right now.

241
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,516
You no longer have to come at night.

242
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,021
I am not the only one who lost a child.

243
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,859
Please

244
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,029
look after your health.

245
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,890
QUARTERS OF THE QUEEN

246
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,025
Mother.

247
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,069
Promise me…

248
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,281
that you will remain strong.

249
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,075
I will stay by your side

250
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,995
even as the wind.

251
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,419
Please do protect

252
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,881
my son and brothers.

253
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,592
You fool.

254
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,222
You left everyone with me like this.

255
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,748
That is dangerous.

256
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,333
I told you not to go that way.

257
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,001
This way.

258
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,419
Over there.

259
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,301
So?

260
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,345
-Did you look into it?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,472
The silver spoon never reacted

262
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,099
with the food
for His Highness the Grand Heir.

263
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,478
And have you tried his lunch today?

264
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,520
Yes.

265
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,107
But I did not suffer
from diarrhea or vomiting.

266
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,280
With all due respect,

267
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,782
it is true that

268
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:46,119
there is a rumor that the Crown Princess
has suffered from lunacy and delusion

269
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,163
since the passing of the Crown Prince.

270
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,674
Your Majesty.

271
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,967
There is dire news.

272
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,843
Senior Court Lady Shin is…

273
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,517
Poison? That is preposterous.

274
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,228
As I said, that was
the medicine for hyeolheogwol.

275
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,981
How can you be sure
that it was not poisoned?

276
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,442
Have you had it yourself?

277
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,487
-Have you?
-Stop this immediately.

278
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,002
What do you think you are doing?

279
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:39,923
Are you interrogating the senior court
lady of my quarters without my permission?

280
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,342
I was simply following

281
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,596
the order of His Majesty to investigate
the death of the Crown Prince thoroughly

282
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,558
without leaving a speck of suspicion.

283
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,768
Are you not plotting something

284
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,938
while hiding behind the order
of His Majesty?

285
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,857
Plotting?

286
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,653
His Royal Highness passed
in the quarters of the Queen,

287
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,198
so I have a lot of questions for you,
Your Majesty,

288
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,202
but how could I inquire you myself?

289
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,454
That is why

290
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,458
I called your senior court lady
to hold an interrogation.

291
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,253
Next time,

292
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:23,425
you will have to go through
every single formality.

293
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,635
If I go through said formality,

294
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,723
are you willing to be questioned yourself,
Your Majesty?

295
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,483
Sure.

296
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,071
If I am responsible for something,

297
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,032
then I shall accept the request.

298
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,200
However,

299
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,080
if anyone tries to frame me,

300
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,957
I do not care who it is,

301
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,793
I will gnaw on them

302
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:03,340
and slowly finish their last breath.

303
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,351
Court Lady Shin, stand up.

304
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,062
-The interrogation is not--
-If someone has to,

305
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,814
I will interrogate her.

306
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,777
I will notify you if I find suspicions.

307
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,657
Did you not hear my order?

308
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,826
Stand up. Now.

309
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,841
The poisoning suspicion is bait.

310
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,343
Chief State Councilor

311
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,638
is trying to lure me in.

312
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,392
He wants to defame
the Grand Heir and the Grand Princes.

313
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,353
You mean…

314
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,022
Yes.

315
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,068
He is trying to create a reason
to begin the taekhyeon.

316
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,574
What if he finds out that we used medicine
from outside the palace?

317
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,535
He will say I killed the Crown Prince.

318
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,496
Your Majesty.

319
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,207
Physician Kwon somehow held out
until this day,

320
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,750
but if he is further tortured,

321
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,545
he may tell him about the medicine
brought from the outside.

322
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,715
Medicine brought from the outside?

323
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,052
Chief State Councilor
stepped over the line,

324
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,638
which means someone has his back.

325
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,349
I must see Physician Kwon.

326
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,312
Chief State Councilor guards him strictly,
so it will be difficult to meet him.

327
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,148
If I cannot go in,

328
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,526
I shall make him come outside.

329
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,570
Who is out there?

330
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,783
Your Majesty, it is Consort Tae.

331
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:59,247
I heard you have not eaten well lately,
so I decocted this myself.

332
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,709
Please have it

333
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,669
before it gets cold.

334
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,019
Your Majesty.

335
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,647
So who will be the Crown Prince?

336
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,066
Some say it will be
His Highness the Grand Heir,

337
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,652
but some say there will be a taekhyeon.

338
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,781
The taekhyeon is a great method.

339
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,743
If none of the direct heirs
is worthy as the Crown Prince,

340
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,621
then the taekhyeon is another way.

341
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,420
Consort Tae.

342
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,840
Do you hope Prince Bogeom

343
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,010
will become the Crown Prince?

344
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,223
Well, I…

345
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,228
Prince Bogeom is quite bright,
so I guess he can manage.

346
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,939
However, the taekhyeon

347
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,401
is not a simple process
of selecting the Crown Prince.

348
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,779
It is a battle over power
with our lives at stake.

349
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,449
Being the Crown Prince

350
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,160
means being in power.

351
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,002
So if you jump into this rashly,

352
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,631
either you or Prince Bogeom may get hurt.

353
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,385
When that happens,

354
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,472
I may not be able to protect you.

355
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,280
Do you think…

356
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,076
the Crown Prince was really poisoned?

357
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,412
Yes, I think he was poisoned.

358
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,540
To be honest,
his death was all too sudden.

359
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,084
There is one interrogation after another,

360
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,253
so Physician Kwon will confess soon.

361
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,301
Did your father tell you anything?

362
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,597
The investigation is underway,
so we will see the result soon.

363
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,390
Also,

364
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,727
do you think Her Majesty was behind it?

365
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:31,733
Who knows? We may see a name
we have never imagined.

366
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,571
Interrogations often end with
fabricated truths, as you know.

367
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,407
Of course. It is not just poisoning.

368
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,242
Even treason can be suspected.

369
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,535
Poisoning?

370
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,245
Treason?

371
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:51,127
Consorts, are you unable
to filter out museol, fabricated rumors?

372
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,380
You are no different
from the servants of the court

373
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,006
who whisper in the back alley.

374
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,659
Consort Hwang,
what brings you here this late at night?

375
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,870
You must stop the interrogation.

376
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,252
-Your Grace.
-If you do not,

377
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,713
Physician Kwon may mention my name.

378
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,306
Are you…

379
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,894
involved in this?

380
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,026
I was not trying to kill him.

381
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:02,240
I was just trying to make his illness
worse and have him deposed.

382
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,160
I was only trying to teach him a lesson.

383
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,580
But he died.

384
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,502
Why did you do something so big
without consulting me first?

385
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,172
How were you going
to handle the consequences?

386
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,883
I did not kill him. He failed to make it!

387
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,803
No, if you think about it,
I may not have killed him.

388
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,306
I was not told he would cough up blood.

389
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,850
Do you not have any idea
what you have done?

390
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,269
I tried to restore everything
to its rightful place!

391
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,398
I was supposed to be the Queen.

392
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,110
Prince Uiseong was supposed to be
the Crown Prince.

393
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,030
I only tried to make things right.

394
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,240
What did I do so wrong?

395
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,300
What is wrong with you?

396
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,969
We must take him to the Royal Clinic now.

397
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,489
Did you change anything
in the last medicine

398
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,408
the Crown Prince took?

399
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,369
No, Your Majesty.

400
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,831
His symptoms improved after taking that,

401
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,792
so I did not change anything.

402
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,212
Then where did you decoct the medicine?

403
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,798
In the medicine room of the Royal Clinic.

404
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,967
Were you alone when you decocted it?

405
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,302
There were people coming and going,

406
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,972
but I never left the room.

407
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,644
Are you also suspicious

408
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,355
that he was poisoned?

409
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,568
We must get rid of Physician Kwon first.

410
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,194
Let him live.

411
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,406
Do not hurt him.
Do not tell him that you know.

412
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,866
What do you mean?

413
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,367
He knows too much.

414
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,578
You have tortured him enough to know.

415
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,289
He can hold his tongue better than anyone.

416
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,292
And he is the only one
who can touch the body of a royal.

417
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,044
We need a royal physician on our side.

418
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,048
Are you sure

419
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,384
we can trust him?

420
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,137
Please trust me, Your Majesty.

421
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,642
His Royal Highness definitely passed
due to hyeolheogwol.

422
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,189
Are you certain?

423
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,817
Yes, hyeolheogwol is the sole reason.

424
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,528
There cannot be another reason.

425
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,742
In that case,

426
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,828
you must continue to keep quiet

427
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,040
about the medicine from the outside.

428
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,420
And no matter what happens,

429
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,424
do not bring Grand Prince Seongnam

430
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,010
into this matter.

431
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,804
Your Majesty.

432
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,640
All I want

433
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,769
is the safety of my old mother.

434
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,713
Your Majesty, it is Court Lady Shin.

435
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,680
Your Majesty, Chief State Councilor
has stopped the interrogation.

436
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,182
He stopped the interrogation?

437
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,183
Yes.

438
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,521
There were rumors and speculations
all around the palace.

439
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,774
It is such a relief
that everything ended here.

440
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,904
He is not someone
who would end this so easily.

441
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,325
Keep an eye on Chief State Councilor.

442
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

443
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,622
Also, I prepared ice as you requested.

444
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,961
I looked everywhere for you.

445
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,379
I am sorry I am late.

446
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,090
Is Consort Tae
not one of the Queen's people?

447
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,426
What brings you here, Consort Tae?

448
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,136
I asked her to join us.

449
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,638
Please sit over here.

450
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,058
Consort Ko, please let her sit there.

451
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,330
Consort Tae, are you on our side now?

452
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,083
Pardon? What do you mean, on your side?

453
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,502
We gathered to oppose
the succession of the direct heir

454
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,213
and to work together
to begin the taekhyeon.

455
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,423
Oh, my.

456
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,593
In that case,
I am not supposed to be here.

457
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,554
Even if we begin the taekhyeon,

458
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,557
Prince Bogeom will not even be considered.

459
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,560
She will only get her hopes up in vain.

460
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:09,982
Why not?

461
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,444
Is there a reason why
Prince Bogeom cannot make it?

462
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,948
They are right. It is not easy
for Prince Bogeom to be the Crown Prince.

463
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,243
Why is everyone saying
that Prince Bogeom cannot do it?

464
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,581
Choose only one of these.

465
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,256
-This one.
-Why did you choose that one?

466
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,218
Because

467
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,430
it looks elegant
and can hold more than the others.

468
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,391
Precisely.

469
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:48,062
These cups are His Majesty's direct heirs.
These are the sons of concubines.

470
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,731
Exactly, they are all sons of concubines.

471
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,734
So why are they saying it is
only impossible for Prince Bogeom?

472
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,735
Look.

473
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,280
This is Prince Uiseong.

474
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,241
His maternal grandfather
is the chief state councilor,

475
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,370
and he has many people supporting him.

476
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,206
And this is Prince Simso.

477
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,500
Consort Ko's uncle
is the right state councilor.

478
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,335
He also has

479
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,213
quite a few people supporting him.

480
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,800
-I see.
-And this is Prince Bogeom.

481
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,804
No one in his maternal family is powerful,
and no one has his back.

482
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,101
Her Majesty may not have
any powerful family,

483
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,272
but if the direct heirs come in,

484
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,774
no one will choose this one.

485
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,535
What is important
is that the cup is sturdy.

486
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,972
What is with the air
in Jonghak these days?

487
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,599
It feels more like Sigangwon.

488
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,517
I cannot get used to this.

489
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,730
Excuse me, Brother.

490
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,816
What is it like in Sigangwon?

491
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,737
Yes, you were there as the cohort,
so you must know.

492
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,449
Twenty teachers are there
to teach one Crown Prince,

493
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,619
so it has to be more strict than Jonghak.

494
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,246
Twenty?

495
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,249
Wait.

496
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,211
If the Grand Heir
does not become the Crown Prince,

497
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,423
it may really come down to me!

498
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,054
Grand Prince Muan.

499
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,349
We will have to wait and see
who will put on

500
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,601
the gown of the Crown Prince.

501
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,229
There is no reason to wait and see.

502
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,774
-Brother.
-Brother.

503
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,865
So you are still alive, Your Highness.

504
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,535
I have not seen you for a while,

505
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,621
so I thought
there would be another funeral.

506
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,331
Mind your own business.

507
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,752
And the position of the Crown Prince
should not concern you either.

508
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,090
What do you mean, irrelevant?

509
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,509
We are all branches
stemming from the same root.

510
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:27,722
The branch that stemmed out first
should reach the highest, should it not?

511
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,395
It means your parents will be concerned,

512
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,148
so do not climb a tree that is too high.

513
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,821
What did you say, you bastard?

514
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,870
How dare you look down on me?

515
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,122
At least I can dream of it.

516
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,583
You cannot even dream of it,

517
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,836
for you are the son of who was
once a maid of the Queen.

518
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,466
So pick your side wisely

519
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,177
if you want your mother
to live in peace in the palace.

520
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,490
Beg me.

521
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,869
If you kneel down and beg,
I will forgive you.

522
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,164
I would rather be slain.

523
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,416
You bastard.

524
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,257
Are you trying to kill your brother?

525
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,760
Brother?

526
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,514
I am not brothers with this lowly bastard.

527
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,209
Since the Crown Prince croaked,

528
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,546
have you completely lost it?

529
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,549
Shut your mouth.

530
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,595
Rumor has it that your mother killed him.

531
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,180
Have you heard?

532
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,100
What do you think you are doing?

533
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,896
Sheathe that sword at once.

534
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,443
Now.

535
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,028
Sheathe that sword.

536
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,956
I need to find someone.

537
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,379
Goodness, of course, we should.
Who are you looking for?

538
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,132
A handsome guy who ran off with my money.

539
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,927
Our expertise is finding people in debt.

540
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,512
You are at the right place.

541
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,389
My lady, you must be exact.

542
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,642
He did not run off with it.
The dispensary disappeared.

543
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,102
I never got my money anyhow.

544
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,521
That means he ran off with your money.

545
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,647
You speak my language.

546
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,985
Do you draw composites?

547
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,362
You have come to the right man.

548
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,788
Make his eyes look bigger and sharper.

549
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,457
His nose is more defined.

550
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,712
Draw a mole right here.

551
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,589
You got a very good look at him.

552
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,767
This does not look as good as him,

553
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,560
but it is quite similar.

554
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,193
Jonghak is not a place to come
only when you wish to.

555
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,945
I apologize.

556
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,739
You threatened your brother
with a real sword,

557
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,574
so you will be punished.

558
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,707
Starting today, you will remain behind
and read one book a day.

559
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,253
We will not let you leave Jonghak
unless you memorize and recite it.

560
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,589
You tried to stop my mistake
after I made it.

561
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,841
Are you not responsible as my teacher?

562
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,262
I apologize.

563
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,267
Then how shall I be punished?

564
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,229
You missed your chance
to prevent my mistake beforehand,

565
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,108
so please rectify my mistake
through proper poems each time.

566
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,071
I realized my limits
during the cohort selection.

567
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,864
I have much more to learn,

568
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,741
so I must ask questions as I read.

569
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,203
My knowledge may become antiquated
if I study alone,

570
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,247
so will you stay behind and join me?

571
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,668
I sure will.

572
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,684
Where is Grand Prince Seongnam?

573
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,811
He is still in Jonghak studying.

574
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,479
He will be here soon.

575
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,108
But Mother, what is all this?

576
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,197
You will undergo the four-way training
to strengthen your body.

577
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,783
-Pardon?
-In the palace,

578
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,829
the body and mind training of the
Crown Prince was conducted in secret.

579
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,583
He trained his body

580
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,670
by rubbing snow on himself
even when the temperature hit below zero.

581
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,174
I will freeze to death
before I get married!

582
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,053
Mother, why must we go through this?

583
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,639
You are going through this training

584
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,433
to overcome ordeals in the future.

585
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,312
I did not come up with it.
It is the royal education method.

586
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,774
When this is done properly,

587
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,693
you must do it in the snow at night.

588
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,570
Goodness.

589
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,826
Brother!

590
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,995
Hurry and join us.

591
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,914
What are you waiting for?

592
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,998
Get in.

593
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,470
-Come here.
-Hey.

594
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,138
Like this.

595
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,441
Me too.

596
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,777
Zi Lu put on ragged padded clothes,

597
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,115
yet he did not feel ashamed to stand
by a man in luxurious clothes. Why?

598
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:05,661
Because he was awakened to the truth
and did not compare himself to others.

599
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,248
Should it not be interpreted differently
according to his financial situation?

600
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,460
Zi Lu would have felt the same
whether he was wealthy or not.

601
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,965
He was not ashamed
in his ragged padded clothes

602
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,467
because he already knew material affluence

603
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,719
-did not mean his happiness.
-It is quite nice

604
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:26,723
to see the grand princes
have a discussion among themselves.

605
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,228
They are learning
ways to speak and ask questions.

606
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:33,897
There are

607
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,277
teaching methods of the royal family
that only come down to the Queen.

608
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,155
If proving their worthiness

609
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,366
is the only way to avoid the taekhyeon…

610
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,536
That is your opinion.
My thoughts are a bit different.

611
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,914
…we can still prepare them.

612
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,334
A crown prince

613
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,296
is not born.

614
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,716
He is made.

615
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,433
Why do you say that?

616
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,436
You are the smartest among the princes.

617
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,063
Do you think the taekhyeon is held

618
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,566
to choose the wisest one?

619
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,902
Yes, is that not what the taekhyeon is?

620
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,946
The taekhyeon

621
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,282
is just an excuse
to appoint a crown prince

622
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,701
who is not the direct heir of the King.

623
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,037
I see. And?

624
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,333
Everyone says I will not make it.

625
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,795
Prince Bogeom, think about it.

626
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,423
His Majesty was also a son of a concubine.

627
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,593
His mother

628
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,763
was a distinguished concubine
from a noble family.

629
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:53,143
Are you saying
you cannot make it because of me?

630
00:46:58,941 --> 00:46:59,942
Yes.

631
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:05,030
It is because
you were a maid to the Queen,

632
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,784
and because of your lowly family
without any background.

633
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,746
No matter what I do,

634
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,749
I can never be the Crown Prince.

635
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,880
But still, you are all His Majesty's sons.

636
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,091
Do you think all princes are the same?

637
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,926
We may all be princes,

638
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,220
but they do not treat me
like their brother!

639
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,431
What happened to you?

640
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,313
Therefore,

641
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,900
the only thing you can do for me

642
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,737
is to not do anything.

643
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,851
Did you send for me?

644
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,104
What must I do?

645
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,899
What do I have to do
to make him the Crown Prince?

646
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,821
There is just one way.

647
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,121
Do you think we will
resort to the taekhyeon, Uncle?

648
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,458
Everyone seems to be leaning toward it.

649
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,713
I think it will surely happen
if the Queen Dowager helps.

650
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:50,135
But we cannot find a way to have
that sly old fox cross over to our side.

651
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,473
I believe I have a way.

652
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,020
You have got some nerve.

653
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,607
A mere court lady dared
to request to see me alone outside?

654
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:08,320
If it was not something that would
turn the palace upside down,

655
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,490
I would not have dared
to make such a request.

656
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,495
Then speak.

657
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,664
Her Majesty

658
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,208
has met with the leader of traitors.

659
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,962
Who do you mean?

660
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,257
The mother of Crown Prince Taein.

661
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,678
The Queen

662
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,474
met with the deposed Queen Yoon?

663
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,151
Why must it be that maiden?

664
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,987
The daughter of Hwang Won-hyeong
was clearly the worthiest.

665
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,865
I have made the decision already.

666
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,284
Is this your will?

667
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,788
The will of My Queen is my will.

668
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,082
I am the mother of the Crown Prince!

669
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,127
He is no longer your son.

670
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,587
And the Crown Princess

671
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,798
is not chosen as your daughter-in-law.

672
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,383
Your Majesty!

673
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,634
You are

674
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,596
only a concubine
who gave birth to the Crown Prince.

675
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,228
Mother.

676
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:35,449
People might think the mother
of His Royal Highness is the Queen.

677
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,828
How is it that the Crown Princess
is only attached to the Queen?

678
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,319
It is time

679
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,489
for you to choose your successor.

680
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,995
I will leave it vacant for a while.

681
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,382
If you do not think you can advance
the Grand Heir to the position,

682
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,510
then resort to the taekhyeon instead.

683
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:41,014
That is the way
to keep your dignity as the king.

684
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,018
In the end,

685
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:51,399
do you also share
the same thoughts as they do?

686
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,985
Allow them to have their way

687
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,489
while you take the practical benefits.

688
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,825
Even if you proceed with the taekhyeon,

689
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:03,286
you can still choose the prince
of your choice.

690
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,249
Can you not just be supportive
no matter what decision I make?

691
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,210
It does not matter
if the prince is your direct heir.

692
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,212
They are all your sons.

693
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,675
Why must it be the Queen's child?

694
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,177
-Mother.
-Did you forget

695
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,638
the Crown Prince died
after staying in her quarters?

696
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:22,848
The Queen

697
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,852
must pay the price.

698
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,326
Consort Tae, you should be in the palace.

699
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,872
What made you come to my humble abode
at this hour?

700
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,082
I did not simply come to your abode.

701
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,834
I came into your room too.

702
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,796
The King's woman came into your room,

703
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,923
so you must take responsibility.

704
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,133
What…

705
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,634
Responsibility?

706
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,928
What are you trying to do?

707
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,973
It is not about me
but about Prince Bogeom.

708
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,103
Minister Yoon, I want you
to support Prince Bogeom.

709
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,104
What…

710
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,440
This is so sudden.

711
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,234
I am giving you the first chance.

712
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,236
If you do not decide soon,

713
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,781
you will have to stand in the back
when Prince Bogeom is crowned.

714
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:26,995
Very well.

715
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:30,624
I will consider your offer.

716
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,418
No, I need you to promise me now.

717
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:39,633
If you do, I am going to give you a gift.

718
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,931
It is about the Queen.

719
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,147
This is from Lord Yoon Su-gwang.

720
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,524
Minister Yoon?

721
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:11,289
The Queen used medicine
brought from the outside?

722
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,677
So…

723
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,138
You all worked with Physician Kwon?

724
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:28,682
-Yes, sire.
-Yes, sire.

725
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,728
When he treated the Crown Prince,

726
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,857
did Physician Kwon
seem suspicious in any way?

727
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,738
There was nothing suspicious about him.

728
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,990
Is that so?

729
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,200
Nothing suspicious at all?

730
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,660
No, sire.

731
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,386
Now,

732
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,599
let me tell you
what you have seen and heard.

733
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,939
An interrogation?

734
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,149
What do you mean?

735
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,360
Chief State Councilor
requested His Majesty to come,

736
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:26,448
as well as the Queen Dowager
and you, Your Majesty.

737
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,746
What is he up to?

738
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,833
I looked through the records
of Naeyakbang, the Royal Pharmacy.

739
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:40,545
And there is no record
of using any medicine of the palace

740
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:44,049
while you treated His Royal Highness
in the quarters of the Queen.

741
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,762
What medicine was used to treat him?

742
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,438
Your Majesty.

743
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,232
There is suspicion
that Physician Kwon has used

744
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,985
medicine of an unidentified origin
on His Royal Highness.

745
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,280
I also have witnesses who will testify.

746
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:13,078
Either gwibitang or doksamtang is used
to treat hyeolheogwol,

747
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,831
but Physician Kwon used
a different mix of herbs.

748
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,001
Tell him what you saw.

749
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,796
After the medicine was decocted,
I saw something peculiar

750
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,131
as I threw the herbs out.

751
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:37,727
I am sure the herbs
did not belong to the palace.

752
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,566
Let me ask.

753
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,529
How can you be sure
just by looking at the residues?

754
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,198
I have worked in Naeuiwon,
the Royal Clinic, for 17 years.

755
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,992
The sizes of the herbs were different,

756
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,037
but he was suspicious
even before he decocted the medicine.

757
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,834
The color of the wrapping paper
was yellow,

758
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,504
unlike the ones that are used
in Naeyakbang, the Palace Pharmacy.

759
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,799
Your Majesty.

760
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,384
According to the witnesses,

761
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,679
the herbs must have been from the outside.

762
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,934
If the Crown Prince had medicine
brought from the outside,

763
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,311
could that be
the cause of his sudden death?

764
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,148
The prescription varies
according to one's constitution,

765
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,860
and medicine can cause side effects
when used in excess.

766
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,322
Therefore, a prescription made improperly
can cause one's death.

767
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,740
Your Majesty.

768
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,243
The medicine Physician Kwon gave him

769
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,204
was made with herbs
brought in from the outside.

770
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,125
And that is what led
His Royal Highness to death.

771
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,294
That is preposterous.

772
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,504
How could that have killed him?

773
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,673
The one who gave the herbs
to Physician Kwon

774
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,968
is the suspect
who murdered the Crown Prince!

775
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,889
Who gave you those herbs?

776
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,978
Where did you get those herbs?

777
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,564
Disclose the source of them.

778
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,203
In the strictly guarded
quarters of the Queen,

779
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,539
a mere physician
dared to use herbs from the outside

780
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,458
as medicine for the Crown Prince.

781
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,419
Who would have been able to

782
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,380
give such an order
and make the physician do it?

783
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,468
Your Majesty, please answer me.

784
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,477
Your Majesty.

785
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,771
Please answer me!

786
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,612
Do you have evidence
that the medicine from the outside

787
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,197
is what killed the Crown Prince?

788
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,075
Constitution and side effects?

789
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,244
Do not mislead us with such words.

790
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,079
I mean hard evidence.

791
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,997
Physician Kwon, who gave the medicine

792
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,333
to His Royal Highness,
is the evidence, is he not?

793
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,880
Your Majesty.

794
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,299
He claimed the Crown Prince
was poisoned all along,

795
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,385
yet he changed his argument

796
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:18,179
and is claiming he was killed
by medicine from the outside.

797
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,556
And think of what he did.

798
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,600
He brought up
the deposal of the Crown Prince

799
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,561
even before his death.

800
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,439
If anyone wanted him dead,
it would not be me,

801
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,776
but Chief State Councilor.

802
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,072
I suspect that someone
killed the Crown Prince,

803
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,200
and is now trying to slander the Queen.

804
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,456
What do you mean, Queen?

805
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:50,503
Do you mean that
the Crown Prince was actually poisoned?

806
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:51,879
Yes.

807
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,592
He was not the only Crown Prince

808
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,760
who faced a sudden death.

809
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,683
Your Majesty!

810
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:07,812
Her Majesty is arguing
that he was poisoned to death

811
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,023
to hide that she brought in the medicine.

812
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,274
Chief State Councilor!

813
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:15,945
How dare you try to frame the Queen?

814
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,489
If you continue to do so,

815
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:22,869
you will have to be relieved of
not only your position but also your life.

816
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,162
Your Majesty!

817
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:29,083
We just need to know
if Her Majesty is the one

818
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,294
who gave him the herbs from the outside.

819
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,378
Enough!

820
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,008
What are you all doing?

821
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,853
The interrogation will resume tomorrow.

822
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,753
The sudden death of the Crown Prince?

823
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:20,426
How dare you recklessly bring up the past?

824
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,969
How dare you

825
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,349
speak of that time with your mouth?

826
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,558
It looks like

827
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:31,104
you have completely lost your mind.

828
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:32,939
Yes.

829
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,733
After losing my son,

830
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,735
I am no longer afraid of anything.

831
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,656
You must have forgotten
that you have other children left.

832
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,450
Do not lay a hand on them.

833
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,493
Then…

834
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:50,331
you should have been prepared for that
when you met with the deposed Queen Yoon.

835
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,711
Why?

836
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,879
Are you surprised that I know?

837
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,842
I told you already.

838
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,846
All eyes and ears of this palace
lead to my quarters.

839
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,852
Here is what I will do.

840
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,234
If you do not admit

841
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,696
to everything tomorrow,

842
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,534
I plan on exposing that you met
the traitor Queen Yoon

843
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,581
right here during the interrogation.

844
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,627
The biggest mistake I have made in my life

845
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:42,049
is that I failed to stop you
from becoming the Queen.

846
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,843
I dread…

847
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,558
that you are the Queen.

848
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,243
He stopped the interrogation
when the Queen was about to be finished.

849
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,537
If His Majesty does that again tomorrow,

850
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,665
we will not be able to get rid
of the Queen or begin the taekhyeon.

851
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,794
I will not let that happen.

852
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,880
We must reduce His Majesty's choices.

853
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:29,222
How did he find out that you brought
medicine from the outside?

854
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,934
Do you think Physician Kwon told him?

855
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,228
That is not what is important.

856
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,397
We can no longer hide that we used
medicine brought from the outside.

857
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,615
Open.

858
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,208
Your Majesty.

859
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,584
Yes, my grandson.

860
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,800
Smile.

861
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:08,010
Her Majesty told us

862
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,429
not to do anything
to let His Grand Heir notice.

863
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,319
The meal is ready for His Grand Heir.

864
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,779
Yes, bring it in.

865
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,152
This is delicious.

866
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:10,197
My grandson, come here and try some.

867
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,366
I do not wish to eat.

868
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,201
You have not had breakfast either.

869
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,454
Have a bite, will you?

870
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,291
I only like meat.

871
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,345
Here.

872
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,144
Goodness, my grandson.

873
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,065
You are a good painter too.

874
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,566
Who did you draw?

875
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,070
Let me try to guess.

876
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,155
This is

877
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,908
my cute little grandson.

878
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,371
And who is this?

879
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,248
She is my nursemaid.

880
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,709
This is our secret game.

881
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,336
Secret game?

882
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,305
This is a fun game.

883
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,643
But this is a secret game
just between us two.

884
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,899
Nobody else can find out.

885
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,802
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

886
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:27,001
Spit it out, my dear!

887
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,252
Spit it out!

888
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:39,180
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

889
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,915
The Queen is a rat in a trap now.

01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,543
This palace is no longer a safe place.

891
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,630
If you cannot prove that the medicine
is not the cause of his death,

892
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,381
you could die.

893
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:18,177
We must find some sort of evidence
and find out who the enemy is.

894
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,763
Please do the same for me.

895
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,390
Physician Kwon has already
covered up his traces.

896
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,852
Please depose the Queen.

897
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,440
Do you not think
his death is rather strange?
