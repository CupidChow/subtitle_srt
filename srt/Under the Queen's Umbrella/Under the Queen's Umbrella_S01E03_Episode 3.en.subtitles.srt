1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,320
EPISODE 3

3
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,623
He must be at that place again.

4
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,291
We must get rid of it.

5
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:10,004
As long as the secret chamber exists,
it will remain a risk.

6
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,214
Yes, we must.

7
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,259
-We must get rid of it.
-Your Majesty.

8
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,012
Even if someone finds that place,

9
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,516
there will not be a problem as long as
Grand Prince Gyeseong is not there.

10
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,769
We will say that those feminine items
belong to a court lady.

11
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,357
Until the exam is over,

12
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,820
he must not even set foot in that place.

13
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,410
It is true.

14
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,247
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

15
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,927
In the royal palace, one is to forget

16
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,471
everything that they see and hear.

17
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,598
Do you know why?

18
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,895
If what you say is true,
he will face death. But if not,

19
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,358
it is your life
that will be taken, Consort Ko.

20
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,280
Do you still stand by what you are saying?

21
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,075
I cannot be certain,

22
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,330
but I believe I saw
Grand Prince Gyeseong--

23
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,542
Do you expect me to believe something
you cannot be certain of?

24
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,090
Who else did you spread
this groundless rumor to?

25
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,593
I did not, Your Royal Highness.

26
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,471
You are the only person I have told.

27
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,640
I fear for Prince Simso.

28
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,727
He must not have had a good upbringing
from a mother like you.

29
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,066
You clearly said you were not certain.

30
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,986
-Pardon?
-It is not true

31
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,030
unless you are certain of it.

32
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,368
If I ever hear a similar rumor
in the palace,

33
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:07,288
I will assume
that you have been running your mouth.

34
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,420
You said you wished
to repay me for the book.

35
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,174
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.
-The only thing I want in return

36
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,928
is that you provide Prince Simso
with proper education and guidance.

37
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,847
If you understand, you may leave.

38
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,553
Where have you been?

39
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,472
I went for a walk.

40
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,066
Let us go walk some more.

41
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,991
Refrain from taking walks
for the time being.

42
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,454
Concentrate on your studies
until the exam is over.

43
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,832
Focus only on your lessons

44
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,542
and nothing else.

45
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,212
I will not skip my lessons.

46
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,299
I will also study hard.

47
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,927
However, please allow me
to keep taking walks.

48
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,889
It is the only time I can breathe.

49
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,104
Do as I say until the exam is over.

50
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,775
Is there a reason I must become a cohort?

51
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,527
Do you not want to?

52
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,406
If that is not the case, give it a try.

53
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,576
Do you remember what I recently said?

54
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:13,873
You never know
what will happen in the palace.

55
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,625
Therefore,

56
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,878
I would like to be able to
lay my hopes on you.

57
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,051
Hwan.

58
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,180
Could you do as I say

59
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,475
just this once?

60
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,953
CHOSI: FIRST EXAMINATION
OF COHORT SELECTION

61
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,760
-Is it good?
-Yes.

62
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,567
It is made with musk, loquat,
and other medicinal herbs

63
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,610
that are good for the brain.

64
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,988
It is said to enhance
concentration rapidly.

65
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,031
I guess Mother could not make it.

66
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,075
She is the busiest person in the kingdom.

67
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,286
Always remind yourself.

68
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,663
Our mother is the Queen.

69
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,312
Are you ready?

70
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,730
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

71
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,025
You look fairly confident.

72
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:11,532
There must have been
rather insufficient time to prepare.

73
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:17,079
That word is not in my vocabulary.

74
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,085
I mean, the word "insufficient."

75
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,008
You remind me, Consort Hwang,

76
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,428
of my younger self.

77
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,817
What happened?

78
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,279
He said he was going to take a nap,
so I thought he was asleep

79
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,406
and would wake up soon.

80
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,701
But he has not regained
his consciousness ever since.

81
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,371
Crown Prince.

82
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,290
Wake up, Crown Prince.

83
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,711
Why did his condition worsen
all of a sudden?

84
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,923
I saw him this morning,

85
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,800
and he seemed…

86
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,052
perfectly fine.

87
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,098
His condition is deteriorating.

88
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,111
What is this?

89
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,614
It is a journal that His Royal Highness
has kept for the past year.

90
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,137
Do you mean…

91
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,349
this was recorded
by the Crown Prince himself?

92
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,976
Yes, Your Majesty.

93
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,521
From the dates and times when he collapsed
to the treatments that he received,

94
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,816
he recorded every little detail.

95
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,278
He used to collapse
about once every two weeks.

96
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,031
But now he collapses
every three to four days.

97
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,993
Are you saying
he collapses more frequently?

98
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,953
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-More importantly,

99
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,290
he remains unconscious for longer periods.

100
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,172
Your Majesty.

101
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,635
Rumors have spread in the palace
that His Royal Highness is gravely ill.

102
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,387
Just because he skipped
his morning lesson?

103
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,806
It must be because
it never happened before.

104
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,685
What if His Royal Highness cannot attend
his daytime lesson either?

105
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,689
I do not reckon that His Royal Highness
is fit enough to go about daily life.

106
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,984
He will need to focus on his recovery
for his symptoms to improve.

107
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,287
-Eunuch Hong.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,624
Cancel all of the Crown Prince's schedule.

109
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,376
They are starting.

110
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,553
Those who score high
on the first exam today

111
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:24,141
shall be given a chance
to proceed to the second exam.

112
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,019
Reveal the question.

113
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,064
We are going to build an embankment

114
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,858
with a width of 6 ja 4 chi at the top
and a width of 1 gil 5 ja 6 chi

115
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,528
at the base.

116
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,199
The height is 6 ja
and the length is 3 ri 74 bo.

117
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,913
Each worker can complete
364 ja to the power of 3 per day.

118
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,000
It takes an additional one-fourth
of the total workload

119
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,919
to take the soil out of the hole.

120
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,132
How many workers will be needed?

121
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,595
Along with your answer,
explain how you reached that conclusion.

122
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,472
If you have studied arithmetic

123
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,308
using books such as Sanhakgyemong
and Sangmyeongsanbeop,

124
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,811
you will be able to solve
the question easily.

125
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,565
We shall move on
to the composition question.

126
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,110
-There is another question?
-Apparently.

127
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,029
"Yu, sil, and shin."

128
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,990
Using these Chinese characters,

129
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,409
discuss the proper behavior of a wise man

130
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,619
who understands the essence of life.

131
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,291
Reveal the next question as well.

132
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,378
There is yet another question?

133
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,755
This is worse than the civil service exam.

134
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,300
You may begin.

135
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,150
May my son pass the exam.

136
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,921
How are you feeling?

137
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,341
Are you still feeling light-headed?

138
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,177
No, I am feeling better now.

139
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,221
That is a relief.

140
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,933
-Get some more rest.
-No.

141
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,269
I am not finished with my daily lessons.

142
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,648
You do not need to appear
in public for the time being.

143
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,359
Focus on your recovery.

144
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,821
I cannot do that.

145
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,032
Your Royal Highness.

146
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,997
This happened because you returned
to your daily life hastily.

147
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,457
However, Mother,

148
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,210
I have my duties as the Crown Prince.

149
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,294
You cannot fulfill them…

150
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,923
if you lose your health.

151
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,229
Mother.

152
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,609
If I do not attend to my duties,
the palace will be in confusion.

153
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,530
Then are you confident
that you will not collapse in public?

154
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
Will you be able to manage your symptoms?

155
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,498
I am telling you to return
to your duties after you recover.

156
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,585
Even if it is just for two weeks,

157
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,922
I want you to focus on your recovery.

158
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,869
Your Majesty, it is Court Lady Shin.

159
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,372
The examination has just begun.

160
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,832
What are they being tested on?

161
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,126
On arithmetic and composition,
Your Majesty.

162
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,211
The questions differ
from those of the past,

163
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,172
so the examinees seem perplexed.

164
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,427
His Majesty also posed
one rather unusual question.

165
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,347
An unusual question?

166
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,557
Reveal the final question.

167
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,273
Draw one line to create two half-moons.

168
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,698
You should not overthink it.

169
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,120
Think out of the box,
and you will find the answer.

170
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,800
We will end the examination.

171
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,227
The answers are
just as bizarre as the question.

172
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,815
What in the world is this?

173
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,903
But is that not correct?

174
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,200
He created two half-moons
by drawing one line

175
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,535
as the question required.

176
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,454
I agree.

177
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,874
It is very thick, but he did draw
one line, so I agree it is correct.

178
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,960
He thought out of the box
as His Majesty said.

179
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,798
I would argue that these answers
are much more correct.

180
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,757
Yes.

181
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,551
They folded the paper
to create a full moon,

182
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,470
which they then split in half.

183
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,264
They surely are excellent as well.

184
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,227
There is no one correct answer
to that question.

185
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,603
Remain seated.

186
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,774
Any answer that makes sense
shall be deemed correct.

187
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,567
Let me see.

188
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,038
I have never thought of this.

189
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,458
How interesting.

190
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,755
When will the results be announced?

191
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,466
Are the results not predictable?

192
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,970
What do you mean by that?

193
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,556
All the princes have been
secretly tutored.

194
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,976
It does not end there.
Some even hired geobyeok, expert scribes.

195
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,980
Not only Jonghak tutors
and Sungkyunkwan students

196
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:12,025
but also the tutors of the Crown Prince
at Sigangwon have been hired.

197
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,068
My goodness.

198
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,571
-By whom?
-Whom else?

199
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,531
Those darned distinguished concubines.

200
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,660
But that is against the rules, is it not?

201
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:26,165
It gave them a head start. What are we,
mothers without resources, to do?

202
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,749
Darn it.

203
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,961
What if Prince Bogeom fails the exam?

204
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,382
I think the purpose of the exam today
is to screen out the examinees.

205
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,176
How many will be eliminated?

206
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,888
Only those who achieve top scores
will proceed to the second exam.

207
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,848
Everyone else will be eliminated.

208
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,726
That is extremely harsh.

209
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,533
"Gong," meaning "together."

210
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,744
"Jo," meaning "to help."

211
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:08,498
I believe all of you understand
the meaning of the word "gongjo."

212
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,876
This word is our sign.

213
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,256
If you see this word, it means
it is Prince Uiseong's answer sheet.

214
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,634
TONG: OUTSTANDING

215
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,855
"Pass"?

216
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,733
Who in the world had the audacity
to give him this poor grade?

217
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,742
DAETONG: PARTICULARLY OUTSTANDING

218
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,786
Here is the answer
to the arithmetic question.

219
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,164
Who gave this absurd answer?

220
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,874
Have a look at this.

221
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,378
This examinee is trying to lecture
the examiners in his answer.

222
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:59,508
He must have thought he could
scribble whatever sprang to his mind.

223
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,719
Give him a "bangoe" and be done with it.

224
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,597
BANGOE: UNDESERVING OF A GRADE

225
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,517
Unbelievable. Here you go.

226
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:16,400
-"Based on the provided information,
-…provided information,

227
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,777
-the number of workers required…
-the number of workers required

228
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,612
would be close to 1,413.

229
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,575
In reality, however,
that number would be erroneous,

230
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,705
for the number should vary
depending on the season.

231
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,708
Productivity decreases in spring

232
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,168
compared to summer
as the days are shorter.

233
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,256
In autumn, productivity varies
even more greatly

234
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,592
as most workers are farmers.

235
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,973
Therefore, the mobilization of farmers
should be avoided during the harvest.

236
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,270
Also, the work hours
should not interfere with the harvest.

237
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,151
In short, when calculating the number
of workers required for public works,

238
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,653
one should consider the season

239
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,614
as well as the circumstances
that the people are in.

240
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,372
PRINCE UISEONG, PRINCE BOGEOM

241
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,508
As expected, Prince Bogeom made the list.

242
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,471
Consort Tae must be so proud.

243
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,474
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM
GRAND PRINCE GYESEONG

244
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,558
Wait a second.

245
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,853
Why are those names on the list?

246
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,150
What is going on?

247
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,443
I have no idea.

248
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,572
What an unexpected outcome.

249
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,078
Forgive me, Mother.

250
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,955
But I did my best.

251
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,042
How could you say that
after seeing those results?

252
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,836
Even the worst student at Jonghak passed.

253
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,758
So did Grand Prince Gyeseong, that freak.

254
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,468
How could you…

255
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,847
How could you say that you did your best?

256
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,654
The princes who passed
the first examination

257
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,448
shall take the second examination
in four days.

258
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,534
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

259
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,966
My Queen, what brings you here?

260
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,137
I have been waiting
to discuss an important matter with you.

261
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,222
What is the matter?

262
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,475
It concerns the Crown Prince.

263
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,357
His Royal Highness was absent
from his daytime lesson as well?

264
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,778
Yes. It seems that he has caught a cold.

265
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,156
That cannot be it.

266
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:14,786
I presume that something much worse
happened to him.

267
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,123
The selection process this time around…

268
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:24,296
might not simply end
with a cohort selection.

269
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,299
Then we shall speak in private.

270
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,301
No, Your Majesty.

271
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,847
Most officials here are also the tutors
of the Crown Prince at Sigangwon.

272
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,266
I would like their opinion

273
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,227
on deciding the future schedule
of the Crown Prince.

274
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,314
The future schedule of the Crown Prince?

275
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,693
Yes. To be precise,

276
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,697
I ask you to grant him your permission
to visit a hot spring.

277
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,160
Has his skin disease gotten worse?

278
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,287
No, Your Majesty.

279
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:01,249
It is to prevent it from getting worse.

280
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:06,922
A visit to a hot spring
was recommended by his physician.

281
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,467
The officials are occupied
with the cohort selection lately.

282
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,303
If the Crown Prince needs a change of air,

283
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,764
this would be the perfect time.

284
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,477
Your Majesty.

285
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,438
It is true that the authoring
and grading of the exam

286
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,690
have prevented us
from paying full attention

287
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,901
to the daily lessons
of His Royal Highness.

288
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,486
Your Majesty.

289
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,032
His Royal Highness
is the heir to the throne.

290
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:38,870
Devoting himself to learning
should be his top priority.

291
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,373
However,

292
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:48,755
nothing would matter more
than the health of the Crown Prince.

293
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,274
See? I told you.

294
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,358
What did I do?

295
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,652
You said the situation
of the Crown Prince was dire.

296
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,987
I was not the only one who said that.

297
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,865
Also, why would he need a change of air
if he was in good health?

298
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,409
It is just a skin disease.

299
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,453
It is no news
that he is suffering from it.

300
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:25,250
I also want to visit Onyang
and relax in a hot spring.

301
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,156
We will be serving you in the quarters
of Her Majesty starting today.

302
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,954
The Crown Prince went for a change of air.

303
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,792
Did you not say that the Queen Dowager
implied that his condition was grave?

304
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,837
Yes, it definitely sounded quite serious.

305
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:17,135
But the Queen said
that it was a mere skin disease.

306
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:22,140
I will closely watch
the quarters of the Queen.

307
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,188
By the way, what happened
in the first exam?

308
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,400
After all the preparation, Prince Uiseong
failed to come in first place.

309
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,613
The King posed a question
that had not been planned.

310
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,908
Who would have foreseen
such an unusual question?

311
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,702
This may be a good thing.

312
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,247
Now we have learned

313
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,584
that His Majesty can act
unpredictably at any time.

314
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,422
Now that we know,
we can better prepare for the second exam.

315
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,633
You are right.

316
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,135
The first exam results
are of no importance anyway.

317
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,678
What matters is the second exam.

318
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,391
No matter what move the King makes
this time, we will be prepared.

319
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,850
We will be.

320
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,728
The prince who becomes
the cohort of the Crown Prince

321
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,314
will be able to take his place.

322
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,486
The news of the departure
of His Royal Highness

323
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,239
managed to suppress
rumors about his disease.

324
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,825
Rumors are covered by rumors.

325
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,120
However, we can hide the truth
for only so long.

326
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,997
The Crown Prince must recover in time

327
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,459
and prove he is completely healthy.

328
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,449
It is time to face…

329
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,036
the true side of Grand Prince Gyeseong.

330
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,813
Welcome.

331
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,109
Her Royal Highness
has been waiting for you. Please.

332
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,778
I am more nervous
than on my first night with His Majesty.

333
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,495
Even though this is strictly confidential,

334
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,207
Prince Bogeom came in first place
in the first exam.

335
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,170
Oh, my goodness.

336
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,755
Is that true?

337
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,842
I was elated that he proceeded
to the second exam.

338
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,012
But he even came in first place?
This is unbelievable!

339
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:19,854
Forgive my ungraceful behavior,
Your Royal Highness.

340
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:24,275
A mother is meant to laugh and cry
over every event in the life of her child.

341
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,655
Who knows? Prince Bogeom
may end up becoming a cohort.

342
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,078
That would be absolutely wonderful.

343
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:38,831
However, Prince Bogeom does not have
the Queen as his mother.

344
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,335
Also, his maternal relatives are not
as powerful as those of Prince Uiseong.

345
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,964
He has no one to have his back.

346
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,092
I could not even find him tutors
like the distinguished concubines.

347
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:53,846
I am well aware that it will take
far more than his own capabilities.

348
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,224
Then,

349
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,310
what if I support Prince Bogeom?

350
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,480
Are you confident
in making him the cohort?

351
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,110
It makes no difference to me
who the mother is.

352
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,987
Each of them is my precious grandson.

353
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:14,575
So I am thinking of having his back
as his grandmother.

354
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,704
Oh, my.

355
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,585
As long as he has your support,
he could do anything.

356
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,924
As long as you keep the promise
you made to me the other day,

357
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:35,221
I am willing to provide my grandson
with the position that he deserves.

358
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,516
What do you say?

359
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:46,149
But what can you give me in return,
Consort Tae?

360
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,318
I will obey

361
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,905
whatever orders you give me.

362
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,741
What if…

363
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,618
it is your life that I want?

364
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,423
How would I forget that promise?

365
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:14,260
After all the kindness you have shown me,
I will always remain loyal to you.

366
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,518
Would there be a way

367
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,731
to keep Grand Prince Gyeseong away
from that place for the time being?

368
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,529
How can I stop him?

369
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,868
I know.

370
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,914
There is a way.

371
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,424
Why is Mother doing this?

372
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:57,929
I never study even when I am alone.
Being with you certainly will not help.

373
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,849
She has been acting strange lately.

374
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,519
Brother.

375
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,521
I refuse to answer any academic questions.

376
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,857
Have you been studying behind our backs?

377
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,528
Not at all. I was just lucky.

378
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,578
Do you have any snacks with you?

379
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,497
-He is dead?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

380
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,042
Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk
passed away long ago.

381
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,462
Why? What happened?

382
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:35,091
He is said to have spent some time
treating the plague in Gangwon-do

383
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,260
after he left the palace.

384
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,678
And?

385
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,847
But not long after,

386
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,017
he and his son died in a house fire.

387
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,603
There was another fire?

388
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,069
Is it certain it was
Royal Physician Yoo Sang-uk who died?

389
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,779
Yes, Your Majesty.

390
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,532
Apparently, his burned body was found

391
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,993
along with his belongings.

392
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,208
That means…

393
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,048
there is no one left
who remembers what happened back then.

394
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,178
All the records

395
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,972
and people…

396
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,310
disappeared in fires.

397
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,324
Her Majesty went so far

398
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:45,203
as to deceive His Majesty
and hid the Crown Prince in her quarters?

399
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,123
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

400
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,877
Is the Crown Prince
unable to even walk now?

401
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,420
No, Your Royal Highness.

402
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,132
Her Majesty was told
that he would recover within two weeks

403
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,843
if he postponed his plans
and focused on his recovery.

404
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,721
That is why Her Majesty is pretending
that he is away.

405
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,726
Are you saying
the Crown Prince is recovering?

406
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,328
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

407
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,039
He is recuperating.

408
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,540
Court Lady Shin.

409
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:40,508
Among the Grand Princes,
who do you think is the brightest?

410
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:46,222
In my humble opinion,
it is Grand Prince Gyeseong.

411
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,100
I see.

412
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,646
You have watched him grow up.

413
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,190
What is your opinion of him?

414
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,528
He is the gentlest and the most
good-natured Grand Prince of all.

415
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,154
Court Lady Shin.

416
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,993
I heard a dreadful rumor about him
is spreading in the palace.

417
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,037
Have you heard of it?

418
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,747
Pardon?

419
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,791
A dreadful rumor?

420
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,088
Forget it.

421
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,965
You may leave.

422
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,981
She confessed that His Royal Highness
is in the quarters of Her Majesty.

423
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,609
She must be telling the truth.

424
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,740
It seems that Her Majesty

425
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,285
is unaware of the secret
of Grand Prince Gyeseong.

426
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,202
What shall we do?

427
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:56,542
Both Her Majesty and His Majesty
should know about it

428
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,294
as it concerns their own child.

429
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,319
Why is the treatment not taking effect?

430
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,238
All known remedies are being employed,

431
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,950
but it is difficult to ascertain
what the problem is.

432
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,582
Your Majesty.

433
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,502
There is a problem.

434
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:44,298
Her Royal Highness seems to have found out
about Grand Prince Gyeseong.

435
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,301
What shall we do?

436
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,807
If she really has,
she will attempt to find evidence.

437
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,059
I have to stop Grand Prince Gyeseong
from going to that place.

438
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,769
I am going to his quarters.

439
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,902
Your Majesty, Her Royal Highness
has asked for your audience urgently.

440
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,531
Please tell her
I will visit her this evening.

441
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,327
I cannot make time at the moment
because of banquet preparations.

442
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,705
She said that it concerned
Grand Prince Gyeseong.

443
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:29,427
Go and check
if the banquet is being prepared properly.

444
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,930
Report to me immediately
if there is any problem.

445
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,683
Yes, Your Majesty.

446
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,003
My Queen.

447
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,088
Where are you headed?

448
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,385
I was on my way
to the quarters of Her Royal Highness.

449
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,222
How thoughtful of you.

450
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,895
Her Majesty makes sure
this old woman does not feel lonely.

451
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,358
You came at the right time.

452
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,653
I am going for a walk with His Majesty.

453
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,406
Would you care to join us?

454
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,702
I would be delighted if you joined us.

455
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,334
With pleasure.

456
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,308
He is not in. He went for a walk.

457
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,393
When did he leave?

458
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,231
He left just a moment ago,
so he could not have gone far.

459
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:07,900
I see.

460
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,235
Excuse me.

461
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,655
Is everything well
with Grand Prince Gyeseong?

462
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,115
The Queen Dowager had just sent
someone here as well.

463
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,215
Your Majesty.

464
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:35,636
Would you like to visit a place
you have never been to before?

465
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,097
Is there such a place in this palace?

466
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,309
The palace is quite a labyrinth.

467
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,688
Even I sometimes stumble upon new places.

468
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,398
Is that right?

469
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,984
Your Majesty.

470
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,237
There is a problem with the banquet.

471
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,197
You need to come immediately.

472
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:03,205
If you will excuse me,
I must leave you now.

473
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,000
The banquet is not until tomorrow.

474
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,960
What is the hurry?

475
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,339
It is the banquet held
following the sacrificial rite.

476
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,925
It is to be prepared with utmost care.

477
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,182
Due to my incompetence,
there has been a mistake.

478
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,353
Would you be so kind as to come with me

479
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,607
and share your wisdom with me?

480
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,236
I am merely an old woman
who has never been the Queen.

481
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,155
I would be of no help.

482
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,908
I would only be a burden.

483
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,202
You may leave, My Queen.

484
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,412
Your Majesty.

485
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,082
Let me stay with you
and escort you myself, Mother.

486
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,839
I was going to show you
a rather amusing sight.

487
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,301
It is such a shame, Your Majesty.

488
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,349
Shall we, Mother?

489
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,634
I have never been here before.

490
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,135
I presumed so.

491
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,305
Down this path,

492
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,226
there is a secret chamber
hidden from view.

493
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,145
A secret chamber?

494
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,439
Yes.

495
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:57,611
Are you not curious to find out
just what is hidden there?

496
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:15,939
Your Majesty. As the chamber
was unoccupied, there were no casualties.

497
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,858
The fire will be extinguished shortly.

498
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,486
It is nothing serious,
so you do not have to worry.

499
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,531
The fire has yet to be contained.
We must leave.

500
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,813
Her Royal Highness is here.

501
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,490
You may all leave.

502
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,627
The fire was a rather spectacular sight.

503
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:23,423
A fire surely does not occur
very frequently in the palace.

504
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,009
I was too late this time.

505
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,679
But next time, I shall reveal

506
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,932
the ugly truth about Grand Prince Gyeseong
to the whole world.

507
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,395
A fire destroys many things.

508
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:42,109
There is no evidence left whatsoever.

509
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:46,071
Who would believe what they cannot see?

510
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,156
Your Majesty.

511
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,827
My grandson
whom you are hiding in your quarters…

512
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,288
He had better regain his health.

513
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,458
You should also bring
the rest of your sons to their senses.

514
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:03,714
Otherwise, I shall replace
those sickly and detestable brats

515
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,758
with worthy ones to protect my own son.

516
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,637
It must be your specialty

517
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,349
to drag down the son of the Queen

518
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,727
and set the son of a concubine
on the throne.

519
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,396
Yes, it is indeed.

520
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,401
I have done it once.
Who is to say I cannot do it again?

521
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,655
That was one huge fire.

522
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,866
I thought I was going to die in that fire.

523
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,327
My goodness, I am exhausted.

524
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,418
SUSEONGGEUMHWASA:
FIRE SUPPRESSION OFFICE OF THE PALACE

525
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,837
-There is something I must ask.
-Yes, Your Highness.

526
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,257
How did you extinguish a fire
in such a secluded place so quickly?

527
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,969
We received a report
soon after the fire started.

528
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,848
Who was the first person
to report the fire?

529
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,309
It was a court lady.

530
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,937
I heard people saying
that she serves Her Majesty.

531
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,585
Was it you, Mother?

532
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,003
Yes.

533
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,715
It was me.

534
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,010
How could you do that?

535
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:41,556
If you found that place,
you must know the truth about me.

536
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,059
How could you be so cruel to me?

537
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,103
There are eyes and ears all around us.

538
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,897
Lower your voice.

539
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,651
You destroyed my everything.

540
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,528
It was to protect you.

541
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,072
How was that supposed to protect me?

542
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,826
Did you do that
because you were ashamed of me?

543
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,869
You are the one who hid yourself.

544
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,039
And you are the one who failed to hide it
and got caught.

545
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:09,709
You could have turned a blind eye.

546
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:14,256
You could have just looked the other way.

547
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:20,011
Are you happy now that you have burned
that place to the ground?

548
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:30,313
Do you know why I burned that place down?

549
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,818
I shall show you.

550
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,404
Meet me outside the East Gate.

551
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,652
Follow me.

552
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,202
Now!

553
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,874
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

554
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,460
Of course not.

555
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,880
I lost my son overnight.

556
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,262
What will I do about the cohort selection?

557
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,183
But you see,

558
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,480
I tried to imagine how he must have felt

559
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:45,735
when he failed to overcome it
and had no choice but to accept it.

560
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,782
He must have been so scared.

561
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,124
That is why…

562
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,794
I could not look the other way.

563
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,881
I am his mother.

564
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,826
You know everything about me now.

565
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:36,953
Be careful.

566
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:43,209
Had I not shown you
the secret shortcut earlier,

567
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,337
you would not have been
able to set the fire in time.

568
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:51,259
Does that make us even, Your Majesty?

569
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,136
Says who?

570
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,537
Take it.

571
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,541
But you know,

572
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:27,045
if you take it, there is no turning back.

573
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,099
We must…

574
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,478
pull ourselves together now.

575
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,653
Starting from tomorrow,

576
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,739
the real battle begins.

577
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,634
One may have very different wishes

578
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,470
from those of others.

579
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,683
However,

580
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,396
one should not reveal
everything in their heart.

581
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,074
Whenever

582
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,952
you want to see your true self,

583
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,456
look at that painting.

584
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,132
Did it make you upset?

585
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,971
When I first found out,

586
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,267
I was at a loss for a while.

587
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:31,979
But…

588
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,024
I was not upset.

589
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,787
No matter how you look,

590
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,710
you will always be my child.

591
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,440
This is my favorite hairpin.

592
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,026
It used to belong to my mother.

593
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,447
I would have given it to my daughter
if I had one.

594
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,367
It is yours now.

595
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,055
There will come a day

596
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,560
when those who have
different wishes from those of others

597
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,439
no longer have to hide.

598
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,996
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

599
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:21,274
It was the best decision I could make
to protect your brother.

600
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,861
Once the Crown Princess gives birth,
he will have no choice but to appear.

601
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,612
There is a disease called hyeolheogwol.

602
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,531
I want to find
a physician who can treat it.

603
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:32,285
I wish to discuss
the problem of the hut village in Seochon

604
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,578
with my princes today.

605
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,330
No one will notice even if we go out.

606
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,126
I need you to help me this time.

607
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,046
How could he not
show up to his princess' delivery?

608
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,591
Has the Crown Prince not returned?

609
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:52,221
