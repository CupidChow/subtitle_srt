00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,083
EPISODE 10

3
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,647
Do you know Physician Kwon O-gyeong?

4
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,449
Do you mean the physician
who treated His Royal Highness?

5
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,492
Yes.

6
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,371
I heard you were the one
who recommended him

7
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,582
as the physician for the Crown Prince.

8
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,000
Is that true?

9
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,963
How could a mere concubine

10
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,675
make a recommendation
for the physician of the Crown Prince?

11
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,305
However, I did mention to my father

12
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,141
that Physician Kwon treated me
for a stomach ulcer.

13
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,644
Butâ€¦

14
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,438
why do you ask?

15
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,691
I wondered

16
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:54,614
if I could find his whereabouts
through you.

17
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,786
I wish to bring him back to the palace,

18
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,873
but I cannot seem to reach him.

19
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:14,717
May I ask why you wish
to bring him back to the palace?

20
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,979
How could you lose the ground plan?

21
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,482
Our plan may get exposed
if the location of our armory is revealed.

22
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,110
You need to see this too.

23
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,824
Is this not a royal edict?

24
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,450
A royal edict?

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,414
You are appointed as the head
of the Royal Commandery Division?

26
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,169
What is the King after?
Why do you think he gave me such an edict?

27
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,547
This may be a trap.

28
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,967
You cannot make a rash move.

29
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,093
No.

30
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,928
It does seem dangerous,

31
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,431
but it could also be
an opportunity for us.

32
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:03,975
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,396
Do you suspect Physician Kwon was involved
in the death of His Royal Highness?

34
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,566
Does it not seem strange?

35
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,319
Not only did he suddenly disappear,

36
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,197
but his whereabouts are also a mystery.

37
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,953
Have you not heard from the one
we sent to his hometown?

38
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,996
No.

39
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,831
We are trying to look into his past,

40
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,584
but it does not seem easy
to find any traces of it.

41
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,463
In that case,

42
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:38,092
look into the connection between the
Chief State Councilor and Physician Kwon.

43
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,302
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,887
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,139
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,227
Grand Prince Muan
is in Hanseong right now.

47
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,269
What?

48
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,646
Grand Prince Muan?

49
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,314
Why is he there?

50
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,358
Hanseong?

51
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,875
So,

52
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,168
you wished to speak to me?

53
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,391
I will accept your offer,

54
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,518
receive the royal edict,
and go to the palace.

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,732
You made a wise decision.

56
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,276
Let me escort you there
according to the royal command.

57
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,778
But on one condition.

58
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,790
You cannot take Seo Ham-deok
to the palace.

59
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,459
Why not?

60
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,045
Are you anxious
since I am about to win the contest?

61
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,172
He is plotting treason.

62
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,507
He is a rebel who gathered monks
to plan a rebellion.

63
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,845
I even saw the weaponry he hid in a cave.

64
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,932
Do you expect me to believe you?

65
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,102
I found this in his chamber.

66
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,231
It shows the way into the King's
bedchamber and the hall of governance.

67
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,485
On top of that,
Seo Ham-deok is under suspicion of murder.

68
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,029
I do not care.

69
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,615
I will bring him to the palace

70
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,992
even if he is plotting treason
or murdered someone.

71
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,329
If you insist on taking him,

72
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,247
I will stop you.

73
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,959
I will tell Father everything.

74
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,129
Is that so?

75
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,839
Go ahead and try.

76
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,842
But you better do your best.

77
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,637
I will kill anybody who stands in my way.

78
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,680
Even if it is you.

79
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,357
Travel relentlessly. You must arrive
before Grand Prince Gyeseong.

80
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,307
How could you stray during the contest

81
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,144
only to spend the night with a woman?

82
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,522
It is not a sin to fall in love.

83
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,065
Does that make it okay?

84
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,402
Forget it.

85
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,195
You no longer qualify.

86
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,240
Go to the quarters of the Crown Prince
and retrieve your plaque yourself!

87
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,492
Yes.

88
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,036
I was planning on doing that anyway.

89
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,331
To be honest,

90
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:42,211
I do not even have the slightest ambition
to be the Crown Prince.

91
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,214
To be even more honest,
that is what you wanted, not me.

92
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,009
I never said I wanted to do it.

93
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,719
Court Lady Shin.

94
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,639
Take him away immediately
before I kill him myself.

95
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,854
What will you do about her?

96
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,357
I am not fooling around with Cho-wol.

97
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,278
Please allow me
to have her as my concubine.

98
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,155
What?

99
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,282
Your concubine?

100
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:17,288
You are not even married,
yet you wish to have a woman you love

101
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,916
-only as your concubine?
-You must leave now. Hurry!

102
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,595
Where is she right now?

103
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,686
Have you forgotten what I said to you?

104
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,438
I have not.

105
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,691
So I tried my best.

106
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,318
I thought

107
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,862
I could do it if I tried.

108
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,907
Did you think it would be easy
to take your heart back?

109
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,701
That is why I tried to stop this

110
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,663
before your love grew deeper.

111
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,001
Do you think he will be
any different from other noblemen?

112
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,338
He says he is not fooling around with you

113
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,341
but he only wants
to have you as a concubine.

114
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,763
He may be my son,

115
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,976
but he is not someone
you can depend on for life.

116
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,603
I do not wish to depend on him for life.

117
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:28,067
I am happy to remain as a jieum
he shares his heart with.

118
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,193
JIEUM: CONGENIAL FRIEND

119
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:40,371
It is not too late to take back
your love for Grand Prince Muan.

120
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,127
If you tell me to cut our ties,

121
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,546
I shall do that.

122
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,506
However,

123
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,264
I cannot promise
to take back my love for him.

124
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,228
I was the one who gave him my love
and let it grow.

125
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,439
It was all my choice.

126
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,527
Please let me choose how this will end.

127
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,548
I thought you would be different.

128
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,972
"Even if one is born
into a low social status or as a woman,

129
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,017
their life should not be any different."

130
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,479
I heard you were the one
who taught him so.

131
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,524
Is that not why you established Hyewolgak?

132
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,156
Just resent me instead.

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,077
When it comes to my children,

134
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,205
I am only a selfish woman
who speaks empty words.

135
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,174
-Over here.
-Here.

136
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,175
Over here.

137
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,346
Over here.

138
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,847
Hush-a-bye

139
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,226
Hush-a-bye, my baby

140
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,938
Sleep well

141
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,565
My baby

142
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,026
Hush-a-bye

143
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,862
5 YEARS AGO

144
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,489
-How can this be?
-Goodness.

145
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,157
-What has she done?
-Goodness me.

146
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,493
-She should be ashamed.
-He should kick her out.

147
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,120
It is that girl.

148
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,329
You wretch!

149
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,583
How dare you frame your master
and report him to the government office?

150
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,085
Frame you?

151
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,964
You raped me!

152
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,340
You littleâ€¦

153
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,885
You are still out of your mind.

154
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,637
What are you all doing?

155
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,485
What is going on?

156
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,655
I am teaching a lesson
to my loose handmaiden,

157
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,408
so mind your own business
and go on your way.

158
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,368
I wanted to go on my way,

159
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,329
but you two seem to contradict each other.

160
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,175
Is it true that you were raped by him?

161
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,263
That wretch.

162
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,100
You will get hurt if you stay here.

163
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,728
I am all right, so you should leave.

164
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,980
I am all right too.

165
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,193
Stay right behind me.

166
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,536
Is it true that you raped this woman?

167
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,043
Rape?

168
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,505
That lustful lowly brat
wanted to turn her life around,

169
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,381
so she threw herself at me.

170
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,761
She is a promiscuous woman,
so the child may not be mine.

171
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,555
-My goodness.
-Why did she do that?

172
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,806
-What was that?
-Did she slap him?

173
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,975
-Oh, my.
-She slapped a nobleman.

174
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,561
You wretch!
Did you just lay your hands on me?

175
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,271
Yes, I did.

176
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,233
Not only did you rape that woman,

177
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,069
but you also framed and humiliated her,

178
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,404
inflicting harm on her again.

179
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,949
You must be out of your mind.

180
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,700
What are you all doing?

181
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,118
Stop right there!

182
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,622
Goodness, Your Majesty the Queen.

183
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,041
-Her Majesty?
-She is the Queen?

184
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,668
-Goodness.
-Oh, my.

185
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,712
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

186
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,426
What shall I do?

187
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,263
Should I make a request to His Majesty

188
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,682
and get to the bottom of it?

189
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,726
I deserve to die.

190
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,062
-Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
-You are wrong.

191
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,401
You are not to apologize to me.

192
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,944
Yes.

193
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,572
I amâ€¦ I am sorry, Eo-ri.

194
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,532
Not only did I rape you,

195
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,617
but I also blamed you for everything.

196
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,453
Please forgive me.

197
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,496
Your Majesty.

198
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,040
You have consoled me enough.

199
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,168
I plead with you to stop.

200
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,880
Once you leave,

201
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,091
my life may become even harder.

202
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,720
I have already meddled with your life.

203
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,262
-Over here!
-I got you!

204
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,180
Over here!

205
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,057
Hey!

206
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,058
I got you!

207
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,769
-Here!
-Over here!

208
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,856
This is where you will stay from now on.

209
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,984
-Show her the way.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

210
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,862
This way.

211
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,872
-Right here.
-Over here!

212
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,960
My baby

213
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,504
Will wake up

214
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,008
Hush-a-bye, my baby

215
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,844
Do you also think
I am too harsh on Cho-wol?

216
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,269
That girl did not back down against me.

217
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,857
I guess she grew up well here.

218
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,612
She seems to be destined
to be a part of your life.

219
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:33,367
After all, Hyewolgak was established
because of her.

220
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,247
Have you decided on the name?

221
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,126
Yes, I feel like the baby is a girl.

222
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,044
So I will name her Cho-wol.

223
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,879
Cho-wolâ€¦

224
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,298
What a beautiful name.

225
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,428
Goodness.

226
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,847
What is it?

227
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,684
My baby suddenly began to move
after hearing that name.

228
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,692
Hush-a-bye, my baby

229
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,155
Hush-a-bye

230
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,866
My baby

231
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,869
GRAND PRINCE MUAN

232
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:23,417
PRINCE UISEONG, GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM,
GRAND PRINCE GYESEONG, PRINCE BOGEOM

233
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,888
I will take it separately.

234
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,973
This is from Her Grace, Consort Tae.

235
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,643
You have one day left.

236
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,647
You must leave at sunrise as you promised.

237
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,868
Shin Baek-deok!

238
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,495
Give him four mal and five doe.

239
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,497
-Very well.
-Goodness, that was worth my while.

240
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,540
That was worth it.

241
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,792
Next, Hwang Sun-ok.

242
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,836
One basket,
so give him one mal and five doe.

243
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,004
One mal and five doe.

244
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,715
One basket of ocean quahogs
should give them three mal.

245
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,259
But they only get
one mal and five doe per basket.

246
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,260
Yes.

247
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,972
Only half of the profit
goes to the people of this island.

248
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,683
A fifth may be his commission,

249
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,310
but another three-tenths is gone.

250
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,899
Or someone could have embezzled it.

251
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,416
It opened.

252
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,048
I just grilled these.

253
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,676
-Would you like a taste?
-I am all right.

254
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,034
What are you doing?

255
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,870
You cannot do this.

256
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,957
If you are searching his chambers
while he is gone,

257
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,543
I will keep watch.

258
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,418
You have to come out.

259
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,712
People are coming.

260
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,137
"Manwol Island chibuchaek"?

261
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,891
CHIBUCHAEK: A TRANSACTION RECORD
OF MONEY AND GOODS

262
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,522
Where did he embezzle
such great wealth to?

263
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,883
What is this atrocious behavior?

264
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,302
You forced me to let you stay here,

265
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,471
and then you even
went through my chambers!

266
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,391
-I was--
-Leave this island now.

267
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,392
Right now!

268
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,486
What is that?

269
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,030
Manwol Island chibuchaek.

270
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,576
The money he took from and gave
the people of the island is recorded here.

271
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,497
Even if you find something through that,

272
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,873
we have already been kicked out.

273
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,792
Would he even budge?

274
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,211
If he truly defrauded all this money,

275
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,256
he should be
kicked off the island, not us.

276
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,384
We do not have
the right to decide who stays here.

277
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,178
Our mission is to simply bring
Park Gyeong-u to the palace.

278
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,807
You should find
a means to persuade him instead.

279
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,561
No, I do not want to persuade him
to come to the palace.

280
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,982
Now that I found out there is a nobleman
who defrauds the people,

281
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,900
I must right this wrong no matter what.

282
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,486
I will get to the bottom of this.

283
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,950
So if you are going to join me,
give me what you have in your arms.

284
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,676
MANWOL ISLAND CHIBUCHAEK

285
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,399
It is all falling into place now.

286
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,193
Park Gyeong-uâ€¦

287
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,236
What an interesting man.

288
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,210
What was that?

289
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,547
It means I will stick with you to the end.

290
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,474
What is on your mind?

291
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,020
I was thinking about
how I shall deal with the opposition

292
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,523
of the court officials.

293
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:25,821
That will be the last mountain
I must conquer in this contest.

294
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,365
Yes.

295
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,993
You must cross that mountain

296
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,122
to bring back
the true meaning of taekhyeon.

297
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,381
Mother has recovered from her ailment,
so she will not just sit on her hands.

298
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,882
However, this time,

299
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,886
I cannot crown the prince
according to what others want,

300
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,014
but according to
who truly has what it takes.

301
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,275
Goodness, be careful.

302
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,662
Come here kids.

303
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,622
-How nice.
-This tastes good.

304
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,999
This is nice.

305
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,126
Goodness.

306
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,545
-Master.
-We got a lot of ocean quahogs.

307
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,588
You have worked hard.

308
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,464
-Please eat.
-Thank you.

309
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,049
-Thank you.
-Go on.

310
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,217
You have worked hard.

311
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,886
Eat up, everyone.

312
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,847
-Please excuse me.
-Very well.

313
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,015
Go on then.

314
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,689
Why are you still here?

315
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,816
I have unfinished business with you.

316
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,819
Is that so?

317
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,614
Did you not look into me
and search my chambers

318
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,574
because you were suspicious of me?

319
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,243
If you are a corrupt man
who defrauds the people,

320
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,455
we should even search your undergarments
to discern the truth.

321
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,709
So? Did you find anything?

322
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,544
Yes.

323
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,964
You took an excessive amount
of commission from the people

324
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,384
and even pocketed three-tenths more,
according to this book.

325
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,351
Appointing a talent
is like using dishware.

326
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,356
However, you found out
that I have been defrauding the people.

327
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,525
You must discard this broken dish now.

328
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,778
Discarding may be a way,

329
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,614
but we tried putting
the broken pieces together.

330
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,201
Then we finally saw
how you used the defrauded money.

331
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,787
Yes, the commission you took from them

332
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,998
was used to pay off the villagers' debts
to Uichang, the Righteous Granaries.

333
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,045
And today, the village finally paid off
the grains they took out from Uichang.

334
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,799
And the additional three-tenths
you took is right here.

335
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,220
-Goodness, this is good.
-All right now.

336
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,722
You created a cooperative society
with that money.

337
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,393
You helped them open up a store to help
make a living in the low season

338
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,061
when ocean quahogs are not caught.

339
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,232
In the end, the three-tenths you took
became the capital for their independence.

340
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,695
Manwol Island will now do well
even without you.

341
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,154
Yes.

342
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,991
They found economic independence,
just as you wanted.

343
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,577
You are right.

344
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,038
What you two said is right.

345
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,207
However, I have bad news.

346
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,252
I do not wish to work for the King.

347
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,381
What if you are to work for the people,
not for the King?

348
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:39,097
If you come with us,
we will help you implement your theory

349
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,726
for the sake of our people.

350
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,897
So,

351
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,694
please work for other children
of this kingdom who are like Yeon-ji.

352
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,036
You are both bright,
just like your father.

353
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,665
Do you know who our father is?

354
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,929
Very well.

355
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,350
Let us leave
when the sea opens up tomorrow morning.

356
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,819
I send you my children,
the candidates for the next Crown Prince.

357
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,574
Please discern which one of them
is fit to become the next King.

358
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,578
You said you could not be my subject.

359
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,874
But that does not mean you cannot be
the teacher of the Crown Prince.

360
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,878
I ask this of you as a friend.

361
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,142
Grand Prince Seongnam
is not of royal blood?

362
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,602
No.

363
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,106
On top of that,
Her Majesty became pregnant

364
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,150
during the period of mourning
for the late King.

365
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:18,029
If he is not the child of His Majesty,
he should be kicked out of the palace.

366
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,407
This is how we end up losing
yet another grand prince.

367
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,410
It is too early to be relieved.

368
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,912
The final evaluation must be made.

369
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,834
How will the King conduct
the final evaluation?

370
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,379
It must be the same way
as the cohort selection.

371
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,589
That is not likely.

372
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,425
Do you not know what he is like?

373
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,389
He seems so confident,
so it means he must have another plan.

374
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,308
He may have planned something

375
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,477
ever since he decided to
turn the taekhyeon into a contest.

376
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,781
Is this rumor
truly going around the capital?

377
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,658
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:09,456
Yes, it has spread everywhere
from the deep mountains to the palace.

379
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,795
Go through every corner of the capital
and retrieve every single one.

380
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,175
THE LADY WAS IMPREGNATED BY ANOTHER MANâ€¦

381
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,642
The rumor is spreading like wildfire.

382
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,276
Please give my son back!

383
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,451
He is an unlucky prince
who cannot be in our genealogy.

384
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,828
Consider him never to have existed.

385
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,085
Let go of me.

386
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,295
Let go of me!

387
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,048
Let go of me!

388
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,898
The Queen Dowager's confidence

389
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,568
came from this.

390
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,389
I will not leave
before I get the medicine.

391
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,432
I need that medicine right now.

392
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,602
By the way,

393
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,064
what happened to the one who was ill then?

394
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,652
He briefly recovered after that medicine.

395
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,239
But my older brother's illness worsened,
and he passed away.

396
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,657
I see.

397
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,451
So it was for your older brother.

398
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,328
I am sorry.

399
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,581
No.

400
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,209
I got the medicine
thanks to your collateral,

401
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,837
and I got a chance
to talk to him for a short while.

402
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,422
Thank you.

403
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,219
Did you really come to Manwol Island
because of me?

404
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,513
Yes.

405
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,392
I came right away
when I heard that you were here.

406
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,269
Why?

407
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,690
Thump.

408
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,358
Thump.

409
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,862
This is the usual speed of my heartbeat.

410
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,490
But whenever I see youâ€¦

411
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,409
Thump, thump.

412
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,911
Thump, thump.

413
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,121
It beats normally.

414
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,999
What do you mean?

415
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,294
It means I like you.

416
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,810
It is so pretty.

417
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,912
It really is.

418
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,458
When you see

419
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,878
another beautiful sunrise
just like this one,

420
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,881
you will surely think of me, right?

421
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,811
Are we not leaving?

422
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,804
I have to reveal the truth

423
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,806
before Seo Ham-deok arrives at the palace.

424
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,278
Prince Uiseong is returning to Hanseong
with Seo Ham-deok on the palanquin.

425
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,742
I killed a civilian
to make Seo Ham-deok come with me.

426
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,080
However, he is coming under one condition.

427
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,583
Please kill the other inspector
you came with.

428
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,420
We must move quickly.

429
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,507
The Queen Dowager
has a different plan now,

430
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,343
so I must take this chance
to get rid of Grand Prince Gyeseong.

431
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,889
What are you thinking?

432
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,600
If things go wrong
after inflicting harm on a grand prince,

433
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,269
our family will be wiped out.

434
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,523
I cannot let Prince Uiseong
become a murderer.

435
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,651
This is a great chance

436
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,737
to drag the Queen down
along with Grand Prince Gyeseong.

437
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,704
So Father, hurry and send swordsmen
who can keep a secret.

438
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,792
Grand Prince Gyeseong will have chosen
the fastest way back to Hanseong.

439
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,235
Do not inflict the slightest scratch
on his body.

440
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,780
We must catch him alive.

441
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,950
Once the evidence is in my hands,

442
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,244
it is my turn to step up.

443
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,456
I will create a reason
why Grand Prince Gyeseong must die.

444
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,795
What did you just say?

445
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:17,466
I said it is impossible
for Grand Prince Gyeseong to be crowned.

446
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,220
He has a hideous nature

447
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,890
and an immoral heart.

448
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,812
What is the basis of your statement?

449
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,523
There is evidence.

450
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,068
You will know once you see it.

451
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,030
If a letter is found along with his body,

452
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,241
nobody will become suspicious.

453
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:47,622
In the end, Grand Prince Gyeseong
will be known as a prince

454
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,499
who took his own life
because his secret came out.

455
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,629
Once the King finds out his secret,

456
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,632
he will want to cover it up quietly.

457
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,148
Consort Ko.

458
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,067
Show His Majesty the portrait.

459
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,204
How long will you make him wait?

460
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,951
-Your Majesty.
-What brings you here, My Queen?

461
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,372
I came to retrieve
Grand Prince Gyeseong's property.

462
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,668
Consort Ko.

463
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,674
Give that to me.

464
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,808
Give it to me now.

465
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,728
What in the world is that thing?

466
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,358
It is nothing, Your Majesty.

467
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,694
What do you mean, it is nothing?

468
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,615
How long will you try to hide
Grand Prince Gyeseong's hideous secret?

469
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,452
Hideous secret?

470
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,164
What do you think this is
for you to say something so absurd?

471
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,134
This is a portrait
of Grand Prince Gyeseong as a woman.

472
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,054
He is only a man on the outside.

473
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,597
He is a woman at heart.

474
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,269
Consort Hwang.

475
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,565
If you fail to prove what you just said,

476
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,568
I will never

477
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,072
forgive you.

478
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,493
Very well.

479
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,620
But if what I said is true,

480
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,040
hold him accountable
for bringing disgrace on the royal court,

481
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,628
as well as the Queen
who bore him, brought him up,

482
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,340
and yet failed to rectify
his hideous heart, Your Majesty.

483
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,350
Bring it to me.

484
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,108
Now!

485
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,180
Consort Hwang, explain this.

486
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,100
How is this painting related
to Grand Prince Gyeseong in any way?

487
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,562
I know the contest is fierce,

488
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,231
but how dare you slander him like this?

489
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,484
Your Majesty, it is not like that.

490
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,655
I will not condone this incident.

491
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,201
Your Majesty.

492
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,872
May I punish Consort Hwang

493
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,210
according to the rules
of the ladies of the royal palace?

494
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,129
You may do that.

495
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,926
Let us go.

496
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,628
Where is that portrait?

497
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,964
Where did you put it?

498
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,132
Consort Hwang.

499
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,302
What are you talking about?

500
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,102
The portrait of Grand Prince Gyeseong
as a woman!

501
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,895
Have you gone insane?

502
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,898
How could you say something so atrocious?

503
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,818
Also, Consort Hwang,

504
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,695
we are both first junior consorts.

505
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,739
Show some courtesy.

506
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,798
Are you finally awake?

507
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,676
Are you all right?

508
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,013
What happened?

509
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,059
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

510
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,353
I have put
Grand Prince Gyeseong in danger.

511
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,314
What do you mean?

512
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,360
I revealed his secret to Consort Hwang.

513
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,863
You must hurry.

514
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,615
His life is in danger.

515
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,119
Consort Ko, you must
switch out the portrait first.

516
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,329
Yes, Your Majesty.

517
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,711
You must save
Grand Prince Gyeseong. Hurry.

518
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,422
And Court Lady Shin.

519
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,424
Find out what Consort Hwang is up to.

520
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,165
The Queen Dowager
and Chief State Councilor

521
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,959
know about you.

522
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,632
Many people in the palace found out.

523
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,345
You must

524
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,306
hide this for the rest of your life.

525
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,351
Soâ€¦

526
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,978
please hide here

527
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,606
until you fully recover.

528
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,528
No.

529
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,405
I have no time to be here.

530
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,907
Seo Ham-deok
is about to begin a rebellion.

531
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,368
I must inform Father of this immediately.

532
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,456
He already knows.

533
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,506
Hear, Seo Ham-deok.

534
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,218
I wish to appoint you as the head
of the Royal Commandery Division.

535
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,636
Do you accept?

536
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,223
I receive your boundless grace.

537
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,269
Father, please recant your royal command.

538
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:35,232
During the mission, I witnessed
Seo Ham-deok's plan for treason.

539
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:39,027
He is a rebel who gathered monks
in an attempt to start a rebellion.

540
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,071
A rebel? Impossible, Your Majesty.

541
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,698
Shut your mouth!

542
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,992
Arrest the rebel, Seo Ham-deok!

543
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,202
Your Majesty, I am not a rebel.

544
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,913
I am not a rebel, Your Majesty.

545
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,290
Your Majesty!

546
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,916
I am being framed!

547
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,168
This is slander!

548
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,545
Let go of me!

549
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,005
Your Majesty!

550
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,592
I wanted to arrest him in Mount Gyeryong,

551
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,720
but I wanted to complete my mission
and bring him to the palace,

552
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,638
so I had to hide it until this moment.

553
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,974
Prince Uiseong.

554
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,352
Yes, Father.

555
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,271
If you had known Seo Ham-deok was a rebel,

556
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,857
even if bringing him was your mission,

557
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,569
you should not have brought him
before me, the King.

558
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:25,949
I apologize.

559
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,372
Seo Ham-deok was arrested?

560
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,540
Yes.

561
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,751
The King already noticed
and brought him in.

562
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,752
The King?

563
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,713
Does this mean everything was a trap?

564
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,175
If Seo Ham-deok was caught,

565
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,761
it means it is a matter of time
before we are exposed.

566
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,054
Yes.

567
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,892
We may also be in peril
if he gets tortured and reveals it all.

568
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,064
Find out where Seo Ham-deok is confined
and who is interrogating him.

569
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,942
You must move discreetly.

570
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:00,984
Yes.

571
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,283
You have done well.

572
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,422
It has been a while.

573
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,934
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

574
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,690
Very well.

575
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,653
Between the two princes,
whose royal edict did you accept?

576
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,172
GRAND PRINCE GYESEONG

577
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:37,456
PRINCE UISEONG,
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM, PRINCE BOGEOM

578
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,250
Mother.

579
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,762
Thank you.

580
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,474
You have done well.

581
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,770
Please tell me I have done well
after the contest is all over.

582
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,025
Very well.

583
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,027
I will.

584
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,620
By any chance, have you all seen it?

585
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,122
Only the identification plaque
of Grand Prince Gyeseong is gone.

586
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:23,168
Oh, my. Then Prince Uiseong
must have won in Mount Gyeryong.

587
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,797
By the way,
has Grand Prince Gyeseong returned?

588
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,173
I have not seen him here.

589
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,678
Well, I guess it is
taking a while for him to return.

590
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,055
That young man must have
many things he wants to do

591
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,890
outside of the palace.

592
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,356
What is taking so long?

593
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,653
The decision has been made.

594
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,322
Both Prince Bogeom
and Grand Prince Seongnam made it.

595
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,617
Congratulations, Your Grace.

596
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,120
Prince Bogeomâ€¦

597
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:01,373
Does that mean a total of three princes
are up for the final evaluation?

598
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,793
Yes, Prince Bogeom, Grand Prince Seongnam,
and Prince Uiseong are up.

599
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,380
I am so proud of my son.

600
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:14,010
But from now on, the contest will depend
on their power, not competence.

601
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,139
Prince Bogeom could become the cohort,
but could he really be crowned?

602
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,350
Then what must I do now?

603
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,769
Before we discuss that,
you must all come now.

604
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,230
Why have all ladies
of the royal palace been called?

605
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,523
What is going on?

606
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:51,256
As of today, the rank
of Cho-yeon of the Hwang family

607
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,009
shall be demoted

608
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:58,054
from first junior consort
to fourth junior consort.

609
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,724
Fourth junior consort?

610
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:02,893
Fourth junior consort?

611
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,270
That is the lowest rank among concubines.

612
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,522
Oh, my, what is going on?

613
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,233
Your Majesty.

614
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,820
You cannot do this.

615
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,032
Your slandering and defaming
of the Grand Prince

616
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,159
should be paid for with your death.

617
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,121
But I am showing you mercy,

618
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,041
for you are the mother of Prince Uiseong,
Fourth Junior Consort Hwang.

619
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,306
It is not that I cannot kill you.

620
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,934
I choose not to.

621
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,522
I only wish to keep my son's secret.

622
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,735
Fourth Junior Consort Hwang.

623
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,739
How did you end up like this?

624
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,245
How dare you?

625
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:50,000
How dare you look a Third Junior Consort
right in the eyes, Fourth Junior Consort?

626
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,379
You must abide by the royal customs
and treat me with respect from now on.

627
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,997
Mother, calm down.

628
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,507
I will make sure I repay them
for this humiliation.

629
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,305
You must

630
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,808
become the Crown Prince.

631
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:54,731
Yes, Mother.

632
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,859
I will be crowned

633
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,612
and return you to your rightful position.

634
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,713
This is a forged letter found at the scene

635
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,674
where Grand Prince Gyeseong
supposedly took his life.

636
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,509
However,

637
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,263
the handwriting of this letter

638
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,351
was confirmed
as your writing, Court Lady Nam.

639
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,690
Who was it?

640
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,652
Tell me who gave you the order
to forge this note right now.

641
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,406
If you do not,
not only will I take your life,

642
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,617
but the one you serve
will also be put in danger.

643
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,412
It was not me.

644
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,163
Someone else

645
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,750
has imitated my handwriting.

646
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,335
Open the doors.

647
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:01,840
What do you think you are doing, Queen?

648
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,685
I was expecting you.

649
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,353
Court Lady Nam.

650
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,313
Tell me what happened.

651
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:18,982
Your Royal Highness.

652
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,777
That letter was written in my handwriting.

653
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,655
But I have not done such a thing.

654
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,032
Your Majesty.

655
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,368
What kind of a trick are you playing?

656
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,413
You may all leave.

657
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,165
Yes, Your Majesty.

658
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:49,262
Yes, I have played a little trick.

659
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,849
I changed it
with Court Lady Nam's handwriting.

660
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,354
What are you trying to do?

661
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:03,193
How can the Queen use such a cheap trick
like a lowly scoundrel?

662
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,737
I am only returning
what I have learned from you.

663
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,822
You have framed

664
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,992
the Chief State Councilor

665
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,537
for your attempted murder
of Grand Prince Seongnam.

666
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,331
Therefore,

667
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,751
I only turned

668
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,922
what the Chief State Councilor did

669
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,801
to Grand Prince Gyeseong into your doing.

670
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:31,679
I did not know you would
resort to such a lowly way, Queen.

671
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,933
When you created those slanderous papers
about Grand Prince Seongnam,

672
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,520
you should have been ready to face this.

673
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,814
What is it

674
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,775
that you want?

675
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,952
Now,

676
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,538
would youâ€¦

677
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,791
like to hear my offer?

678
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,085
Your Majesty.

679
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,755
We must now begin the final evaluation.

680
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,173
The evaluation

681
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,468
will not be held here.

682
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,138
I summoned you here today

683
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,391
for the unity
of the Crown Prince's tutors.

684
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,479
In that case,

685
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:25,692
who are the evaluators and where
will the final evaluation be held?

686
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,789
The final evaluation of the taekhyeon

687
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,711
will be made by the Confucian scholars
of Sungkyunkwan.

688
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:48,089
-That is implausible, Your Majesty.
-That is implausible, Your Majesty.

689
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,008
The scholars of Sungkyunkwan?

690
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:54,137
How could you leave the evaluation
to those young scholars?

691
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,056
This is impossible, Your Majesty.

692
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:02,395
What do you think, Chief State Councilor?

693
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:08,526
It is said that a subject
is the mirror image of a king.

694
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,988
So although I found out about your crime,

695
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,200
how could I put all the blame on you?

696
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,372
Do you not think it will be a fair fight

697
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,001
even if the scholars evaluate them?

698
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:34,802
I believe it is right
to do this your way, Your Majesty.

699
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,181
It was your decision

700
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:42,435
to begin a contest
as a means of the taekhyeon.

701
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,773
Chief State Councilor,
why are you doing this?

702
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,944
What do you think, Minister Yoon?

703
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:56,658
I cannot say there is no concern
as this is a novel method.

704
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,828
But I do think it is worth a try.

705
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,833
If there is any opposition,

706
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,461
you must speak up now.

707
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,063
The scholars have all gathered.

708
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,233
I see.

709
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,944
Things will become quite busy.

710
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,113
Your Majesty.

711
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:38,866
Since when did he plan on leaving
the decision to the scholars?

712
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,999
Are you saying

713
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,501
you will leave the final evaluation
to the scholars?

714
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,460
Yes.

715
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,298
They are the ones
who can come to a decision

716
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,842
without taking a side.

717
00:59:55,925 --> 01:00:00,513
They are the furthest away
from vested interests and politics.

718
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,934
But most of them
are the sons of court officials

719
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,061
or those who are involved in some way.

720
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,276
It is impossible, even for those scholars,
to be freed from such interests.

721
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:18,448
However, they will become
the subjects of the next King.

722
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:24,287
Hence, he is trying to let them
choose the King themselves.

723
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,041
If things go as planned,

724
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,294
Grand Prince Seongnam will avoid
a disadvantageous situation.

725
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,254
That way,

726
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,049
no matter what the result is,

727
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,010
I will be able to accept it.

728
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:44,432
But the Queen Dowager and the officials
will not leave them alone.

729
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,351
They will make an attempt to reach them.

730
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,811
Of course.

731
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:50,897
However,

732
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:55,610
nobody can leave that place

733
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,238
until the Crown Prince is decided.

734
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,057
PRINCE UISEONG

735
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,600
GRAND PRINCE SEONGNAM

736
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,143
PRINCE BOGEOM

737
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,416
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

738
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:27,326
You have come far by showing
great performance during the contest.

739
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:31,581
Either Prince Uiseong or Prince Bogeom
should remain in the contest.

740
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:35,877
It is advantageous for us
to let them compete against each other.

741
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,380
We need to make that person
stand on our side.

742
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,759
This is the only way
to get the scholars to turn their backs.

743
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:46,304
From now on, the general opinion
of the scholars will fluctuate.

744
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,389
Please choose Prince Uiseong.

745
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,600
I cannot accept it

746
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,393
if I lose like this.

747
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:58,399
