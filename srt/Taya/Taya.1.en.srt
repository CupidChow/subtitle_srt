1
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:29,013
Sixto...

2
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,826
This is what you want, isn't it?

3
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,251
I dreamt about you again.

4
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,750
I see you everywhere.

5
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:16,172
Even in my dreams.

6
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,191
Or is this a nightmare?

7
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:42,119
Goddamnit.

8
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,418
It's been a year since I first saw you.

9
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:52,633
You walked in front of me.

10
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,672
I could you feel you pulling me in.

11
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:59,207
That time, you left me something
more than your smile.

12
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,709
I saw you at the library a few times.

13
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:09,240
It seems as if fated by chance

14
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:13,737
that you pull me towards you
like a magnet.

15
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,496
Inside or outside the school,

16
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:25,809
I keep running into you.

17
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:29,393
I didn't know we ate at
the same noodle cart.

18
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,847
I remember you'd always
ask for extra tendons.

19
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:36,476
Mister, can you add more tendons?

20
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:42,379
Since then, I couldn't get
you out of my mind.

21
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,933
I want to talk to you but
I don't have the guts.

22
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:51,327
It's probably why
you're everywhere I look.

23
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,263
I can't even work up
the courage to ask your name.

24
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:02,308
I just rely on a book of baby
names to assign you one.

25
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,602
This one.

26
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:07,590
Winona.

27
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:38,597
Sixto! What are you doing?

28
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:41,324
That faucet has been
running all morning!

29
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,031
Are you trying to fill up the toilet?

30
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,223
I'm almost done, uncle.

31
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,870
You darned kid, shit.

32
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:49,781
Stop masturbating.

33
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:51,387
I gotta crap!

34
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:52,806
Uncle, I wasn't mastur—

35
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:02,597
Sixto!

36
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,139
You darned kid!

37
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,680
Stop beating off.

38
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:10,539
It weakens the body.

39
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:12,223
I wasn't beating off.

40
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:13,604
If you say so.

41
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:17,198
Will you be home early or
do you have a shoot?

42
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:19,306
I don't know yet. Why?

43
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:23,199
I'm going out. Just lock the door.
I have my own key.

44
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:24,756
Okay, uncle.

45
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,769
I'll manage.

46
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,034
Mister! Here's my fare.

47
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:01,973
Please pass the fare.

48
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:13,814
Sheesh, the old maniac...

49
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,198
What the hell!

50
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,791
Pervert!

51
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:18,972
Mister, pull over!

52
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:23,206
I'll go ahead.

53
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,709
Corpuz.

54
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:40,131
I gave you a passing grade in Research I
because you begged me

55
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:43,323
and said you can't afford
to fail another subject.

56
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:48,903
Even without a good research topic,
I let you advance to Research II.

57
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:50,899
Yes, sir..

58
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,837
What was that you showed me?

59
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:57,983
I've seen all of those gimmicks!

60
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,520
Families that live in cemeteries,

61
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:03,589
two straight young men who
fell in love with each other,

62
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:06,627
the life of elderly photographers
in Luneta.

63
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:08,082
What's new?

64
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,517
Especially that other one.

65
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,313
Life of a macho dancer.

66
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,326
Are there still macho dancers
in the age of Alter?

67
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:18,772
Alter, sir?

68
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,550
It's a hidden world in social media.

69
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:24,499
You might check it out.
I don't want to impose.

70
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,522
You might find this one corny...

71
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,721
but what do you really
want out of life?

72
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,438
What's your passion?

73
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,944
Work on that!

74
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:36,119
What's your deepest desire?

75
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:37,877
What are you crazy about?

76
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,563
Right now, all I'm crazy
about is Nona.

77
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,938
You want me to do a documentary
on her, Sir Agulto?

78
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,410
Hey, Corpuz!

79
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:47,937
Sir.

80
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:49,116
Are you listening to me?

81
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,405
Yes, sir.

82
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:55,643
Start working on it.

83
00:08:56,271 --> 00:09:00,730
I want to see you graduate
because I am so sick of you.

84
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:04,209
And one more thing, rent
a better camera and mic.

85
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:08,637
It's so hard to hear and make out
any images in your work.

86
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,150
Excuse me, sir.
Dean asked for you.

87
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,290
Okay. I'll be right in.

88
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,962
You better come up with something.

89
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,889
Good day, Dean.

90
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,254
Sit down.

91
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:42,994
Sir Agulto, have you even read
your students' evaluations?

92
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:45,755
Why do I have to, Dean?

93
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:48,814
My job is not to please students,
but to teach.

94
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,932
That's the thing.

95
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:54,100
It says here in one of your evaluations:

96
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:57,353
Sir Agulto does not teach.

97
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:00,521
It says here you just put
a random movie on,

98
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:04,146
then you spend the rest of
the class snoozing in the back.

99
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:09,674
Sir, this is your second time
failing students' evaluation.

100
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:14,896
You don't want to take on additional units,
you don't want research time.

101
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,713
What's seems to be the problem, sir?

102
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:20,009
Come on. Help me to help you!

103
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:24,959
I want to promote you, as you requested,
but how? What's my basis?

104
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:28,234
How about loyalty
to the university, sir?

105
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,651
We have plenty of loyal faculty.

106
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:34,759
And most of them are young,

107
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:39,908
hungry, passionate, good in evaluation,
good in performance!

108
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,859
Sir, I really miss your old performance.

109
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:48,150
Every year, you used to produce
good and interesting documentaries.

110
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:52,776
And I believe that you still have that
fire and passion inside of you!

111
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,729
Come on. Give me something.

112
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:58,818
So I can promote you.

113
00:11:03,484 --> 00:11:07,192
Bro. Our groupmate is such a hassle.

114
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:08,674
He's so useless.

115
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:10,275
Who is it?

116
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:11,442
Is it Corpuz?

117
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,550
Yes, dude. That's him.

118
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,417
That Sixto shit, bro.

119
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,068
Right.

120
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:20,459
It's amazing how he's
both lazy and stupid!

121
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:22,526
More stupid than you?

122
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,943
How old do you think he is, dude?

123
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,556
30?

124
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:32,542
- 30? Get out of here
- He's 35! He can't be 30.

125
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,417
The son of a bitch looks 35.

126
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:36,916
But damn, what an idiot.

127
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:40,375
He's too old to still be in school!

128
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,691
What did you say?

129
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:30,776
Ma. Maybe you have some
change lying around.

130
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:33,697
Change? 5,000?

131
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,196
Since when is 5,000
considered change?

132
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,860
Didn't I just send
you your allowance?

133
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:45,835
I rented a camera but my adviser
didn't like my work.

134
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:48,377
Now I have to do it all over again.

135
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,262
Has your uncle paid you yet?

136
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,231
He told me he'll try next week.

137
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,859
Okay, I'll see if there's someone
I can borrow from.

138
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:04,692
Darling, I wish you'd finally
graduate this year.

139
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,509
So you can start looking for a job.

140
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,026
I told you, Ma.

141
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:13,067
I could have finished my
studies there in the province.

142
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:18,392
Now I'm three years delayed.

143
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:20,791
I could have been working by now.

144
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,400
You just put it all on me.

145
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,400
You're already there.
Just finish what you started.

146
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:29,175
Anyway, I'll just text you when
I've borrowed some cash.

147
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:30,692
Okay, Ma.

148
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:31,734
Thank you.

149
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:50,455
Hey! Bro!

150
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,275
Long time no see!

151
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:53,651
Are you going back to school?

152
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:56,258
You think I'm ever coming
back to this school? No way.

153
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,651
Looks like you've hit it big!

154
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,476
What are you talking about?
It's no biggie.

155
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:02,793
It's the same old me!

156
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:03,984
What are you doing here?

157
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,084
Here to get your transcript?

158
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:06,809
No. It's all failed anyway.

159
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:09,876
I'm just remembering the place where
I wasted five years of my life.

160
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:10,935
Shit.

161
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,876
Wait, what are you still doing here?

162
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:14,542
Weren't you supposed to
graduate last year?

163
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,562
No, man. I failed two subjects.

164
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:19,788
And I still have my thesis.

165
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,261
Short film?

166
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:24,334
I chose to do a documentary.
It's such a hassle.

167
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:29,247
I used up all my money renting
lights and a camera.

168
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:34,140
Get a load of this guy.

169
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:37,583
You're pathetic. You still don't
have your own camera?

170
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,419
You're making fun of me.

171
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:40,727
I'll lend you mine.

172
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:41,436
Really?

173
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,919
I'll lend you everything.
Everything you need!

174
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,894
Look at you, Mr. Bigtime!

175
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,835
Not at all.

176
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,461
But wait, do you still have a class?

177
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:49,736
No, I'm done for the day.

178
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:52,602
Come with me.
We're going to eat.

179
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:53,877
Let's hang out at my place.

180
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:56,287
I'll make you happy, boy!

181
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:01,627
Hey! Forget about the cash!
It's my treat, fool!

182
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,419
Come on.

183
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,894
You've really hit it big.

184
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,002
Give me your plate.

185
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:12,566
Here. Then place it on a lettuce.

186
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,674
There you go. Eat up.

187
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:15,866
This is how you eat this.
Watch me.

188
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:26,319
You got it.

189
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:34,609
Jeez! Here, drink up.

190
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,519
Drink this. Drink it.

191
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,378
- What's this?
- Just drink it.

192
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,652
Damn, man!

193
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:43,577
That's Soju. It's good.

194
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:45,281
What did I tell you?

195
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,461
Keep eating.

196
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,882
What are you working on right now?

197
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,860
Maybe I can tag along.

198
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,795
Are you still doing WCF?

199
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:54,127
WCF?

200
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,710
Weddings, Christenings,
and Funerals? Hell no!

201
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,294
I'm earning peanuts there.

202
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,503
Hey, listen up. I'm telling you now.

203
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,294
Your last year in school,
forget about it.

204
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:05,763
It won't do you any good.

205
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:08,002
You'll have no use for
what you learn in there.

206
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,503
Look at me! I'm not using
what I learned in school!

207
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:12,378
But I'm earning big bucks.

208
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:16,169
What's your gimmick then?

209
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:17,752
Don't tell me it's networking!

210
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,959
Easier than networking!

211
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:22,294
You want to know?

212
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:23,835
Of course I do!

213
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,294
Online ending.

214
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,764
See those posts?

215
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,439
Those were posted by
the agents of online ending.

216
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:44,101
Whatever you're into, pretty sure
they're taking bets for it.

217
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:45,962
Scroll down.

218
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,044
Right there. See that guitar?

219
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:50,673
That's a limited edition.

220
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,520
There's only fifty of those
guitars in the world.

221
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,187
- Really?
- Yeah, you can bet on it for 5,000.

222
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:58,144
It plays out like a normal ending.

223
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:02,778
You just have to guess the last two
numbers of the game's ending.

224
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:04,560
But don't get confused, alright.

225
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:10,169
You might mistake the ending of
a game for the ending of a quarter.

226
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,461
We have everything!
Whatever you want.

227
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,544
You want a gun? Poppers?

228
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:20,961
Party drugs, shrooms,
crack, weed, anything!

229
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,503
How do you earn from this?

230
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:24,877
I'm one of the agents of O.E.M.

231
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,419
O.E.M.?

232
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:30,353
Online Ending Movement.

233
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,835
All movement, we handle
bets for everything.

234
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:36,461
Cockfights, spider fights, color game.

235
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:39,144
We even make vloggers
quarrel against each other.

236
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:40,070
Check it out.

237
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:45,144
We go to places where
we can spot prospects.

238
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,228
Like schools and call centers.

239
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,968
Call center agents love to play.

240
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:57,378
I'll recruit the prospect into the group
then I let them get addicted.

241
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,544
That's how we earn.

242
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:05,044
Every time they pour
cash into it and lose,

243
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:07,852
that's where us agents get our cut.

244
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:10,211
But I need to be careful
with my prospects.

245
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,394
You never know, they might
rat us out to the police.

246
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,253
I'll get whipped by my T.L.

247
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:15,127
T.L?

248
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:18,097
T.L. as in Team Leader.

249
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:19,419
This is how it works.

250
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:24,028
All agents surrender
90 percent of their cut to them.

251
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:30,961
And from the TL, that 90 percent
goes to Boss Paps.

252
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:32,374
Boss Paps?

253
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,977
You have too many questions!

254
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:38,044
All you have to know is,
Boss Paps runs this whole joint!

255
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:44,297
300? To win an alcohol bottle?

256
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:46,384
Dumbass! That's just a code.

257
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,790
See that girl holding the alcohol?

258
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:50,087
Pretty sweet, huh?

259
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:52,009
- Yeah, bro.
- That's your prize.

260
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:53,489
Yeah right?

261
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:55,280
Why is she holding a product?

262
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:56,739
It's a code.

263
00:18:56,905 --> 00:19:00,822
That's how the bettor remembers
what he's going to get.

264
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:02,797
Neat huh?

265
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:05,014
- Pretty neat.
- Great!

266
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,905
I want these too!

267
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,631
There's what you came for.

268
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:24,239
Tripod and Deadcat.
You can have all of it.

269
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,847
I'm fine with whatever
you can spare, bro.

270
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:29,714
If I may ask, bro.

271
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:34,005
Why do you have these video equipment
if you don't need them for your work?

272
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,986
I'm getting rid of
all this little by little.

273
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:37,303
See that bike?

274
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:44,033
All of it, even my toy collections—
shoes, all of it!

275
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:46,364
Everything you see.

276
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:49,030
Even my musical instruments.

277
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,681
This whole thing.

278
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:54,736
Everything in here were shit
I couldn't afford to buy before.

279
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:56,956
So when I got a taste of power,

280
00:19:57,395 --> 00:20:00,353
got a bit of cash, I went
on a shopping spree!

281
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:03,470
Damn, I wish I could have
my own stuff someday.

282
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:07,197
Don't worry, I'll ask my boss if
we have an opening for you.

283
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,781
If we need a spot filled in,
you'll be the first to know.

284
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:10,587
Hell yeah!

285
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,739
- You're the best!
- I got you!

286
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:14,614
- Beer?
- No, no, I'm good.

287
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:17,306
No, we have beers here.
Whatever you like.

288
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:19,130
We have weed.

289
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:20,988
I have cocaine, too.

290
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:22,563
This one.

291
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:23,777
What's that?

292
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,697
Acid.

293
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:28,621
Once you try that one,

294
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,341
you'll feel like you're speaking to God.

295
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:37,056
It's as if your whole body's
slowly lifting up to heaven

296
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:40,506
while you're spinning like that

297
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,863
and you feel all of God's
love envelop you.

298
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:49,737
We'll give it a go next time.

299
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,320
No, let's try it now.

300
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:52,934
You want to?

301
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,106
Nah, I'm good with
the camera for now.

302
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,795
Thanks for this.

303
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,629
- I appreciate it.
- You sure?

304
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:02,880
Don't tell me you've
gotten addicted.

305
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:05,611
No way, I'm just a victim.

306
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,648
TL, I didn't know it was you!

307
00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:58,705
Want some softdrinks? You even
brought backup dancers.

308
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:00,922
Where's the money?

309
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:05,673
Business is bad lately, TL.

310
00:22:06,564 --> 00:22:08,481
Ha! But you have enough
for your vices?

311
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:10,297
Is this where our money's going?

312
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,547
No, TL. That's from a different gig.

313
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:14,280
Besides, it's not a vice.

314
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:18,970
You see, Boss Paps has
been waiting for you.

315
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:22,697
The truth is, he misses
you very much.

316
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:24,714
I don't miss him.

317
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,155
Let's go!

318
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:28,230
Hang on! Where are we going?

319
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:29,339
Hey! Hey!

320
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:31,130
Where are you taking me?

321
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:34,672
Happy birthday to you!

322
00:22:34,697 --> 00:22:36,172
TL!

323
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:37,297
Dude!

324
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,572
TL! We're bros, aren't we?

325
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:42,322
You don't have to do this!

326
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,528
Damn it!

327
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:46,042
Boss Paps!

328
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,111
You have a visitor.

329
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:50,447
He missed you.

330
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,447
Oh, hey. How's our number
one agent, hm?

331
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:02,680
You've been down on
your luck for months.

332
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:06,750
That's not true, Boss Paps,
I just got bills to pay.

333
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:08,692
This shithead's got an expensive habit.

334
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:13,322
Don't be like that.

335
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:19,772
Don't spend your profits.

336
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:24,365
That's for the ending prize.

337
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,697
Are you the one placing bets?

338
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,869
No, Boss Paps.

339
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:31,270
Are you the one winning?

340
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:39,113
No, Boss Paps. It's tough to find
prospective bettors these days.

341
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:44,311
So instead of handing over what I'm due,
you spend it on your little hobbies?

342
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:48,775
I'll tell you something-
when I was a kid,

343
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:51,489
we sold ice candy.

344
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:53,715
However,

345
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,916
I would eat up all of it.

346
00:23:58,794 --> 00:23:59,544
So obviously,

347
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,433
my mother would beat me up.

348
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:07,486
With a cane, hanger, belt- everything
she could get her hands on.

349
00:24:08,505 --> 00:24:11,720
Boss Paps, I'll make up
for it by next month.

350
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,961
That lesson really stayed with me.

351
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,019
You know what my father
used to say? Huh?

352
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:25,697
My father would always say,

353
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:35,629
I really take after my mother.

354
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,028
Especially her violence.

355
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:40,739
It hurts!

356
00:24:56,947 --> 00:24:59,030
I'll make it up to you!
Boss Paps!

357
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:05,360
In two weeks, you will give me
back what you owe me.

358
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:07,436
Two weeks.

359
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,220
How much do you owe me?

360
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:13,290
200 thousand, Boss Paps.

361
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:15,072
You're right.

362
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:18,970
500 thousand.

363
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:21,165
Boss Paps—

364
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:23,824
Boss!

365
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:30,173
That's enough.
Wipe your tears.

366
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,298
Thanks for your visit.

367
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,556
Let's go.

368
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,084
Dear, I borrowed some money.

369
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:25,314
I deposited five thousand
into your account.

370
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:28,614
Thank you, Ma!

371
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:34,828
Bro! Your camera's the best.

372
00:26:34,853 --> 00:26:35,936
The quality is great.

373
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,756
I bet the images will look even better
after lighting the scene.

374
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:39,720
Of course.

375
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:42,060
Take care of it. I'm just
loaning it to you.

376
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,513
You got it.

377
00:26:43,656 --> 00:26:46,947
I spoke with my boss,
by the way.

378
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,005
I can't get you in yet.

379
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,905
I'll let you know if
there's an opening.

380
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:55,339
That's a shame. I can bring in
a lot of prospects for you.

381
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,380
Well, then, you might know some
folks who want to join the group.

382
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,858
Let's have them play and
I'll give you a percentage.

383
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:02,965
You'll get a cut.

384
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:06,611
Okay, bro. I'll update you
when I find someone.

385
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,047
Just make sure to choose someone
who won't sing to the police.

386
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:14,322
I'll give you a cut, don't worry.

387
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:18,049
Sounds good, bro.
Thanks again for the camera.

388
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:19,880
Hurry up with your thesis!

389
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:23,405
School just gets in the
way of earning cash!

390
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,162
I'll do that, Bro. Thanks again.

391
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,822
Alright. Be safe.

392
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:43,531
2,000?

393
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,614
Is this for real?

394
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:16,307
Nona?

395
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:22,228
Will you bet on me?

396
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,478
Nona?

397
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:30,447
Am I not worth spending money on?

398
00:28:31,113 --> 00:28:32,364
Is this for real?

399
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:38,042
What if I go home with
a bucket of biscuits?

400
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:42,409
Do I look like a scam?

401
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,603
You're not a scam, right?

402
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:14,724
Sir!

403
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,100
Sir!

404
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:19,687
Yes, Mr. Corpuz.

405
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:21,225
Have you found a good topic yet?

406
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,339
I discovered something new, sir.

407
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,682
Online Ending.

408
00:31:25,474 --> 00:31:26,350
Ending?

409
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:27,532
As in basketball?

410
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:28,516
Yes, sir!

411
00:31:28,766 --> 00:31:32,308
The way it works is people
place bets online.

412
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:36,141
But it's being used for shady transactions
like drug-dealing, prostitution.

413
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:39,891
You can win a motorcycle,
a gun, anything!

414
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,141
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir!

415
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,707
It's the first time
I'm hearing about it.

416
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,693
Well, send me some
initial clips, okay?

417
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:53,093
Including your case studies so
I can approve it immediately.

418
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:54,308
Yes, sir.

419
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:55,616
I like the sound of it.

420
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:56,532
Thank you, sir.

421
00:31:56,557 --> 00:31:58,016
You may have found your direction.

422
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:58,974
Thank you, sir.

423
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,485
I'll pass all my requirements
right away.

424
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:03,266
Thank you, sir!

425
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:18,802
Uncle!

426
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:23,575
You're home early.

427
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:27,198
Get some food.

428
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:30,200
After you eat, mind the shop.

429
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:31,724
Sure, Uncle. I'll be here.

430
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:46,589
I didn't know you liked basketball.

431
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:58,213
That's it!

432
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,395
Hey!

433
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:01,016
What happened to you?

434
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,948
Ah, nothing.
It's just the game.

435
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:22,627
That was sick.

436
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:24,016
Sick move, that was.

437
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:27,229
Do it!

438
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:47,849
- I won!
- Hey! What's happening?

439
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:49,347
Uncle! They won!

440
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:50,836
Which one?

441
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:51,933
Look, Uncle.

442
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,140
You're not a scam, right?

443
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:08,225
Hello. I'm the winner of
the August 6 game.

444
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:11,225
How do I claim my prize?

445
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,699
They're just busy.
Just busy, Sixto.

446
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:29,393
Bug them later.

447
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:37,141
Did I get duped?

448
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:50,808
Hey you, did you scam me?
How do I claim my prize?

449
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,653
Son of a bitch!

450
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:05,075
The call cannot be
completed as dialed.

451
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,141
Please check the number
and dial again.

452
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:09,100
Shit!

453
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:32,016
What's wrong? You're pissed
so early in the morning.

454
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,266
You don't like the food?

455
00:35:36,148 --> 00:35:40,636
If you don't want that,
you don't have a choice.

456
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,151
Sorry, uncle. Just bothered
about something.

457
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:46,974
Is it about your mother?

458
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:51,362
Don't feel too bad when your mother
isn't able to send money.

459
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:54,866
You know how difficult
life is in the province.

460
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:57,616
Look how bad we have it here.

461
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,200
If your mother can't send you cash

462
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:03,991
for your camera or your other expenses,

463
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:06,741
don't give her a hard time for it.

464
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,599
We'll find a way!

465
00:36:10,898 --> 00:36:11,940
Let's eat!

466
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:21,075
Hello.

467
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,991
Hello?

468
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,075
Who is this?

469
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:25,872
Where do you want
the prize delivered?

470
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:28,440
Where do you want to meet up?

471
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:29,949
Nona?

472
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:32,350
Just text me where.

473
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:59,116
Hello? If there's a visitor,

474
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,844
please let them come up
to the room right away.

475
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:02,736
It's room 69.

476
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:04,058
Thank you!

477
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:26,641
Hi, I'm Sixto.

478
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:31,445
Hi, I'm Sixto.

479
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:36,557
Hang on!

480
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:38,544
I'm coming!

481
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:49,643
Close the door.

482
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,283
So? What are you waiting for?

483
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:00,794
Let's get this over with.

484
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:03,016
Who are you again?

485
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:06,001
Why, did I walk into
the wrong room?

486
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:07,428
Aren't you the winner?

487
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:09,250
That's me, but—

488
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,616
You weren't the one I bet on.

489
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:12,766
Oh?

490
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:15,500
Let me check.

491
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:16,612
What's that?

492
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:21,084
Is this the product in the post?

493
00:38:21,354 --> 00:38:22,309
It's not you.

494
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,042
I bet on Happy Time.

495
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:26,600
The bucket of biscuits.

496
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:27,917
This one.

497
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,275
Do you know her?

498
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:32,386
No.

499
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:35,441
She's probably one
of our freelancers.

500
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,209
I'm a permanent employee.

501
00:38:37,326 --> 00:38:38,451
Freelancer?

502
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,917
Here, I'll show you.

503
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,000
It's not you. Like I said.

504
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,484
You're not the one I want.

505
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,167
I need a refund.

506
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:52,834
Who can I talk to?

507
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,543
Refund?!

508
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,418
Go! If you think you can
stand up to a syndicate.

509
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:01,392
If you don't want me,
then I'll leave.

510
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:03,805
There are others who
are lusting over me.

511
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:08,034
Hey, hey, not so fast.

512
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:12,073
Fine. We might as well do it.

513
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,087
Nanette.

514
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:21,969
Sixto.

515
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:44,042
Hurry up, would you?

516
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:58,668
You said a syndicate is running
this online ending?

517
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:00,240
Pretty much.

518
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:04,934
Businessmen, politicians.
Even the police are involved.

519
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:06,751
They're all in on it.

520
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:09,032
They're my boss' bosses.

521
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:12,116
It was my boss who
blocked you on Facebook

522
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:13,892
because you couldn't wait.

523
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,917
Because he wasn't replying to me.

524
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,740
But how did you end up
in this type of work?

525
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:24,251
You told me earlier you're
a permanent employee.

526
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:29,476
Permanent means we're
stuck doing this job.

527
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:32,334
We have protection from the higher-ups.

528
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:36,852
But we're not allowed to up and quit
because they're going to come after us.

529
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:43,337
The freelancers- like the girl
you're fantasizing about,

530
00:40:44,268 --> 00:40:48,172
most of them are students,
single mothers.

531
00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:52,193
Some are just curious
and doing it for fun.

532
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:59,418
They just have to make sure not to bury
themselves in debt with their agent

533
00:40:59,443 --> 00:41:01,850
or they'll find it hard to get away.

534
00:41:02,148 --> 00:41:03,399
Like you.

535
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,167
Pretty much.

536
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:13,266
Are you from a province?

537
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,082
Yes, in Nueva Ecija.

538
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:19,787
My mother wanted me to study here.

539
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:23,954
But I feel like we're just flushing
money down the toilet.

540
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:27,934
You're lucky if all you lose is money.

541
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:32,059
Sometimes it feels like
I'm losing myself, too.

542
00:41:32,084 --> 00:41:33,727
Pretty deep, huh?

543
00:41:34,094 --> 00:41:36,493
What about you,
where's your province?

544
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:38,518
I'm from Mindoro.

545
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:42,709
Somebody recruited me to be
a saleslady here in Manila.

546
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:47,934
When I got here, I'm suddenly
a prize for online ending.

547
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:51,142
At first, I did it because
I was scared.

548
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:53,992
They told me they'll kill my parents.

549
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:57,017
But even after my mom
had a heart attack,

550
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:59,892
I still couldn't bring myself
to leave the job.

551
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,141
Why?

552
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:06,184
It's no use. This is the only
thing I'm good at.

553
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:08,042
Besides, I'm used to it.

554
00:42:08,928 --> 00:42:10,303
The pay is good.

555
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:12,418
If nobody wins...

556
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,655
we get the money.

557
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:16,559
Sometimes, I miss life
in the province.

558
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:19,969
But I wouldn't know where to go.

559
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:24,657
To be honest, I'm anxious to
go back to the province.

560
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:29,767
But my mother insists
I take my chances here.

561
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,235
What choice do I have?

562
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:37,875
We'll get back home someday.

563
00:42:50,743 --> 00:42:51,910
Nice meeting you.

564
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:54,251
Nice meeting you, too.

565
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:55,543
Okay.

566
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:56,732
Be safe.

567
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:06,542
Hey!

568
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:09,879
Wait. I forgot to give
you something.

569
00:43:10,595 --> 00:43:11,219
What's that?

570
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,059
It's your winning ending card.

571
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:14,917
They say it's lucky.

572
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:16,042
- Keep it.
- Really?

573
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:18,660
I'll count on it.

574
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:21,476
Alright.

575
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:22,524
Okay.

576
00:44:12,781 --> 00:44:13,657
Nona!

577
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,748
- Nona!
- What?

578
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:26,790
- Nona who?
- Nanette?!

579
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:53,529
Why did you have to appear Nanette?

580
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:56,436
I want to think about Nona.

581
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:58,251
But you're the one who
keeps coming to my mind.

582
00:44:59,149 --> 00:45:03,704
No, it's only an illusion, Sixto.

583
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:06,360
Why can't you look me
in the eye, Sixto?

584
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:08,962
Don't you want to see me?

585
00:45:11,596 --> 00:45:13,847
Aren't you longing for this body?

586
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,001
If I bet on you, will I win?

587
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,756
Hey, Sixto!

588
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:31,059
Sixto. Your customer last
week finally paid up.

589
00:46:31,084 --> 00:46:32,657
Here's your pay.

590
00:46:33,649 --> 00:46:34,948
Thank you, uncle.

591
00:47:24,477 --> 00:47:26,272
Damn you!

592
00:48:10,937 --> 00:48:12,101
Hello?

593
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:16,433
Ah, hello? Do you still
remember me?

594
00:48:16,587 --> 00:48:17,462
Of course!

595
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:20,922
I can still smell the peanut
butter in my hair.

596
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:23,308
How are you?

597
00:48:24,016 --> 00:48:26,183
I'm fine. Same old.

598
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:34,557
I tried playing the other day but
I seem to be down on my luck.

599
00:48:35,766 --> 00:48:37,391
Better luck next time.

600
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:40,266
Can we meet?

601
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:45,641
Do you have money?
Where will you take me?

602
00:48:49,741 --> 00:48:51,699
What are you up to, Sixto?

603
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:54,475
You'll see. You'll like it.

604
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,475
Here we are.

605
00:48:57,308 --> 00:48:58,475
Are you ready?

606
00:48:58,641 --> 00:49:00,099
On the count of three.

607
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:03,641
One, two, three!

608
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:05,516
Surprise!

609
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:07,629
What's this?

610
00:49:08,308 --> 00:49:09,641
You even brought a bed!

611
00:49:09,933 --> 00:49:11,099
What's so funny?

612
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:12,682
You don't like it?

613
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:16,533
I was just surprised
but it's pretty neat.

614
00:49:18,516 --> 00:49:19,391
What's gotten into you?

615
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:22,058
Sorry, this is all I have
budget for right now.

616
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:28,308
Since last we saw each other,

617
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:30,557
I couldn't get you out of my head.

618
00:49:31,387 --> 00:49:32,429
Literally.

619
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:38,599
It's like everywhere I look,
you're right there.

620
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:41,933
I wanted to see you so badly.

621
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:45,933
I want to hold you.

622
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:47,724
Kiss you.

623
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:55,118
Whenever I try to think about
you while I do my business,

624
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,391
it's not the same.

625
00:49:57,463 --> 00:49:59,381
I can't even get it up.

626
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:04,974
That's why I went ahead
and called you.

627
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:08,849
My body's yearning for you.

628
00:50:10,058 --> 00:50:12,475
Does your heart yearn for me, too?

629
00:50:12,962 --> 00:50:14,891
No, I'm kidding. Corny.

630
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,346
I don't know.

631
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:21,266
Why do they always talk
about the heart?

632
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:24,433
When it's just one of many
parts of the body.

633
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,974
My lips want your lips,

634
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:30,754
My hands want to touch you,
even my thighs.

635
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:32,266
Isn't that romantic?

636
00:50:33,641 --> 00:50:35,074
Okay, fine.

637
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:38,933
I'm here now.
What do you want?

638
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:44,433
It's up to you.
Whatever you like.

639
00:50:47,058 --> 00:50:50,933
Didn't you feel anything
when we met?

640
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:55,712
If I did, so what?

641
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,532
This night will end the
same as other nights

642
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:01,058
and we'll go back to our own
thing come tomorrow.

643
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,832
I'll be back at my job,

644
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:06,516
and you'll be doing whatever it
is that's eating up your time.

645
00:51:07,724 --> 00:51:10,594
You're just horny, Sixto.
Don't take it too seriously.

646
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:14,891
What if I told you
I want to be with you?

647
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:19,433
What if I want to take you
away from your job?

648
00:51:19,766 --> 00:51:21,016
Have you gone crazy?

649
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:23,849
You can't even pay for a motel.

650
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,653
Well, where would you take me?

651
00:51:26,187 --> 00:51:27,728
Where would we go?

652
00:51:32,058 --> 00:51:33,641
To the province!

653
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,110
We can look for a new
province to call our own.

654
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,649
And if my boss tracks us down?

655
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,766
How would you defend me?

656
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:43,665
Huh?

657
00:51:45,183 --> 00:51:46,724
I'll find a way.

658
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:51,807
But will you come with me?

659
00:51:56,141 --> 00:51:58,540
Let's think about it when
we have more to go on.

660
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:09,128
Give this to me, please.

661
00:54:09,153 --> 00:54:12,727
Let me have this one.

662
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:20,477
Thank you, thank you!

663
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:22,557
Sixto!

664
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,116
Package for you.
What is it?

665
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:27,099
Why is it so heavy?

666
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,799
It's from my classmate.

667
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:30,758
What is it?

668
00:54:30,783 --> 00:54:33,257
I don't know.
He just sent it to me.

669
00:54:33,282 --> 00:54:36,173
Are you sure? You're not
dealing drugs, are you?

670
00:54:36,198 --> 00:54:38,281
I got it, uncle.
I'll be in my room.

671
00:55:28,468 --> 00:55:29,343
Bang!

672
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:55,274
Let's meet later,
I'm taking you away.

673
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,946
One, two, three, four.

674
00:56:15,974 --> 00:56:17,071
Twenty.

675
00:56:24,345 --> 00:56:26,516
- Hello, TL?
- What is it, Lepot?

676
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:29,325
Yes, I'm ready to pay.
I have the money.

677
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,616
I'm just 80 thousand short.

678
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:31,366
80 thousand!?

679
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:35,450
I know Boss Paps might get
angry but I thought maybe—

680
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,298
- What maybe?
- Huh?

681
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:40,200
Find a way to get all of it.

682
00:56:40,225 --> 00:56:42,313
Okay, okay, TL.
I'll work something out.

683
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:45,491
Damn you!

684
00:56:45,516 --> 00:56:47,116
Think!

685
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,931
Think! What haven't
you sold yet?

686
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,786
Dude, I need the camera.

687
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:57,469
I have an emergency.
Money issues.

688
00:56:57,494 --> 00:57:00,427
Where are you? Are you home?
I can drop by.

689
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:03,181
I'm on my way, love.

690
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:25,068
You picked the worst
time to do this, bro.

691
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:52,994
Bad timing, bro.

692
00:57:55,494 --> 00:57:58,828
San Jose, Last trip! Last trip at 9 P.M.!

693
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:07,983
Sixto!

694
00:58:08,824 --> 00:58:10,185
Sixto!

695
00:58:10,296 --> 00:58:11,563
Oh, shit.

696
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:12,983
Sixto!

697
00:58:13,817 --> 00:58:15,192
Hey, Sixto!

698
00:58:15,942 --> 00:58:16,833
Hey!

699
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:17,958
You asshole!

700
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,686
Stop playing games!

701
00:58:19,711 --> 00:58:21,124
Hey!

702
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:22,904
Stop playing!

703
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:28,042
You asshole!

704
00:58:29,056 --> 00:58:32,452
Hey! Asshole!
What the hell?

705
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,900
Damnit. Did he just
stand me up?

706
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:38,653
Screw you!

707
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,150
What's wrong with you!

708
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:41,275
Sixto!

709
00:58:41,442 --> 00:58:43,776
You little shit, you think
you're faster than my ride?

710
00:59:03,526 --> 00:59:05,983
Hey! Shithead, why were
you running from me?

711
00:59:08,484 --> 00:59:11,882
Hey. Why were you running
from me? You're nuts.

712
00:59:11,907 --> 00:59:13,025
Bro.

713
00:59:13,275 --> 00:59:14,921
Huh? Where's my camera?

714
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:17,609
Bro, I had to sell it, bro.

715
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:20,250
Screw you, bro.

716
00:59:20,275 --> 00:59:22,317
Why did you sell it?
For how much?

717
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:23,526
Fifty thousand.

718
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,833
What the fuck, I got
that for 120 thousand, bro.

719
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:29,083
Where's the money?
I need the money.

720
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,567
It's gone, bro. It's gone.

721
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:31,858
How is it gone?

722
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,751
Bro, can I just pay you back?

723
00:59:33,776 --> 00:59:35,484
I really need it right now.

724
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:37,442
Damn you. What do
you need it for?

725
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,234
I'm rescuing my girlfriend.

726
00:59:39,484 --> 00:59:41,942
Shit, the chick you
won as prize?

727
00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:45,275
Shit, since when did you become
the hero of whores, huh?

728
00:59:48,858 --> 00:59:51,194
- Bro! Sorry, bro!
- Screw you!

729
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:58,046
Screw you!

730
00:59:58,817 --> 00:59:59,567
Bro!

731
01:00:00,692 --> 01:00:01,942
I need the money.

732
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:04,632
Bro!

733
01:00:20,858 --> 01:00:21,900
Everything in there?

734
01:00:21,925 --> 01:00:22,983
It's all here.

735
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:24,632
Let's go.

736
01:00:24,923 --> 01:00:26,194
Leave him.

737
01:00:27,108 --> 01:00:27,858
Come on.

738
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,859
Sir, have you seen this girl?

739
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:56,635
No. Maybe she already left.

740
01:00:57,025 --> 01:00:58,817
Miss, have you seen this girl?

741
01:00:58,983 --> 01:01:00,108
No, I haven't.

742
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:03,895
Last call. The bus is leaving.

743
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:06,250
The bus is leaving.
We're leaving now.

744
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:14,150
Love, where are you?
I'm here. Please reply.

745
01:01:16,025 --> 01:01:17,567
What took you so long, huh?

746
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,025
What took you so long?

747
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:33,963
And why do you look like that?

748
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,374
Let's go.

749
01:02:22,918 --> 01:02:23,835
Hang on.

750
01:02:33,022 --> 01:02:37,776
It's a friend's old house. I got him to
rent it to me for 1,000 a month.

751
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:40,384
We have the whole place to ourselves.

752
01:06:55,674 --> 01:06:57,466
You must have an opening now, sir.

753
01:06:57,491 --> 01:06:59,671
I'm sorry, we don't
have a vacancy right now.

754
01:07:39,948 --> 01:07:43,327
Sixto! We're out of gas.

755
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:51,561
That's okay. Use this
one over here.

756
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:16,485
You're home.

757
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:19,322
Have you had dinner? Hm?

758
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:38,942
How are you?

759
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,167
How's the job-hunting going?

760
01:09:42,082 --> 01:09:42,998
Exhausting.

761
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:48,947
Thanks.

762
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:57,528
Next time, it will be a real ring.

763
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,764
And then...

764
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:03,877
take your pick which lot
to build our house on.

765
01:10:03,902 --> 01:10:04,986
I'll make it happen.

766
01:10:05,528 --> 01:10:07,194
Again with your fairy tales.

767
01:10:07,445 --> 01:10:08,777
Don't you trust me?

768
01:10:08,802 --> 01:10:11,969
I'd rather you actually did it,
not just talk about it.

769
01:10:56,736 --> 01:10:58,069
Not right now.

770
01:11:01,403 --> 01:11:02,403
Can you stop?

771
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:08,236
How did my wife's day go?

772
01:11:08,777 --> 01:11:10,153
Your wife?

773
01:11:11,986 --> 01:11:13,236
Why, you don't like it?

774
01:11:14,611 --> 01:11:18,528
Wives get wed and have children.

775
01:11:18,986 --> 01:11:20,528
You can't afford that.

776
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,655
Just be patient for a
little while longer, okay?

777
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,825
I'll get a job soon.

778
01:11:28,278 --> 01:11:29,319
How many kids would you like?

779
01:11:30,777 --> 01:11:31,986
Can you handle seven?

780
01:11:32,944 --> 01:11:34,319
You want us to try now?

781
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:35,370
Yeah right.

782
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:37,319
We don't even have gas.

783
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:39,194
Tomorrow, I'll get to it, fine.

784
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:41,663
That's what you said the other day.

785
01:11:43,653 --> 01:11:45,111
I said tomorrow.

786
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:47,153
You're such a buzzkill.

787
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:48,986
Whatever. Go to sleep, then.

788
01:11:50,361 --> 01:11:52,027
Tomorrow I'll buy
your stupid gas tank.

789
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:55,278
Go to sleep!

790
01:12:20,498 --> 01:12:21,498
Hello, love.

791
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:23,711
Did you see what I sent you?

792
01:12:23,736 --> 01:12:24,653
The panties?

793
01:12:25,194 --> 01:12:27,169
Looks more like you
bought it for yourself.

794
01:12:27,194 --> 01:12:28,486
I'm sure it'll look
good on you.

795
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:32,736
I'll buy it now. Then let's
see you try it on later.

796
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:34,514
Alright. Be safe.

797
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:38,796
- How much?
- One hundred.

798
01:12:39,528 --> 01:12:40,236
Love!

799
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:53,528
Love!

800
01:12:56,736 --> 01:12:58,528
Love, I bought you something.

801
01:13:01,902 --> 01:13:02,611
Love?

802
01:13:18,586 --> 01:13:19,294
Love?

803
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:50,819
Love!

804
01:13:59,278 --> 01:14:02,236
The number you dialed
cannot be reached.

805
01:14:02,261 --> 01:14:04,811
Please try again later.

806
01:14:06,951 --> 01:14:09,586
Love, where are you?

807
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,961
What happened?
Why did you leave?

808
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:14,944
Please text me back.

809
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:31,165
Shit!

810
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:44,403
You little shit.

811
01:14:45,069 --> 01:14:47,519
Why aren't you answering my calls?

812
01:14:47,544 --> 01:14:49,336
I'm on my way home, uncle.

813
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:51,794
The police came by.

814
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:55,403
Asking if you had something to do
with the murder of some guy.

815
01:14:56,096 --> 01:14:58,513
I forgot the name.

816
01:14:59,177 --> 01:15:00,511
You know anything about that?

817
01:15:00,536 --> 01:15:01,794
No, uncle.

818
01:15:01,819 --> 01:15:05,528
But if you're caught up in something,
you won't lie to me about it, right?

819
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:08,770
Don't show up in here for now.

820
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:11,044
Stay wherever you're hiding.

821
01:15:11,069 --> 01:15:12,561
I'm not involved, uncle.

822
01:15:12,819 --> 01:15:14,836
And I'm not a murderer.

823
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:16,461
Okay, fine, then.

824
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,469
Talk to the police when
you get here, yeah?

825
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:20,902
Okay, uncle.

826
01:15:24,618 --> 01:15:25,827
Who was that?

827
01:15:27,488 --> 01:15:29,529
My nephew.

828
01:15:30,979 --> 01:15:32,730
He's coming back.

829
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,321
Well, that's that.

830
01:15:38,263 --> 01:15:43,597
He might walk in any minute.
We'll have to do it in a hotel again.

831
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,116
When are you going to
let me stay with you?

832
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:50,608
Well, when are you going
to leave your husband?

833
01:15:54,486 --> 01:15:58,991
Hm. One more kiss!
You smell so good!

834
01:17:07,695 --> 01:17:11,569
Sixto! I'm leaving, okay?

835
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,836
Watch the place.

836
01:17:14,086 --> 01:17:15,086
Sure, uncle!

837
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,232
Call me if you need
anything, okay?

838
01:17:20,617 --> 01:17:21,764
Okay, uncle.

839
01:18:09,486 --> 01:18:10,794
Tell me your name?

840
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,788
- Stop it!
- Come on!

841
01:18:14,176 --> 01:18:15,859
What's your name?

842
01:18:16,288 --> 01:18:19,072
- Nanette!
- What's your real name?

843
01:18:19,097 --> 01:18:20,105
Nina!

844
01:18:20,632 --> 01:18:21,632
Damn you!

845
01:18:22,902 --> 01:18:24,116
Meanie.

846
01:18:25,052 --> 01:18:26,451
How old are you?

847
01:18:26,686 --> 01:18:27,850
Eighteen.

848
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,138
Where are you from?

849
01:18:31,163 --> 01:18:32,455
Take a guess.

850
01:18:32,827 --> 01:18:34,250
Secret!

851
01:18:34,457 --> 01:18:35,972
Nowhere in particular.

852
01:18:35,997 --> 01:18:39,205
What's your occupation?

853
01:18:40,326 --> 01:18:41,935
I do some acting.

854
01:18:42,497 --> 01:18:45,725
Model, vlogger.

855
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:48,072
I play some games, too. Gamer.

856
01:18:48,413 --> 01:18:49,789
You want me to play you?

857
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:53,522
Please don't.

858
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:56,138
Cut it out!

859
01:18:56,163 --> 01:18:58,116
What, it's a beautiful view.

860
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:40,288
Well, Mr. Corpuz.

861
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,163
What a surprise.

862
01:19:42,188 --> 01:19:44,499
You have some nerve to
show up in my class.

863
01:19:45,334 --> 01:19:46,960
Talk to me next semester.

864
01:20:02,315 --> 01:20:03,190
What's this?

865
01:20:03,371 --> 01:20:04,330
My thesis, sir.

866
01:20:04,806 --> 01:20:05,848
Thesis?

867
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:08,761
You didn't submit anything
for me to approve.

868
01:20:08,786 --> 01:20:10,577
Now you're giving me your thesis?

869
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:13,402
That's not how theses work, Sixto.

870
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:15,376
Take it.

871
01:20:17,023 --> 01:20:18,522
I will see you next semester.

872
01:20:19,803 --> 01:20:21,388
Hang on, sir.

873
01:20:21,607 --> 01:20:23,960
I really just want to finish my thesis.

874
01:20:25,558 --> 01:20:29,184
If you don't think it's worth it,
I'll quit for good.

875
01:20:32,205 --> 01:20:35,538
I've just been going through
so many things lately.

876
01:20:36,953 --> 01:20:39,661
I will owe you a great
debt of gratitude, sir.

877
01:20:40,254 --> 01:20:44,588
It's very personal to me, sir.

878
01:20:45,499 --> 01:20:47,041
So please, accept it.

879
01:20:48,822 --> 01:20:52,655
I will be deeply indebted to you.

880
01:21:07,473 --> 01:21:09,765
Expect my feedback next week.

881
01:21:11,055 --> 01:21:13,013
And be ready for revisions.

882
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:29,722
Sir.

883
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:32,817
Congratulations, Mr. Corpuz.

884
01:21:32,842 --> 01:21:35,051
I've watched your documentary.

885
01:21:35,654 --> 01:21:37,613
And I am impressed.

886
01:21:37,638 --> 01:21:39,780
Your approach is very now, huh.

887
01:21:39,805 --> 01:21:40,972
Thank you, sir.

888
01:21:40,997 --> 01:21:44,822
You know what, I don't know
where you got your information

889
01:21:44,847 --> 01:21:48,430
or who is your source of
data but I really like it.

890
01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:51,263
- And, Mr. Corpuz,
- Yes, sir.

891
01:21:51,288 --> 01:21:53,221
I hope you don't mind.

892
01:21:53,246 --> 01:21:59,053
I have a friend over at Night Watch
who is looking for material

893
01:21:59,078 --> 01:22:01,494
much like your documentary.

894
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:04,640
I gave them a copy of your work.

895
01:22:05,028 --> 01:22:05,903
Sir?

896
01:22:06,305 --> 01:22:09,972
Don't worry, you'll be
credited properly.

897
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:12,638
And of course, you'll be given
a small honorarium.

898
01:22:12,805 --> 01:22:13,513
But, sir-

899
01:22:13,538 --> 01:22:15,872
It's going to air tonight.
Watch out for it.

900
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:21,643
Sixto Corpuz?

901
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:25,553
Yes, sir.

902
01:22:32,249 --> 01:22:34,288
You're a tough one,
aren't you?

903
01:22:36,015 --> 01:22:37,806
- I'll take care of it.
- Okay, sir.

904
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:38,976
Sir.

905
01:22:40,358 --> 01:22:42,346
I really have nothing to do with it.

906
01:22:42,371 --> 01:22:45,221
I don't have anything to
do with Lepot's death.

907
01:22:45,246 --> 01:22:46,671
You may not be directly involved.

908
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:51,108
But you do know something.

909
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:55,124
I really don't, sir.
I don't know anything.

910
01:23:00,259 --> 01:23:02,425
Make our jobs easier.

911
01:23:02,702 --> 01:23:06,430
You either killed him
or you know something

912
01:23:06,455 --> 01:23:10,914
about the death of Tirso Paredes,

913
01:23:10,939 --> 01:23:14,803
more popularly known as "Lepot"?

914
01:23:16,497 --> 01:23:22,647
It was clear on the CCTV that
you were spotted together recently.

915
01:23:23,288 --> 01:23:25,835
Sir, we just went out to eat, sir.

916
01:23:26,538 --> 01:23:28,858
Bullshit! Did you eat
out each other's dicks?

917
01:23:32,163 --> 01:23:33,847
It was Boss Paps!

918
01:23:33,896 --> 01:23:35,819
It's Boss Paps you want!

919
01:23:45,482 --> 01:23:50,874
And who the hell
is this "Boss Paps"?

920
01:23:51,566 --> 01:23:55,346
Lepot was an agent of O.E.M.

921
01:23:55,581 --> 01:23:58,733
There's a team leader,

922
01:24:00,752 --> 01:24:02,624
and there's Boss Paps.

923
01:24:04,222 --> 01:24:06,889
You son of a bitch! You better
clear up your story!

924
01:24:06,914 --> 01:24:09,039
I don't understand
a word you're saying!

925
01:24:10,778 --> 01:24:13,178
Listen to me! Asshole!

926
01:24:15,031 --> 01:24:16,989
Lepot was involved
in something illegal.

927
01:24:17,014 --> 01:24:19,680
And he was killed by
someone higher than him!

928
01:24:19,705 --> 01:24:21,296
All because of money.

929
01:24:29,007 --> 01:24:31,280
Are you dealing drugs?

930
01:24:33,106 --> 01:24:34,148
It's gambling.

931
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:52,546
Good boy.

932
01:24:53,705 --> 01:24:54,496
Yeah!

933
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:08,053
Uncle!

934
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:11,155
Uncle!

935
01:25:24,784 --> 01:25:25,450
Sir.

936
01:25:25,475 --> 01:25:28,059
Mr. Corpuz.
Where are you?

937
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:30,789
Do you have your TV on?

938
01:25:30,845 --> 01:25:33,263
Check Channel 11.

939
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:35,597
Your thesis is playing on TV!

940
01:25:35,904 --> 01:25:40,362
As a media practitioner
and a part of the academe,

941
01:25:40,387 --> 01:25:44,430
I've been studying and keeping
track of illegal activities online.

942
01:25:44,455 --> 01:25:47,305
And when I found out
about this online ending,

943
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:53,388
I was disturbed that this
sort of thing is rampant.

944
01:25:53,413 --> 01:25:58,780
My god! You can win guns,
drugs, even women!

945
01:25:58,805 --> 01:26:02,305
I told myself that the public
must be informed of this.

946
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:07,430
And with the help of my student
to track this Facebook online group,

947
01:26:07,455 --> 01:26:10,577
we were able to create this documentary.

948
01:26:10,955 --> 01:26:14,039
So, did you watch it?

949
01:26:17,111 --> 01:26:19,486
I want to apologize, Corpuz.

950
01:26:19,873 --> 01:26:24,581
You see, they told me they needed
an expert on the subject matter.

951
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:30,388
So I told them that
I made the documentary.

952
01:26:30,748 --> 01:26:34,832
But, of course, you will
get all the credit.

953
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:37,553
- Okay? Don't worry about it.
- That's alright, sir.

954
01:26:39,248 --> 01:26:40,834
It's not a big deal to me.

955
01:26:42,085 --> 01:26:47,280
- Okay. But hold on.
- Don't hang up just yet.

956
01:26:47,305 --> 01:26:55,358
I'll make sure we'll win awards for this!
I'm sure of it! We will make waves!

957
01:26:58,960 --> 01:26:59,783
Sir?

958
01:27:00,834 --> 01:27:01,797
Sir?

959
01:27:03,076 --> 01:27:04,088
Sir!

960
01:28:01,147 --> 01:28:03,726
- Isn't that Sixto?
- Yes, he is.

961
01:28:03,751 --> 01:28:08,042
He's probably part of the reason
for Sir Agulto's death.

962
01:28:08,067 --> 01:28:09,513
Maybe he killed him.

963
01:28:09,538 --> 01:28:15,600
We can't say. He's the last person
Sir was with.

964
01:28:16,711 --> 01:28:18,168
Hey. What's your problem?

965
01:28:31,575 --> 01:28:33,116
Hey, hold on a sec.

966
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,517
What is it?

967
01:28:34,783 --> 01:28:35,783
What do you want?

968
01:28:36,283 --> 01:28:37,158
Call me Nieves.

969
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:44,742
You're the thesis guy, right?

970
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:49,174
Word's out that Sir
Agulto didn't really

971
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,796
make the documentary
about Online Ending.

972
01:28:53,949 --> 01:28:55,499
Yes, miss, that's me.

973
01:28:55,783 --> 01:28:56,783
Happy now?

974
01:28:57,517 --> 01:29:01,434
What do you want, an interview?
Write-up? Autograph?

975
01:29:02,074 --> 01:29:03,283
Okay...

976
01:29:03,491 --> 01:29:04,908
You don't have to be so mean!

977
01:29:05,233 --> 01:29:07,892
I just want to know you.
Be friends with you.

978
01:29:08,838 --> 01:29:11,686
Let me tell you this, miss.
I'm not trying to be rude.

979
01:29:11,897 --> 01:29:13,639
But man, your timing is perfect.

980
01:29:13,822 --> 01:29:17,030
Don't you see my thesis
adviser got killed.

981
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:19,199
But he stole your documentary!

982
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,877
Shouldn't you be happy?

983
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:22,908
Are you out of your mind?

984
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:25,461
Who's happy when someone dies?

985
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,541
Whatever you're playing at,

986
01:29:29,186 --> 01:29:30,311
I'm not interested.

987
01:29:30,814 --> 01:29:33,022
I got so many problems as it is,
I don't need you.

988
01:29:55,213 --> 01:29:57,296
Hello. Who's this?

989
01:29:57,321 --> 01:30:00,405
Why still such a meanie?

990
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:01,655
Who the hell is this?

991
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,675
You already forgot?

992
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,241
It's Nieves.

993
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:07,825
The one you were mean to at school.

994
01:30:07,991 --> 01:30:09,408
Where did you get my number?

995
01:30:09,433 --> 01:30:10,883
I have my ways.

996
01:30:10,908 --> 01:30:12,639
I asked around.

997
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:16,158
Hey, miss. I don't have time
to play your games.

998
01:30:16,183 --> 01:30:18,383
Look, I'm sorry.

999
01:30:18,408 --> 01:30:20,686
I just want to get to know you.

1000
01:30:20,908 --> 01:30:22,867
You look like a very nice person.

1001
01:30:22,892 --> 01:30:25,174
There are plenty of nice
people in the world.

1002
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:26,675
Go bother them instead.

1003
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:27,867
Okay, fine.

1004
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:29,408
I'm coming clean.

1005
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:34,717
I've always wanted to talk to you but
I didn't have the courage until now.

1006
01:30:34,742 --> 01:30:36,061
I like you.

1007
01:30:36,783 --> 01:30:41,924
This might be my only
chance so hear me out.

1008
01:30:41,949 --> 01:30:42,949
Please?

1009
01:30:43,158 --> 01:30:45,575
Can I ask you out on a date?

1010
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,433
Sixto?

1011
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:49,460
We'll have dinner, that's it.
Promise.

1012
01:30:49,767 --> 01:30:51,475
We won't do anything else.

1013
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:55,283
Unless you'd like to
do something.

1014
01:30:55,308 --> 01:30:56,091
Miss.

1015
01:30:56,116 --> 01:30:59,658
Look, I know you need
someone to talk to.

1016
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:02,033
Plus, I'm a good listener.

1017
01:31:02,058 --> 01:31:03,601
Alright, fine, fine.

1018
01:31:04,074 --> 01:31:05,575
Dinner, and that's it.

1019
01:31:05,944 --> 01:31:08,174
And I can only offer
you my friendship.

1020
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:10,658
Sure! See you tomorrow?

1021
01:31:10,683 --> 01:31:12,241
Yes, fine!

1022
01:31:16,825 --> 01:31:22,408
Wow, I watched your documentary
and you were brilliant.

1023
01:31:23,033 --> 01:31:24,867
It's so brave of you to expose them.

1024
01:31:25,366 --> 01:31:27,116
That wasn't my plan.

1025
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:30,258
I just wanted to submit my thesis.

1026
01:31:30,283 --> 01:31:31,742
And finish college.

1027
01:31:32,491 --> 01:31:34,835
That way my parents would
have something to be proud of.

1028
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:43,199
They think that once I finish college,
I'll be able to lift us out of poverty.

1029
01:31:44,366 --> 01:31:47,158
But I don't even know
what I want in life.

1030
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,174
You know what, same.

1031
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:55,949
At least all they expect
from you is to get a job.

1032
01:31:56,025 --> 01:31:59,709
They expect me to get a
husband and have children.

1033
01:31:59,797 --> 01:32:01,088
To have a family.

1034
01:32:01,389 --> 01:32:04,842
But if a woman tries to have sex

1035
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:09,008
to find out if she's sexually
compatible with a man she likes,

1036
01:32:09,033 --> 01:32:14,074
people will call her all sorts of names
like skank, whore, tramp.

1037
01:32:14,349 --> 01:32:19,084
People seem to expect women to just
be okay with sex for the sake of it,

1038
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:23,452
They never consider if we get
pleasure from it or not.

1039
01:32:24,575 --> 01:32:26,033
Screw that, right?

1040
01:32:31,116 --> 01:32:31,783
Right.

1041
01:33:17,575 --> 01:33:19,575
Anal, please.

1042
01:35:07,283 --> 01:35:09,049
Who is it? We're closed.

1043
01:35:09,074 --> 01:35:11,553
Don't go. Don't mind them.

1044
01:35:12,677 --> 01:35:14,686
Damn! What a prick!

1045
01:35:16,529 --> 01:35:17,694
Who is it?

1046
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:21,267
I'll just go check.

1047
01:35:23,116 --> 01:35:24,924
Son of a bitch, who are you?

1048
01:35:24,949 --> 01:35:27,158
The husband of the woman
you're tinkering with!

1049
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:31,783
Roman, don't do it!

1050
01:35:39,908 --> 01:35:41,133
So, how was it?

1051
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:44,533
It's okay. It's not as
good as I expected.

1052
01:35:45,674 --> 01:35:46,758
Really?

1053
01:35:47,017 --> 01:35:48,584
For me, it was fun.

1054
01:35:50,976 --> 01:35:52,342
Can you do another round?

1055
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:55,252
Wait. I have a present for you.

1056
01:35:57,075 --> 01:35:58,449
Better than anal.

1057
01:35:59,755 --> 01:36:00,838
Huh? What is it?

1058
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:07,718
What's that?
You're giving me drugs?

1059
01:36:07,743 --> 01:36:08,951
Say 'ahh'.

1060
01:36:09,842 --> 01:36:10,967
That's a drug, isn't it?

1061
01:36:11,134 --> 01:36:12,425
Just say 'ahh'.

1062
01:36:15,928 --> 01:36:17,053
Now swallow.

1063
01:36:17,078 --> 01:36:18,100
What is this?

1064
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:24,899
They say that if you take this,
you will see God.

1065
01:36:58,782 --> 01:37:01,531
Hello? Yes.

1066
01:37:01,997 --> 01:37:03,413
You can come up now.

1067
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:07,347
Such a shame.
You're cute,

1068
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:09,718
but you're a dumbass.

1069
01:40:12,461 --> 01:40:14,586
I dreamt about you again.

1070
01:40:22,926 --> 01:40:24,678
Damn this shit.
