00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,120
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,560
We can see us,

3
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,160
but humans...

4
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,440
cannot see us.

5
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,440
What do you think he'll die of? He looks so happy.

6
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,960
Why are you suddenly pitying humans?

7
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,440
You're cold-blooded and heartless.

8
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,680
Blood? Heart?

9
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not a human. I don't have those things.

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,240
This is not like you.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,720
Are you being sentimental because today is your last day?

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,440
I hope your next partner is someone better than me.

13
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm sorry, 444.

14
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,840
Are you hungry? What do you want to eat?

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,680
What about a burger?

16
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,960
- A burger? - Yes.

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,200
Gosh, there are so many people waiting.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,200
Wait in the car. I'll be right back with it.

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,000
- Be careful. - Okay.

20
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Just like how humans cannot see us standing right next to them,

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,560
they don't realize death is always there...

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,520
in their lives.

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,360
I'll get soda and...

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
Here's your shrimp burger couple set.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,520
Stay for three more minutes.

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
What?

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,120
What are you saying? Let go.

28
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,600
Then wait for just a minute.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,560
Stay here for one more minute.

30
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,960
Do you know why I dumped you?

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,200
It's because you bring misfortune.

32
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,160
Let go of me.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,040
Oh, my goodness!

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,080
- Oh, no! - What just happened?

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,440
Am I really dead?

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,280
You're looking at it.

37
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't believe this.

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,240
Let's go. We have a long way to go.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,560
Hey. What are you doing?

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
Remember death.

41
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,800
We're always by your side.

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,160
(Black)

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,960
Inside his body?

44
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,399
Inside of a human body?

45
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,240
Who is it? Who?

46
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,200
There. The one at the back.

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,560
- What? - Him.

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,640
Where?

49
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,440
There...

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,160
Gosh, he didn't have to push so hard. It hurt.

51
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,159
Where did he go anyway?

52
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,480
Joon.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,840
Detective Han.

54
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,440
Goodness! Oh, gosh.

55
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,040
Who's that?

56
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,240
Hello? We have an emergency.

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,200
Kim of S Middle School committed suicide...

58
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,000
by jumping off from the school rooftop today afternoon.

59
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,760
He miraculously survived his another identical suicide attempt recently,

60
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,360
and his death is bringing regrets to his beloved ones.

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,480
The police is still investigating the reason of his suicide.

62
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,360
However, his posts on the social media...

63
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,560
and the messages he exchanged with his friends showed...

64
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,880
that he was feeling pressure because of the college entrance exam.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,920
It seems the reason is his pessimism over his school records.

66
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,320
The police is trying to find out if there were any other reasons...

67
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,280
such as bullying or family trouble.

68
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,720
What brings you here so late...

69
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
after disappearing like that?

70
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
You said Joon was...

71
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,760
I mean Han Moo Gang was your first love.

72
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,840
- What? - Do you still like Joon,

73
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,680
Han Moo Gang... I mean, me?

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,640
You do, don't you?

75
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,240
Stay close to me then. Don't leave my side.

76
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,440
From now on,

77
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
I need you to be my eyes.

78
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,400
You treated me like a nuisance earlier today.

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,080
- Why are you doing this? - What?

80
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,760
Goodness! Oh, gosh.

81
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,600
You know the fact that I can see the shadow...

82
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,480
and that the person with the shadow always dies.

83
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,120
That woman can see us?

84
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,640
That means I can find my partner hidden inside a human with her eyes.

85
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm glad I kept her alive.

86
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
That's...

87
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
Well...

88
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,400
Why did you change your mind so suddenly?

89
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
You yelled at me to get lost.

90
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,040
It's because I want to help you.

91
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,640
- What? - You said the one with shadow dies.

92
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,120
If the shadow is inside someone, that person will die very quickly.

93
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,400
The student you saw who had the shadow inside his body.

94
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,760
He jumped off from the rooftop in an hour.

95
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,040
- I know. - Don't you think we should...

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
do something to prevent such misfortunes?

97
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,880
All right. Stay close to me from now on,

98
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,520
and if you see that shadow inside of someone again,

99
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,360
let me know that instant. Do you get it?

100
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,800
- Okay? - You jerk.

101
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,120
Are you kidding me?

102
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,360
- What? - You treated me like a stranger...

103
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,880
and told me to get lost. And now, what?

104
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
You want to save people's lives together with me?

105
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,200
Do you think I'm a pushover? Do you?

106
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,600
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

107
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,800
You knew I was the kid with sunglasses in Moojin, right?

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,760
You knew it all along, right? Why did you pretend not to?

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,920
Why did you pretend not to know?

110
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,680
I lost my memories. When I got shot in the head, I lost my memories.

111
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,920
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

112
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,520
Forget everything that has happened until now,

113
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,680
and just stay by my side. Okay?

114
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,280
You really can't remember?

115
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,240
Nothing. None at all.

116
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,200
I couldn't even remember my own name.

117
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
So please understand.

118
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,559
Just understand me, and stay close to me.

119
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,679
No. No!

120
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,200
What's the reason? Why?

121
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
It's all my fault.

122
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,560
- What is it now? - Because of me,

123
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
you almost died.

124
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,040
If I hadn't deluded myself that I can save people's lives,

125
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,720
you wouldn't have taken hostage instead of that man...

126
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
or nearly gotten killed.

127
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,760
How can I help you save people's lives again now?

128
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,920
No, I'm fine. I really am.

129
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,760
I will never try to save someone's life again.

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,880
Stop talking, and do as I say.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,840
I said no. I won't do it.

132
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,440
How dare a lowbrow human disobey me?

133
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,120
I desperately need your eyes right now,

134
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,520
so stop complaining, and find the shadow inside...

135
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,160
Are you deaf?

136
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,680
I said no!

137
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,120
Stop.

138
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,600
How dare you disobey me?

139
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,600
If you don't do as I say,

140
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,000
I will pull your eyes out right now.

141
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,840
What?

142
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,880
You don't think I can do it?

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,560
I can easily pull out a human's eyes!

144
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,880
What? Did you think that would frighten me?

145
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,840
If you want to keep your manhood, get lost. Do you hear me?

146
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,160
I can't believe he lost his memory.

147
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,800
It's all my fault.

148
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,960
Don't you die, Dad.

149
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,160
You have to live a long life for me.

150
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,600
Who told you guys to let that punk in here?

151
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,560
I allowed it.

152
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,480
Since regaining his consciousness,

153
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Mr. Chairman has been wanting to see his youngest son.

154
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,000
What are you guys waiting for? Drag him out!

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,560
Dad, Dad. Let go!

156
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,880
- Let go of me! - Hey!

157
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,080
- Let go of me right now! - What are you doing? Let him go!

158
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
You're just my dad's doctor. Know your place, please.

159
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,840
If you let that rat in here without my permission once again,

160
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,760
I will not let it slide.

161
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,720
Okay,

162
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,600
sir.

163
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,680
What?

164
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,320
Are you upset because I interfered when you were...

165
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,880
about to catch up with your youngest son whom you adore so much?

166
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,200
If he finds out what kind of person you really are,

167
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,080
will he be able to call you Dad...

168
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,240
like he does now?

169
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,840
Man Soo, that love child,

170
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,480
has his mother's dirty lowborn blood,

171
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,520
so he may be understanding about what you did.

172
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Remember this.

173
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,000
The person who's cleaning up the mess you created...

174
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,360
is not that punk. It's me,

175
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,440
Oh Man Ho.

176
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,000
Please let everything go and leave already...

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,200
for the sake of Royeol Group.

178
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,320
I'll make sure your funeral is a grand one.

179
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,840
Doctor.

180
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,240
I heard you work here.

181
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,880
Did you get hurt or something?

182
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,240
No, it's not that. Well...

183
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
About Detective Han...

184
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,960
He said he lost his memory due to the accident. Is it true?

185
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,480
Yes, it's true.

186
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,160
The bullet that day...

187
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,720
It's because of the gunshot injury, right?

188
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,560
Yes.

189
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
Does he...

190
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,120
Does he remember nothing?

191
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
That's right.

192
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,520
He's also showing strange behavior. It's probably caused by the shock.

193
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,840
I knew it.

194
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,640
By the way,

195
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,200
you said you got to know Moo Gang...

196
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,120
through helping him with his investigation of a case.

197
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
Pardon?

198
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,640
That's...

199
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,080
Well... I helped him track down a soldier who deserted the army...

200
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,120
because of his girlfriend who broke up with him.

201
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,040
You must be busy. I should get going now.

202
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,240
- Thank you. - No problem.

203
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,520
You just watch.

204
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,480
I'm going to save Royeol Insurance no matter what.

205
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,200
By the way, is that fortune-teller girl doing her job or what?

206
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
I haven't heard a word from her.

207
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,080
Ms. Fortune-teller?

208
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,600
What should we do?

209
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,440
The only thing that can help me find that loser...

210
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,400
is that girl's eyes.

211
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,960
Gosh, it doesn't look like it'll be easy.

212
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,680
Her first love almost died because of her,

213
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
and he even lost his memory.

214
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,320
She wouldn't want to follow you around and see the shadow again.

215
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Oh, dear.

216
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,240
Pass me the phone.

217
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,640
Okay, just a second.

218
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,600
This is...

219
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,160
Well, it's...

220
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,400
Be careful.

221
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,960
Hello?

222
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,160
You called me. Say what you need to say.

223
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,720
You know what?

224
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,800
My dad...

225
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,400
always said that I'm blessed by the skies.

226
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,160
That's why he named me Ha Ram.

227
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
I'm blessed?

228
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,440
Is that why...

229
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,320
I have no power or connections whatsoever?

230
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,320
I'm broke too.

231
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
I don't even have a boyfriend.

232
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
I don't have any friends either!

233
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,440
As if that's not bad enough, Joon also...

234
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,760
I think Joon also...

235
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,600
died because of me.

236
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,000
He has lost his memory too.

237
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Joon.

239
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm so sorry.

240
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,599
My dad...

241
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,160
My dad also...

242
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,280
died because of me.

243
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,680
Gosh, I can't believe it happened to you too.

244
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,680
Do you know what it feels like...

245
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,240
to be left all alone in this vast world?

246
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,120
Do you know what it's like?

247
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,920
I'm asking you if you know what it's like.

248
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,440
Go like this

249
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Kungtari shabara

250
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,640
Go like this

251
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,200
Gosh!

252
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,200
Lose some weight, will you?

253
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,640
You're so stocky and shapeless.

254
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,800
That's why you can't dance.

255
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,760
Lose some weight!

256
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,640
Gosh.

257
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,760
What on earth have you been eating?

258
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,040
You smell like garbage.

259
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Joon!

260
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,440
Joon!

261
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,040
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,440
I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.

263
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,320
I'm sorry...

264
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,120
- Go! Run! - Gosh, my legs. Okay, I heard you.

265
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,560
Run.

266
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,760
Giddy up. Go!

267
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,560
- For goodness' sake. - Come on. Run.

268
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,000
- Be gentle, will you? - Goodness.

269
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,640
Gosh, she drooled.

270
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,040
Do you even know how much this is?

271
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,040
Ms. Fortune-teller.

272
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,280
I guess you're as lonely as I am.

273
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,640
Joon.

274
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,920
Joon.

275
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,080
Han Moo Gang.

276
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,880
Han Moo Gang...

277
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,560
- What? - Han Moo Gang.

278
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,760
She has two guys?

279
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,320
- Han Moo Gang! - Gosh, she's really something.

280
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,800
My dad...

281
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,160
My dad also...

282
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,200
died because of me.

283
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,520
Gosh, why did she cry like that?

284
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,080
I feel bad now.

285
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,960
Should I just give this to her?

286
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,120
No, no.

287
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,120
I need to sort out my situation first.

288
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,800
By the way,

289
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,040
did this man...

290
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,680
really kill her dad?

291
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
We're okay.

292
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
There you are.

293
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,320
Come here!

294
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,400
You brats!

295
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,840
Come here!

296
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,120
Run!

297
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,760
You brats!

298
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,120
Stop!

299
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,920
What?

300
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,120
Was that a dream? The thing that humans see when they sleep?

301
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,240
They startled me.

302
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,480
I mean, isn't it strange?

303
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,400
You said she could even see a grim reaper inside of a human.

304
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,840
Then why can't she see you inside of Moo Gang's body?

305
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,680
- It's strange. - It's because she was wearing...

306
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,080
Hold on.

307
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
When I met her at the school that day,

308
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,160
she wasn't wearing sunglasses. But she didn't notice anything.

309
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,160
If she saw me inside of this man, she would've made a big fuss.

310
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,080
Why can't she see me when she saw that idiot inside the boy?

311
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,440
Could it be...

312
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,480
Could it be...

313
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
This suit.

314
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,720
What about it?

315
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,240
It's black.

316
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,720
The shadow she sees is black too.

317
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,080
She said she could see a black shadow inside of him.

318
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,800
She can't see me because I'm wearing a black suit.

319
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,520
Are you saying this black suit is...

320
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,080
just like her sunglasses?

321
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,840
It makes sense.

322
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,320
You're hiding black with another black.

323
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,760
It's black-and-black strategy.

324
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,800
She won't be able to see you if you always wear something black.

325
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,800
I almost made a big mistake.

326
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
This can take a while.

327
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,280
I should buy a few more black suits.

328
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,680
You look great in a black suit.

329
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,880
- I know, right? - Yes.

330
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,440
What was his name again? Bread?

331
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,600
- Joe Black. - Black.

332
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,800
Black.

333
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,520
Black.

334
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Black.

335
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,800
I like it.

336
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,760
In that case, I will call you...

337
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,640
Black from now on.

338
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,000
(Seoun Police Station)

339
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,080
Of course, sir.

340
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
What?

341
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,440
Who is he?

342
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,200
What is it?

343
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,640
You're not very polite, are you?

344
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,680
You should greet him. He's the commissioner general.

345
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,320
What are you doing? Why are you blowing air into my ear?

346
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,520
Are you a pervert?

347
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,720
Who is that jerk?

348
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,080
He recently injured his head. I'm so sorry.

349
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
- Train him better. - Yes, sir.

350
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,440
Most importantly, we have to stop losing young customers.

351
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,920
Young people don't think of death...

352
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,080
as something close to them.

353
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,320
To them, life insurance is...

354
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,200
something only old people need. We have to break that bias.

355
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,440
Speaking of which, for this year's Halloween,

356
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm thinking of throwing a party for our VVIPs in their 20s to 40s.

357
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,560
A very fancy and luxurious one.

358
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,320
It'll make them take pride as Royeol's client...

359
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,280
and recommend it to many of...

360
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,960
their families and friends.

361
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,560
All right. We'll have it at my villa in Yangpyeong.

362
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,600
Among our clients in their 20s to 40s,

363
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,680
let's select VVIPs, invite them, and promote the party.

364
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,840
That's all. Get back to work.

365
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,520
My dear Sip Gyeon. That was boring, right?

366
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
Excuse me, sir.

367
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,280
- What is it? - Well...

368
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,440
We cleaned out Ms. Han Jin Sook's locker, the employee who died,

369
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,000
and we found her notebook.

370
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Should we throw it away or give it to her family or the police?

371
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,040
Give it to me.

372
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,120
The commissioner general was there, and what? A pervert?

373
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,600
Do you want to get fired?

374
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,800
No.

375
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,400
You're being rude again.

376
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
You'd better talk to me politely now!

377
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,280
- I'm your superior! - Hello?

378
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,240
I'll be right there. Okay.

379
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,960
You punk.

380
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,960
I should teach you a lesson today. How dare you?

381
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,560
Here.

382
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,520
Oh, yes.

383
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,960
You asked me to call you if we find anything...

384
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,800
- about Ms. Han Jin Sook. - Yes.

385
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,600
- Thank you for your cooperation. - Sure.

386
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,400
I looked through it, and it only had notes about her work.

387
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,560
I see.

388
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,840
One million dollars?

389
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,600
- Thank you. I should get going. - Okay.

390
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,200
- May I? - Sure. Should I pack some?

391
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,800
No, thank you.

392
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,200
- Take care. - You too.

393
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,000
Goodness, let's see. How much is this?

394
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,440
1, 10, 100...

395
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,320
My wife overused my credit card again.

396
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,360
She spent more than my salaries again.

397
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,120
What's this now? Let's see.

398
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,960
What? 120 dollars?

399
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,720
When did I drive too fast?

400
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,280
(A traffic violation)

401
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,040
"October 14", "Gangjeong Intersection"?

402
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,000
"140km per hour"?

403
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,920
What is this?

404
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
(Obligator: Han Moo Gang)

405
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,520
Gosh, it scared me for a second.

406
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,080
I almost wet my pants a bit because I thought it was for me.

407
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,160
You were insane even before the injury.

408
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,840
140km per hour?

409
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,600
Gosh, you punk.

410
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,120
Are you a racer? Take a look.

411
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,960
Hold on.

412
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,160
October 14.

413
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,920
"Gangjeong Intersection"?

414
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,080
That's the day he got shot at the shopping mall.

415
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,840
What?

416
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
That's right. "4:20pm".

417
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,640
Around that time...

418
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,240
- Please let me go. - I can't do that.

419
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,720
- I'll pick her up for you then. - What?

420
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,960
Where in Nine PM is it?

421
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,320
- Detective! - Yes.

422
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,560
Gangjeong Intersection and the mall are in the opposite direction.

423
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,200
Why did he go there when he headed out for the mall...

424
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,680
and overspeed?

425
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,520
Excuse me.

426
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,840
How can I help you?

427
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,680
We're from Yeongjae Police Station.

428
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,600
Is Detective Han Moo Gang here?

429
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Did you find out anything?

430
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
- Who are they? - From Yeongjae Police Station.

431
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,760
They just look like a couple of idiots.

432
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,720
Why? Do they need backup force for a case again?

433
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
I don't think it's about that.

434
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,720
Why is Moo Gang in there?

435
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,440
I don't know what kind of trouble he is this time.

436
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
- You really don't know him? - No.

437
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,040
Please understand. He recently had...

438
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,960
a severe head injury.

439
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,840
Who is this man?

440
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,480
He's a commando who accidentally...

441
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,720
shot Detective Han when he was taken hostage.

442
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,320
He lit a briquette in his car and attempted suicide last night.

443
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
He's unconscious right now.

444
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Oh, dear. Why did he do that?

445
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,280
We'll find out details as we investigate,

446
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,360
but his case was referred to the disciplinary committee,

447
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,160
and they imposed severe disciplinary action. It really stressed him out.

448
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,960
Besides, his sick wife passed away recently.

449
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,480
We're assuming these are the reason for his extreme action.

450
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,240
Anyhow, we should continue our investigation.

451
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,120
My gosh, he still shouldn't have done that.

452
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
But why do you need to talk to Detective Han?

453
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
The last person he called...

454
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,080
was Detective Han.

455
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,400
The phone call only lasted around 10 seconds.

456
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,640
So I don't think it was enough time for them to have had a conversation.

457
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,640
But I just wanted to ask if you had ever called him...

458
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,280
or met him separately before the incident.

459
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,960
No. I've never seen him in my life.

460
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,960
Oh, I get it now. I guess he must've called...

461
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,440
to tell him that he's sorry.

462
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,360
That must be why he called him.

463
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,600
But then again, he did make him into a fool.

464
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,560
He used to be a smart guy.

465
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,600
Okay, that's enough for now.

466
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Please call us if you ever get reminded of anything.

467
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Okay. See you. Bye.

468
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Hey. What? Really?

469
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,800
(Freezer Murder Incident)

470
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,160
("The Freezer Murder Case Has Still Not Been Solved")

471
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,480
Jin Sook, have you gone mad?

472
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,440
You threaten him by saying that you have the tape?

473
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,040
I got a loan without my husband knowing.

474
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,440
But my debt slowly started to increase so much.

475
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,920
Sun Young. You have that tape, right?

476
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,800
Let's give him that tape, and ask him for some money.

477
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,600
I don't have it.

478
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
He took it with him that day.

479
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,080
What are you talking about?

480
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,840
He totally bought it when I told him that I have it.

481
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,280
What? Really?

482
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,880
Yes. If he actually had it,

483
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,320
he wouldn't have asked me to meet.

484
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,480
He asked you to meet?

485
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,960
Hey.

486
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,640
Are you crazy?

487
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,760
Are you trying to get yourself in trouble?

488
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,760
If you don't want to die,

489
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,760
you better not meet him. Just hide, and live a quiet life.

490
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,440
And don't ever call me again.

491
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,240
What?

492
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,960
That means he didn't take that tape with him that day.

493
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,680
Then where in the world is it?

494
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,680
Tell me!

495
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,280
What happened 20 years ago?

496
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,000
That tape that she was looking for...

497
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,080
It's all because of that tape.

498
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,560
Where is that tape?

00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,480
Where is it?

00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,080
I wonder if Moo Gang found it.

501
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,160
If he did, I'm sure he must've hid it in that basement.

502
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,720
Yes.

503
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,160
As long as that's gone, they won't be able to do anything to me.

504
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,960
That will make Moo Gang safe as well.

505
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,760
Hey. Hey.

506
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,480
Detective Han is here.

507
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,680
I'll be outside. You guys can talk.

508
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,240
What is it that you want to say?

509
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,520
Nurse! Nurse!

510
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,720
Nurse! Hurry up! Come on!

511
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Hey! What happened?

512
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,440
- Hurry! - Please move.

513
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,200
Hey, excuse me.

514
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,480
What did he say to you?

515
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,040
He said he's sorry.

516
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,160
I went to see 10 people today.

517
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,480
But I couldn't find any shadows.

518
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,560
Joon.

519
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,040
I thought you wouldn't be able to finish it, but you did.

520
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,720
- What? - Never mind.

521
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,440
Here's the list of our VVIP members that you need to check out tomorrow.

522
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,520
What? "Mujin"?

523
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
I thought I'd only be responsible for the ones in Seoul.

524
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,040
You'll have to go all over the country.

525
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,120
My gosh, there isn't even a flight to Mujin.

526
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,040
How many hours will it take me by car?

527
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,199
He's a good friend of my dad's.

528
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,639
So take a close look at him, okay?

529
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,239
My goodness, Sip Gyeon. Let's eat.

530
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Here you go.

531
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,080
That dog's life is better than mine.

532
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,199
Sip Gyeon. Do you know what the meanest thing in the world is?

533
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,000
It's to cheat on someone.

534
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,600
My gosh, look at you enjoying your meal.

535
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,440
The meanest thing in the world...

536
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,760
is to give that salmon to a dog instead of a human.

537
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,600
What a petty CEO.

538
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,600
I'm hungry.

539
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,840
Why won't it open?

540
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,760
What is it that you want to say?

541
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,160
I'm sorry.

542
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,480
I tried to commit suicide...

543
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,000
because I was...

544
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
embarrassed of what I did.

545
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,440
But...

546
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,760
I didn't have...

547
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,640
a choice.

548
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,760
What do you mean?

549
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,480
I had to do it.

550
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,880
No.

551
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,800
I just did it anyway.

552
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,440
What are you talking about?

553
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,080
Your injury...

554
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,440
wasn't caused accidentally.

555
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,880
He's going to...

556
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,720
try to kill you again.

557
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,840
So before he does,

558
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,440
hurry up...

559
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,440
That means Moo Gang wasn't killed accidentally,

560
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,640
which means he was purposely murdered.

561
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,760
Then that means he wasn't sacrificed for anyone else's life.

562
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,920
He was supposed to die that day anyway.

563
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Yes.

564
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,440
That means he didn't die because of that woman.

565
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,000
That's great.

566
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,960
But how am I supposed to explain this to her?

567
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,840
If I take her to the sniper,

568
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,640
she'll probably waste time by saying that...

569
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,160
she'll go after the guy who gave orders to kill Moo Gang.

570
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,400
How should I tell her this?

571
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,320
"Gangjung Intersection"?

572
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,120
That's the opposite way from the shopping center.

573
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,840
Why did he go there,

574
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,200
and violate the speed limit?

575
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,400
What are you doing? When did you get here?

576
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,480
Yes.

577
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,440
What time did you say I left that day?

578
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,680
It was around 4pm.

579
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,400
4pm...

580
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,400
Moo Gang left the police station that day at 4pm.

581
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,000
Then 20 minutes later,

582
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,480
he got a speeding ticket at Gangjung Intersection.

583
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,840
And that's on the southern side of Seoun.

584
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,400
That's on the complete opposite side of the shopping mall...

585
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,000
that's located at the northern side of Seoun.

586
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,560
What are you doing?

587
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Yes.

588
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,080
Moo Gang didn't head to the shopping mall that day.

589
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,880
But he got shot in the head and died at 7pm.

590
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,640
Why does he talk as if it's someone else's story?

591
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,600
Did you say from 5pm to 7pm?

592
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,680
Yes.

593
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,160
How many times do I need to tell you?

594
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,560
You said it's 66M6900.

595
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,560
66M6900.

596
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,720
Here it is.

597
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,240
So he really did arrive six hours later after having gone somewhere.

598
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,080
Isn't that you?

599
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,040
Wait.

600
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Does that mean the shopping mall is on this side?

601
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,480
No, the shopping mall is on the other side.

602
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,160
That side leads to the hotel.

603
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,360
- "The hotel"? - Yes.

604
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,040
Moo Gang was on his way to a hotel?

605
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,440
Yes, that's where Ji Dong disappeared.

606
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,520
I remember seeing Moo Gang at the hotel corridor that day.

607
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,840
So he was at the hotel instead of being at the shopping mall?

608
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,720
Why?

609
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,560
Rewind it.

610
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,480
Fast forward it.

611
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,960
Keep going. Continue. Stop.

612
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,640
Where is this guy?

613
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,240
I need to help Joon regain his memory no matter what.

614
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,920
Oh, right. We took this photo at Mujin.

615
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,800
I wonder...

616
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,560
if he'll remember anything if I show him this photo.

617
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,320
I should show this to him when I meet him.

618
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,840
Detective Han.

619
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,360
You have something to say to me?

620
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,880
Tell this woman what you told me.

621
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,280
Okay.

622
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,360
On the day he was captured as hostage,

623
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,200
this detective over here gave me some money...

624
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,600
and asked me to escort an old lady with Alzheimer's...

625
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,960
to the Homicide Team at Seoun Police Station...

626
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,280
because of an urgent appointment he had at the hotel.

627
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,160
Then he hurriedly ran towards the hotel.

628
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,840
That's why I took her to where I was told to.

629
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,240
What?

630
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,880
He definitely said he was...

631
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,120
on his way to bring his mother.

632
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,920
Who do you think he was supposed to meet at the hotel?

633
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,480
I don't know.

634
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,520
I can't remember.

635
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,080
So are you saying...

636
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,280
you asked the parking guy to take your mother to the police station,

637
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,360
and on your way out from the hotel,

638
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,440
you got captured by that soldier accidentally?

639
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,240
That's right. Even if you hadn't saved that guy's life that day,

640
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,480
Moo Gang would've been at the crime site anyway and died.

641
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,360
No.

642
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,600
I almost died.

643
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,880
That just reminded me of something.

644
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,480
When I saw that guy's shadow,

645
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,400
I heard more than one gun shot.

646
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,960
Yes.

647
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,720
I heard two gun shots.

648
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,840
I think I heard them almost simultaneously.

649
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,360
I just remembered.

650
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,880
I also saw blood...

651
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,160
flowing from behind me.

652
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,040
That means...

653
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,680
Moo Gang was right behind me.

654
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,560
Like you said,

655
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,360
if I got shot because I offered to bring his mom to the police station,

656
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,440
that parking guy should've been the one to get shot, not me.

657
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,840
Don't you agree?

658
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,560
But like you can see, that parking guy's completely fine.

659
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,080
I didn't even know that.

660
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,040
I thought...

661
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,880
you got hurt because of me.

662
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,080
I need to take you somewhere.

663
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,360
If you hadn't agreed to save lives, that man over there...

664
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,280
would be lying in his grave right now.

665
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,480
That's not it.

666
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,320
Do you think that woman with Alzheimer's would still be alive?

667
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,840
You saved both of their lives.

668
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,840
You did something great.

669
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,800
Ha Ram.

670
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,120
Look straight into my eyes.

671
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,560
No one died that day.

672
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,720
I'm also standing right in front of you.

673
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,960
Do you remember...

674
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,280
that male student who had a shadow inside his body?

675
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,000
If you hadn't ignored him like you did, that boy...

676
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,960
would probably be spending time with his family right now.

677
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,720
So from now on,

678
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,080
just stay next to me,

679
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,040
and tell me whenever you see...

680
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,200
another person with a shadow inside of their body.

681
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,040
You can't let yourself make the same mistake again.

682
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,120
Right?

683
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,520
It's time for food.

684
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,840
Your palate changed a lot.

685
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,360
You used to hate intestine soup.

686
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,040
I'm glad that...

687
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,280
I wasn't the reason why you almost got killed.

688
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,400
It was so tormenting until now.

689
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,160
But I can finally be at ease.

690
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,920
Okay.

691
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,880
Hearing you say that makes me feel happy.

692
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,720
You're going to stay by my side from now on,

693
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,080
and tell me whenever you see anything black, right?

694
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,960
I'll think about it.

695
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,400
What? Why?

696
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,120
Moo Gang didn't almost die because of you. No.

697
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,080
I didn't almost die because of you.

698
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,160
I explained it to you already. What would you need to think about?

699
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,960
It's not that simple. I also have a job to fulfill.

700
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,600
What? I'm late.

701
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,640
My gosh, I barely have enough time to go to Mujin and come back.

702
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,360
Please excuse me.

703
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,480
Wait.

704
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,520
Where are you going? We're not done talking.

705
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,560
Oh, right.

706
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,160
My dad took this photo when we went to the stream to fish.

707
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,160
I thought maybe this could help you regain your memory.

708
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,040
Look at it carefully, okay?

709
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,240
I'll call you.

710
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,520
Hey, wait.

711
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
Why is the office so empty?

712
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,360
It's way past lunchtime already.

713
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,720
Gwang Gyun just called to tell me that he's on his way to Mujin...

714
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,720
to do an investigation on Han Jin Sook's murder.

715
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,120
And Detective Park is at the hospital...

716
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,560
to treat his hand tremor.

717
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,880
These jerks. Where's Moo Gang?

718
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,960
Don't you know that you need to be back here by 1pm?

719
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,920
These punks seem to think there are no rules around here.

720
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,440
Why isn't she picking up?

721
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,240
I tried so hard to convince her. It's about time she understood.

722
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,600
What? Can he not see me?

723
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,840
He's pretending as if he can't hear me.

724
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,440
Oh, right. This guy has a bullet in his head. I should hold my anger in.

725
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,480
I'll just hold it in. My gosh.

726
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,320
Let's be peaceful.

727
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,280
Let's put up with it since I'm normal.

728
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,480
Hey, Gwang Gyun.

729
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,560
Did you look into what I asked you to last time?

730
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,640
Yes, I tracked Han Jin Sook's bank account.

731
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,160
But nothing's been transferred to her account.

732
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,320
Really?

733
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,600
- Okay. - Okay.

734
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,760
(Welcome to Mujin.)

735
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
I'm pretty sure this place is it.

736
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,560
Who did she meet here?

737
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,880
Sir.

738
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,320
How long has it been?

739
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,720
I got appointed to a police station in Seoul after Soo Hyuk died.

740
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,120
So it's been around 20 years.

741
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,280
- "20 years"? - Yes.

742
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,880
Has it really been that much?

743
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,000
I wouldn't have recognized you if I met you on the street.

744
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,240
You've changed so much.

745
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,760
You used to be so naive and...

746
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,480
My gosh, that's what life does to you.

747
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,880
By the way, congratulations on getting promoted.

748
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,960
It's nothing.

749
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,320
But then again, I am the youngest one to be in this position.

750
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,960
By the way, what brings you here?

751
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,480
I came here to check a CCTV footage.

752
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,800
I was told to wait for around 20 minutes.

753
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,800
I just came to see you while I was here.

754
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,920
I see. What CCTV footage?

755
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,120
It's to investigate about the recent freezer murder incident.

756
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,440
We joke around saying that it's a cold case.

757
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,960
I came here because I saw an address from Mujin in the victim's notebook.

758
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,960
And I saw a CCTV camera at the scene.

759
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,640
I just want to see if anything got caught on the camera.

760
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,360
- Is that right? - Yes.

761
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,720
Oh, excuse me for a second.

762
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,920
Hello?

763
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,840
It's been restored?

764
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,320
- They restored it? - Yes.

765
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,040
Okay, thank you. I'll come down shortly.

766
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,000
Hey, just check it here.

767
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,280
Tell them to email it to me.

768
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,840
- Can I do that? Hello? - Yes.

769
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Please send it to Mr. Commissioner General via email.

770
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,240
You know his email address, right? Yes.

771
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,360
Okay, thank you.

772
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,320
- It sounds like you got an email. - Yes.

773
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,360
All right. Shall we have a look?

774
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,760
- I got the email. - Let me have a look.

775
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,480
- Okay. - I need to watch it.

776
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,560
Let's see. This is...

777
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,320
I'll copy the file onto my flash drive.

778
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,360
Sure.

779
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,360
(Han Jin Sook, Royeol Insurance)

780
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,840
Is the victim's name Han Jin Sook?

781
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,400
Sorry? Oh, yes.

782
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,280
Gosh, the resolution is so low.

783
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,560
Really? Let me see.

784
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,240
Jae Geun, this is useless as it is now.

785
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,720
I should check it again in Seoul.

786
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,640
Jae Geun, call me if you're ever in Seoul.

787
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,640
Let's grab a drink together. I know many good places.

788
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,240
Yes, of course.

789
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,640
- I'll get going. - All right. Get back safely.

790
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,280
- I will. - Bye.

791
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,440
- Hello. - Hello.

792
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,200
Do you know if Mr. Commissioner General has left for the day?

793
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,200
He's still here.

794
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,040
- I see. Thank you. - No problem.

795
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,880
What are you doing here, kids?

796
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,920
Do you guys want to see a puppy at my place?

797
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,440
(Loser)

798
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,360
You'll follow me around and tell me...

799
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,880
if you ever spot a human with the shadow inside the body, right?

800
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,200
- Excuse me. - Yes.

801
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,280
Around what time will Mr. Commissioner General be leaving?

802
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,160
He just left.

803
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,440
- Pardon me? - He just left.

804
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,040
Is that his car? Gosh.

805
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,000
No, no. Stop! Wait!

806
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,160
She's not picking up? How dare she not pick up?

807
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,160
Who does this human think she is?

808
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,120
I even confirmed that Han Moo Gang didn't die...

809
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,120
because of her and that he got murdered. What's her problem?

810
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,120
Han Moo Gang was murdered?

811
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,640
When the hostage situation was going on,

812
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,480
the killer killed him on purpose but staged it as an accident.

813
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,480
What the... So who killed him?

814
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,520
How would I know? I'm not even interested.

815
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,440
Gosh, that means we have a big problem.

816
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,440
- What do you mean? - The killer might try...

817
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,280
to kill Han Moo Gang again, thinking that he didn't die.

818
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,560
If that happens, you'll no longer be able to use that body.

819
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,720
A body that has died twice can't be used, you know.

820
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,000
You're right.

821
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,280
Yes.

822
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,640
Then where will you find another body of a detective?

823
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,800
Let's say you got lucky and found one by chance.

824
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,560
How will you manage to persuade that girl again in that body?

825
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,680
She's not even helping her first love.

826
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,480
If you ask her for a favor as a complete stranger,

827
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,600
she'll obviously say no.

828
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,640
This body is a lot more valuable than I thought it was.

829
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,840
Yes, absolutely. You should be thankful.

830
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,680
Treasure that body and use it well, okay?

831
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,240
Gosh, that's amazing.

832
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,240
That means Han Moo Gang is helping you big time, 444.

833
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,480
Hang on.

834
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,840
You happened to go into the body of that girl's first love.

835
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,480
What if all of it was his will?

836
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,520
What...

837
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,440
Is it you?

838
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,840
Let me live.

839
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,680
What did you say?

840
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,480
What did you say to Han Moo Gang?

841
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,760
I just...

842
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,200
apologized to him...

843
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,680
and told him how sorry I am.

844
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,040
I won't tell him.

845
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,640
Don't kill me, please.

846
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,800
He's going to try...

847
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,560
to kill you again.

848
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,720
So before he does, hurry up...

849
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,400
You should...

850
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,560
Hang on.

851
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,000
Who's the scumbag that keeps on trying to kill Han Moo Gang?

852
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,040
I cannot die again!

853
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,200
Gosh, that fool.

854
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,240
Are you okay?

855
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,440
Han Moo Gang. What on earth...

856
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,720
were you up to before you died?

857
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,360
Sir, please do not lose that car over there.

858
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,640
Yes, that car. Please keep following it.

859
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,720
My gosh! What?

860
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,480
Hey, kid. Are you all right?

861
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,680
Kid, are you okay? Wait.

862
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,680
Hey, kid!

863
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,880
Yes, Mr. Oh. I just checked.

864
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,280
He has no shadow with him.

865
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,320
Yes, I'm going to head back to Seoul right away.

866
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,680
Okay, bye.

867
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,520
Hey.

868
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,920
What are you doing here?

869
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,720
I'm not a bad person.

870
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,280
Where's your mom?

871
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,040
Mom? My mom?

872
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,960
My gosh, what are you doing here?

873
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,360
Doesn't he live in this neighborhood?

874
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,120
I've never seen him before.

875
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,400
Hey, where do you live?

876
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,120
You can't find your place?

877
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,240
Eun Hye, Eun Hye.

878
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,200
Eun Hye? Is that where you live?

879
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,920
Eun Hye Town House?

880
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,160
Don't cry.

881
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,520
Stop crying, okay?

882
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Don't cry. Try to remember where your place is.

883
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,080
Is it good?

884
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,560
Where did you leave your sock?

885
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,000
There we go.

886
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,680
Oh, is that right? Okay.

887
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,760
His dad is Officer Kim at Seochon Substation.

888
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,720
He's been running around trying to find his son.

889
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,080
- Oh, Officer Kim is that nice guy. - Yes.

890
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,880
Yes, that boy is Officer Kim's son.

891
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,840
Please wait just a little longer. His parents will be here shortly.

892
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,080
Sure, no problem.

893
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,920
Washroom.

894
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,560
What? Do you want to go to the washroom?

895
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,200
Excuse me, where's the washroom here?

896
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,800
- It's over there. - I see. Thank you.

897
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,120
Let's go. I'll take you there.

898
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,960
Gosh. Hey, hey!

899
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,560
Hey, you're...

900
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,800
Hey, why did you...

901
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,120
- Gosh, Geon Young! - Geon Young!

902
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,600
There you are, Officer Kim.

903
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,280
You must've been very worried. You look so pale.

904
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,440
Geon Young.

905
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,560
What's the matter?

906
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,720
That young lady found Geon Young and brought him here.

907
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,680
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

908
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,040
Have you been starving your son?

909
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,960
- Pardon? - Pardon?

910
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,720
He was eating a chocolate bar at a store barefoot.

911
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,600
Geon Young.

912
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,000
He has sugar sensitivity,

913
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,240
so we don't give him things like chocolate.

914
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,360
But he's still young,

915
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,360
so he leaves the house like this when he craves sweets. I'm sorry.

916
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,560
How can you let him wander around like that?

917
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,280
We're really sorry.

918
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,480
It's all my fault.

919
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,280
Goodness. He leaves the house the second you take your eyes off him.

920
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,320
He always wanders around barefoot.

921
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,880
Everyone in this area knows him.

922
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,720
I have huge respect for them for raising him. If I were his dad...

923
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,840
Officer Kim, you should take him home and give him dinner.

924
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,960
Thank you.

925
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,440
- We're really sorry again. - Oh, boy.

926
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,040
- Thank you. - Thank you.

927
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,200
- I'll call you. Speak to you soon. - Thank you. Take care.

928
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,800
(Social Security Card, Kim Cheol Soo)

929
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,560
Bye.

930
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,880
Excuse me.

931
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,840
Yes.

932
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,360
You dropped this.

933
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,720
- Thank you. - This too.

934
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,080
Please don't let him wander around. Make sure he stays home.

935
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,200
What do you mean?

936
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,240
Anyway, don't let him go outside.

937
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,160
Please make sure he doesn't leave the house.

938
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,800
- Okay. Thank you. - Okay, we will.

939
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,400
Thank you.

940
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,200
Take care.

941
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,960
I don't care. I've done my best.

942
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,640
I won't worry about him.

943
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,640
Ms. Han Jin Sook used to live here, right?

944
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,080
Yes.

945
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,480
What now?

946
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,040
Do you cops still have things that you want to ask me?

947
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,640
Just catch the killer, will you?

948
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,800
By any chance,

949
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,600
do you have any old photos of Ms. Han?

950
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,000
Photos?

951
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,800
Just a moment, please.

952
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,280
Where did I put the album?

953
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,240
Are you awake now?

954
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,800
Did you have a fight with someone?

955
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,360
I wonder who did that to you, Mr. Invincible.

956
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,760
By the way,

957
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,720
can you please turn on the TV before you leave?

958
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,520
We can't turn it on ourselves, you know. It's so inconvenient.

959
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,280
All right, come on. Please turn it on.

960
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,280
The drama will be on soon.

961
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,520
I can't let you have your way today.

962
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,600
"Show Me the Money" will start soon.

963
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,920
You brat.

964
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,200
There's a thing called hierarchy. Do you really want me to get into it?

965
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,360
You probably think that Crown Prince Sado died locked up in a rice chest.

966
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,920
That's not true at all.

967
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,920
I was right beside him when he died.

968
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,200
Be quiet!

969
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,560
What on earth was this guy up to before he died?

970
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,880
I must gather more intel on Han Moo Gang.

971
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,160
That's right.

972
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,920
I bet there's something there.

973
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,480
Yes, I should go there.

974
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,560
Where are you going?

975
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,480
What are you doing?

976
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,680
Were you headed to that shoe closet?

977
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,200
What? Why am I here?

978
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,400
I should be in the basement of the building with a yard.

979
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,480
Basement? I guess it's locked.

980
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,360
We can't get into locked spaces, you know.

981
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,320
That's why we come out through stinky bathroom stalls at times.

982
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,640
- Exactly. - Yes.

983
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,560
- A bank vault will be awesome. - Totally.

984
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,720
- "Show Me the Money". - "Show Me the Money".

985
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,200
Why is it kept locked? I can't even get in there.

986
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,200
Then go open it so that you can go in there whenever you want.

987
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,520
What a nuisance.

988
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,399
Gosh, that temper.

989
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,720
What's in there?

990
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,359
They must've put up this steel door and locked it for a reason.

991
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,439
What's inside? I can't see a thing.

992
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,120
I don't even see anything.

993
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,120
("Moojin Time Mart Collapsed")

994
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,279
("The Collapse Killed 300 People")

995
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,840
("The Bereaved Are Protesting Demanding the Truth to Be Revealed")

996
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,640
I thought maybe this could help you regain your memory.

997
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,400
It's Han Moo Gang.

998
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,920
Well, is this working? Good.

999
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,120
Introduce yourself.

1000
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,880
I'm 14 years old, and my name is Kim Sun Young.

1001
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,400
All right. Take your clothes off now.

1002
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,400
What are you doing here now?

1003
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,560
I'll do it.

1004
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,520
What?

1005
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,400
I'll do what you asked me to do.

1006
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,560
I'll stay by your side at all times.

1007
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,920
I'll be glued to you.

1008
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,680
Is that right?

1009
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,600
I'm glad to hear that.

1010
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,320
So let's save his life.

1011
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,920
Let's try to save that boy's life together.

1012
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,680
(Black)

1013
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,640
I clearly saw a stamp on the bandage...

1014
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,600
on the guy who will kill Geon Young.

1015
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,680
Are you sure that the shadow was inside that kid's body?

1016
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,080
Ms. Fortune-teller, how do you even know this piece of trash?

1017
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,360
You're keeping an eye on him, right?

1018
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,480
He disappeared when his mom went to the bathroom.

1019
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,000
No one can save his life.

1020
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
That's...

1021
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,040
No.

1022
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,560
Give Geon Young back!

1023
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,000
Don't you know what will happen when you meddle in humans' affairs?

1024
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,560
I never meddled in anything.
