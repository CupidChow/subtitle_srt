00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,920
(Episode 1)

2
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,520
Is this me?

3
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,640
This is me?

4
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,280
This is really me?

5
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,680
(Black)

6
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,680
- Guys, hurry up. - Yes, sir.

7
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,800
These idiots. Why didn't they fold this in?

8
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,360
- Move over. We don't have time. - Please move out of the way.

9
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Please cooperate.

10
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,160
- I'm sorry. - What is going on?

11
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,440
Hurry up already!

12
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,800
If you're going to loiter around, just go play golf instead.

13
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,880
- Where's the body? - This way, sir.

14
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
Gosh, this rain.

15
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,360
Would you say it's well preserved?

16
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,560
It's been left for too long, but we're trying.

17
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,680
From the size of his skull, the temporal bone,

18
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,920
and skullcap, I'm convinced that it's a male.

19
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm not sure exactly when he died,

20
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,160
but I think it happened just over a decade ago.

21
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,240
A decade?

22
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
- Look at this mess. - Gosh.

23
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,800
Hey, hey!

24
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,200
You idiot!

25
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,480
Han Moo Gang, that loser. How many times has he done this?

26
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
You just ruined the evidence!

27
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,080
- Gosh! - This is crazy.

28
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,240
Get lost.

29
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
Gosh, that idiot.

30
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,560
What on earth did he eat? Goodness.

31
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,080
You idiot! Had you closed your teeth together,

32
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,520
only the liquid would've come out!

33
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,400
He actually threw up food. Gosh.

34
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,840
I'm so annoyed right now.

35
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
What's the cause of death?

36
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
Judging from the crack in the skull, I think he was murdered.

37
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,920
Gosh, seriously.

38
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,640
Why did they partner me up with that loser?

39
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,760
That guy will ruin my career.

40
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

41
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
What is...

42
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,159
What is this?

43
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,280
What do you think this is?

44
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,640
Your stomach must be empty because you threw up everything.

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Let's grab a quick bite here. We have the team dinner later.

46
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,560
I'll get a barbecue burger and soda.

47
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,480
I don't have any appetite right now.

48
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,040
Why? You don't feel like eating because you just saw skeletons?

49
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,160
You better go in before I make you gulp down bone soup.

50
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,840
Didn't you say you were feeling queasy?

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
It's been a long time, Ha Ram.

52
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,440
How long has it been?

53
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,440
773 days and 5 hours.

54
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,360
Your order?

55
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
The shrimp burger couple set.

56
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,600
Signature.

57
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,440
Your order?

58
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,760
- Pardon me? - Your order.

59
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh, one barbecue burger...

60
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,560
and soda, please. By any chance,

61
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,800
can I order half a cup of Americano? I can't, right?

62
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
Then I'll just get that.

63
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,320
- Hey! - Yes? I wanted to use up my change.

64
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
Gosh, that startled me.

65
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
I told you to take that off.

66
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,240
It'll repel customers!

67
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,480
They'll find me even more repulsive without it.

68
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
For goodness' sake.

69
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,000
Is this funny to you?

70
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,200
You little... Do you think this is a joke?

71
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
Your order?

72
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,720
Your order?

73
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,200
- Sorry? - Are you deaf?

74
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,600
Finish your order. One barbecue burger and what?

75
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,960
I'll get one barbecue burger and soda.

76
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,320
Is it really not possible to order just half a cup of Americano?

77
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,680
What are you looking at?

78
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,960
Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?

79
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
Or shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?

80
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,159
Here's your shrimp burger couple set.

81
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
Stay for three more minutes.

82
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,360
What are you doing?

83
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,760
- Just three more minutes. - What are you saying? Let go.

84
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,640
Then wait for just a minute.

85
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,680
Stay here for just one minute.

86
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,159
What is it again? What?

87
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,600
It was my mom last time. Is it me now?

88
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,720
You haven't changed at all.

89
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,880
Do you know why I dumped you?

90
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,760
It's because you bring misfortune.

91
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,440
Let go of me.

92
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
Oh, my goodness!

93
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
- Oh, no! - What just happened?

94
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,520
He must be dead.

95
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,840
What's wrong with that woman?

96
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,840
(Die hard! Never die!)

97
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,160
(For unfortunate days)

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Are you okay? It must've startled you.

99
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Well, I've been through this a lot.

100
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,960
Oh, my. This isn't so nice of me to drink it alone.

101
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,520
Would you like some?

102
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,080
Why do you look like that?

103
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,800
Did something happen?

104
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,200
Something?

105
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,240
Something happened indeed.

106
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Do you remember Dong Won?

107
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,840
I saw him after 773 days and 5 hours.

108
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,240
What a coincidence to run into him at a burger place.

109
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,560
But...

110
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,840
he said...

111
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm unfortunate.

112
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,400
Gosh, how ridiculous. He's the unfortunate one.

113
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,840
I told him to stay for one minute.

114
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,360
Why did he have to leave?

115
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,680
I lost my grip...

116
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,520
when he said I bring misfortune.

117
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
I should've stopped him.

118
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,000
Did he die because of me?

119
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Did he really die because...

120
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
I bring misfortune?

121
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,400
That's right.

122
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,720
It's because of me.

123
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,640
I think it is. He died because of me.

124
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,360
It's all my fault.

125
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,560
Dad.

126
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,200
Dad!

127
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

128
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,680
Why does it only happen to me? Why?

129
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,760
It's okay. You're okay.

130
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,080
Ha Ram, don't worry.

131
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,280
Daddy will make your eyes okay.

132
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,880
Ta-da. It's a magical pair of sunglasses.

133
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,560
If you wear these, you won't see any of the scary stuff.

134
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
If I wear these,

135
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,240
will I really not see the scary things?

136
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
You won't.

137
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,680
Dad.

138
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,120
I can't watch it anymore.

139
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,360
I can't do this anymore.

140
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm sorry, sir.

141
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
You brat.

142
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,320
Hey, you should eat.

143
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,920
I heard you've been throwing up all day.

144
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,520
Your stomach must be empty.

145
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,680
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,080
We have the liver, heart,

147
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
and intestine.

148
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,680
Gosh, look at this. It's the tongue.

149
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,480
There must be some tongue in beef tripe and intestine soup.

150
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,680
What? Oh, goodness.

151
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,480
Look at this.

152
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,920
It's an eye.

153
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,560
This is a delicacy, you know.

154
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,040
It's so juicy.

155
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,880
Hey, hey.

156
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,360
Where are you going?

157
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,360
Why did you stick a bean in a quail egg and trick him?

158
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,680
He got shocked and ran away.

159
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,520
Who hired that brat?

160
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,200
You did.

161
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,440
Give me someone else as a partner!

162
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
- It looks good. - Eat up.

163
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,720
Hey.

164
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,960
What are you doing?

165
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,680
- What is this? - What are you doing, you punk?

166
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,080
- Boss! - Oh, no.

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,000
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,200
We'll kill you.

169
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
Let go of me.

170
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,680
Get up. Get up, you punk.

171
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,960
- You little... - Darn it.

172
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,320
- Hey. No! - Don't...

173
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
Why are you doing this to me?

174
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,080
Come here, punk!

175
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Hey, move.

176
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,840
You punk. Come here.

177
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,800
Hey!

178
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,720
The detectives are having a team dinner here.

179
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,480
What's with all the noise? I'll arrest you all for...

180
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,360
What are you doing over there, Moo Gang?

181
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,120
Detective Han.

182
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,560
Detective?

183
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,600
How dare you beat him up like that?

184
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,440
- What's going on? - Get them!

185
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
- Hey! - How dare you!

186
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,960
Gosh, it's red bean noodle soup.

187
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,200
It's your birthday today.

188
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,680
I made some since it's your favorite.

189
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,640
It'll be good.

190
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Oh, right. Moo Gang. Look over there.

191
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,680
That's your birthday present.

192
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
What?

193
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,520
Present?

194
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,360
You didn't have to.

195
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,120
What is this?

196
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,760
This is a limited edition for the 40th anniversary of "Robot Jjippa".

197
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,000
Gosh, they're not even in the stores yet.

198
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,280
Moo Gang. Here.

199
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,480
Mother says it's your medicine for this month.

200
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,840
My medicine?

201
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,640
I guess I should take it.

202
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,400
You should call your mother more often.

203
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
I know.

204
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
But she doesn't answer my calls anyway.

205
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,120
Can't you reconsider?

206
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,400
Do you have to be a detective? You aren't cut out for it.

207
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,120
- Your mother hates it so much. - I'm starving.

208
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
I'll go wash up.

209
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
Gosh, it smells fantastic.

210
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,560
Hi. Did you look into it?

211
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,520
Yes.

212
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,079
Oh, that's right. The picture.

213
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,000
Hold on.

214
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board.

215
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,680
I'm your captain, Yoky Raine,

216
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,000
and our destination is Helsinki, Finland.

217
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
We'll now be preparing for takeoff.

218
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,200
My sunglasses. Where did my sunglasses go?

219
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,320
Hi, sweetie. That's mine. Give it back.

220
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,640
- I don't want to. - You don't want to?

221
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Don't say that. You have to give it back.

222
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,200
Please take it off and give it back. You'll be in trouble. Come on.

223
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,560
I don't want to!

224
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,160
Stop! Stop immediately! Don't take off!

225
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,880
You need to stop. Right now!

226
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Stop this airplane immediately!

227
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,320
- What's the problem? Calm down. - No.

228
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,680
No, no!

229
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,720
Go away! Get away from me!

230
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,000
Go away! I said, go away!

231
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
You cannot let this plane take off. You absolutely shouldn't.

232
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,320
This airplane must not take off!

233
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,680
Open this door! Right now!

234
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Stop this airplane.

235
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,880
Get off. You all need to get off. The plane can't take off!

236
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,480
Everyone will die!

237
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,240
Please believe me!

238
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,760
Mister.

239
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,000
This is hers.

240
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,640
Please, no.

241
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,000
We can't let the plane take off. It cannot take off!

242
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,240
Everyone on that plane will die!

243
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Breaking news. A Helsinki-bound airplane that left...

244
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,280
Incheon International Airport at 6am today...

245
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
- crashed while flying over... - Hey, everyone died.

246
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,360
Hey, Man Soo. Will that affect you at all?

247
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,960
Aren't you in the insurance department?

248
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,320
That has nothing to do with...

249
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,000
- It actually will affect me a lot. - I'm doing it right now!

250
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,720
There would be a ton of work if it was a full flight.

251
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,520
What should I do? Gosh.

252
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,760
You guys! Can't you see that it's a state of emergency?

253
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,640
Aren't you watching the news?

254
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
How can you get drunk in broad daylight and make prank calls?

255
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,880
Look at him. Does his face look okay to you?

256
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,440
It's totally beaten up.

257
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,480
Gosh, I really didn't do anything.

258
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,680
I only said that he shouldn't make prank calls.

259
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,480
He's right. Those two guys beat him up.

260
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,280
That loser just tried to stop the fight.

261
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,080
Anyway, I absolutely will not settle.

262
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,880
I'll be sure to put these jerks behind bars.

263
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,520
What? A global star, a corporate heir, and a sports star?

264
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,040
Brace yourselves. I'll tell reporters everything!

265
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,840
- You jerk. - How dare you!

266
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,200
- Bring it on! - Break it up!

267
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,160
Hey, why are you going through the list of missing men?

268
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,280
Do we already have the DNA test results?

269
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,600
Gosh, seriously.

270
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,880
Didn't Moo Gang tell you when he was dropping this off?

271
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,920
So it's a woman. He didn't say anything.

272
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,960
What happened?

273
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Oh, no.

274
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,280
Are you okay?

275
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
I'm sorry.

276
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,520
Hey, you really don't know what this is?

277
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,640
Are you clueless or dumb?

278
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,280
Hey, do this with your hands.

279
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,880
- Like this? - That's the ready position.

280
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,280
Stay just like that, okay?

281
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,680
Now, put them over your chest.

282
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,200
- Oh, these are women's... - That's right, you idiot.

283
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,240
How can these not have rotten when the victim died over 10 years ago?

284
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,200
Silicone doesn't decay even after a century, you dimwit.

285
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,240
Gosh, didn't you go to an elite university in the States?

286
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,440
Hey, be honest with me.

287
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,800
You must've faked your academic credentials.

288
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,040
I studied accounting which has nothing to do with any of this.

289
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,400
You're such a loser. Why did you study accounting out of everything?

290
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,120
There's no match.

291
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,520
- Nothing at all? - No.

292
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,040
I went through the missing women records from the last 20 years,

293
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,400
but there's no match.

294
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
What is it, then?

295
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,600
This woman probably wasn't even reported missing.

296
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,120
By the way, where will we find the information we need?

297
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,760
About what?

298
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,360
The skeletons we found. She wasn't found in our data base.

299
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,360
Hey, they say that there's more than one way to skin a cat.

300
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,600
You see the numbers on them, right?

301
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,280
- Right there. That's it. - Yes.

302
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
It's the manufacturer's serial number.

303
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,520
That number will tell us the manufacturer name, which hospital...

304
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,840
they supplied to, and the name of the patient who got the surgery,

305
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,120
so go find out everything.

306
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,280
The numbers got erased because these are old.

307
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,800
Gosh, do you have all the time in the world or what?

308
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,720
Hey, who can decipher things that are not even visible?

309
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,000
What do you mean?

310
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,920
The eyes of the Six Million Dollar Man.

311
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,880
The ears of the Bionic Woman. Don't you know?

312
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,240
All detectives must have such abilities.

313
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,680
Anyhow, find out no matter what. You got that?

314
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,520
Okay.

315
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,120
Am I supposed to laugh or what?

316
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,760
Don't touch me, pervert!

317
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,480
Get your hands off of me.

318
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,720
- Are you going to keep this up? - Let go! Let go of me first.

319
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,680
- Let go! - Who is that woman?

320
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,120
Let go of me first! I said, let go!

321
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,000
- Tidy up, guys. - Let go of me, please!

322
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm serious. I didn't do anything.

323
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Then why did you get off the plane just before takeoff?

324
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,240
I didn't get off voluntarily. I was dragged out.

325
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
How did you know that everyone would die?

326
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,240
Answer me! Are you a terrorist?

327
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,200
How did you know about the crash if it wasn't your doing?

328
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,480
Hey, Miss!

329
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,320
This is a very serious matter!

330
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,400
You must tell me the truth for me to help you.

331
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,600
How did you know that everyone would die?

332
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,080
I saw the shadow.

333
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What?

334
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
The shadow.

335
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,680
I can see the shadow of death.

336
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,680
I've never seen so many of them before.

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
She can foresee death?

338
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,680
Oh, she's...

339
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,680
I saw her at the burger joint.

340
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,680
Gosh, honey! Honey.

341
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,800
What on earth happened? Gosh, honey.

342
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,920
Who's the jerk that did this to you? How can you beat up someone's face?

343
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,120
How could you do this?

344
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
- Ma'am. - Hey!

345
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,680
You're very beautiful.

346
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,160
Gosh, hello.

347
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,880
Do I know you?

348
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,880
I work as an insurance planner at Royal Insurance.

349
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,720
My name is Han Jin Sook.

350
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,800
She's your employee?

351
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,680
That's great. Just compensate them well.

352
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,120
- What did you just say? - Gosh, please don't do this!

353
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,440
- Let go! - Gosh!

354
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,880
- My goodness. - Are you okay?

355
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

356
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,720
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine.

357
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,280
- Calm down. - Gosh, these jerks.

358
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,640
Will you guys settle or not?

359
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,280
Pardon me? Oh, let's just settle, honey.

360
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,120
- What are you talking about? - Yes. We'll settle.

361
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,880
- Take them and get them to sign it. - Yes, sir.

362
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,880
- I won't settle. - Go on. Let's go.

363
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,960
Yes, we're coming.

364
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,600
That woman has it too.

365
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,520
What? She has what?

366
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,880
The shadow.

367
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,600
The shadow of death.

368
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,640
She'll die soon too.

369
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,840
Is she a fortune-teller?

370
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
Oh, right.

371
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,760
Shoot.

372
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,800
You didn't send a car?

373
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,440
I waited for a while.

374
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,200
Well, it's fine. I can use my two legs, you know.

375
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,560
Stop wasting your life. I want you to take over Insurance.

376
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,960
Sorry? Insurance?

377
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,720
You mean, Royal Insurance?

378
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,720
Are you asking me to...

379
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,520
Gosh, thank you so much. I'll do my very best. Thank you.

380
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,280
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,800
Think of your position and behave.

382
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,400
I don't expect much from you.

383
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,000
Just don't ruin the image of Royal.

384
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,640
Of course not.

385
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,120
I will make Royal Insurance the best insurance company...

386
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,000
in our country. Thank you.

387
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,320
Royal Insurance.

388
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,680
These are all so expensive.

389
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,880
Thank you.

390
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880
I don't care who you are.

391
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,320
Thank you...

392
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,680
Is someone sick?

393
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,800
Hey.

394
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,320
I told you not to watch it in front of the dog.

395
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,240
You have your own laptop. Why do you always use mine?

396
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,320
Dad locked my laptop.

397
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,960
Don't be so happy, Uncle Man Soo.

398
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,400
I know that you're an outcast of our family,

399
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,000
but how can you know so little about how things are at the company?

400
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
You just turned 30 now.

401
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,760
Do you think it makes sense that you'll be the president...

402
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,960
of Royal Insurance?

403
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,000
You just don't know how capable I am.

404
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,920
Dad and the board of directors...

405
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,680
teamed up and made you the representative.

406
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,920
What?

407
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,560
I overheard Mom and Dad talking on the phone.

408
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,120
They said Royal Insurance is a big nuisance now.

409
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,400
They had to pay tens of millions of dollars when there was a fire at...

410
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,920
Samjeong Department Store last year.

411
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,720
They have to pay a lot again because of today's plane accident.

412
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,200
I knew they shouldn't have insured foreign airlines.

413
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,840
Gosh, your dad.

414
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,320
Anyway,

415
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,680
they will sell it to China before it goes bankrupt.

416
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,800
That means you've become...

417
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,240
the captain of a ship that will sink soon.

418
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,720
Good luck.

419
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
He's going to blame me...

420
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,280
for its insolvency and sell the company?

421
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,320
That means...

422
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,560
he wants me to take all the blame.

423
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,840
Gosh, I knew it.

424
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,320
You sensed it was strange too, right?

425
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,520
What's wrong with your face?

426
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,000
Why do you have gunk in your eye? Are you sick?

427
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,360
This isn't your department. Why do you keep hovering around?

428
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,480
Well... What happened to that woman?

429
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Did you release her?

430
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,240
Who? You mean the crazy girl?

431
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,480
Is she really crazy? What did she say?

432
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
She's exercising her right to remain silent.

433
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,240
She won't say anything.

434
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,160
Where is she? Where is that crazy girl?

435
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,520
Where did that crazy girl go?

436
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,680
You. You brat.

437
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,960
What nonsense did you rattle on again this time? What?

438
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,880
My goodness, you crazy wench!

439
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,640
Let's just kill ourselves together today.

440
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,000
- Let's just die! - Stop!

441
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,480
Please calm down.

442
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
If you want to kill yourself, go ahead.

443
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,040
I'm strong enough to survive alone from that plane,

444
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,880
so if you want to die, die alone!

445
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
You and your darn mouth.

446
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,560
You wench. I told you to keep your mouth shut.

447
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,840
I told you to keep your eyes closed!

448
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,720
You crazy wench!

449
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,600
That crazy wench.

450
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,400
- Goodness. - Please have a seat here.

451
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,520
Oh, gosh.

452
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,160
Here, please sit.

453
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,120
That girl isn't normal.

454
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,680
She's insane.

455
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,200
(Seoun Police Station)

456
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,960
What is this?

457
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,240
You're awake.

458
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,760
It was broken, so I fixed it.

459
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,920
Listen.

460
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Do you remember me by any chance?

461
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,480
I saw you a few days ago.

462
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,600
At the burger place on the day of the truck accident.

463
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,280
I don't know.

464
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,480
Wait.

465
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,960
Why do you always cover your eyes? They're beautiful.

466
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,560
You have beautiful eyes.

467
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,480
Why do you always cover them? They're beautiful.

468
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,240
Do you wear sunglasses to avoid seeing the shadows?

469
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,920
Did you hear it?

470
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,440
Yes.

471
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,640
Do you believe me?

472
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,320
Not exactly,

473
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,440
but that's what you said.

474
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,200
Do you not see the shadows if you wear them?

475
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,320
Shadows are black.

476
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,560
When I wear black sunglasses, I don't see them.

477
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,880
At the burger place the other day,

478
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,600
did your ex-boyfriend...

479
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,360
I mean...

480
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,920
Well... Did the guy in the accident have...

481
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,160
a shadow as well?

482
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,680
Did you also know that he'd be hit by a truck and die?

483
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,280
How?

484
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,639
If I touch the shadow,

485
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,960
I can see the moment that person dies.

486
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,320
What?

487
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,960
I saw him getting hit by a truck and die,

488
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,120
so I tried to make him stay until the truck passes.

489
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,280
You don't believe me, do you?

490
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,239
You say you see shadows, and it's just a little funny...

491
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,280
No, I believe you.

492
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,679
I believe you, of course.

493
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,760
The little girl who sat next to me on the plane.

494
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,400
I should've gotten off the plane with her at least.

495
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,679
I can't stop thinking about her.

496
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,400
My eyes are cursed.

497
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,240
People are right.

498
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,200
I'm a cursed monster.

499
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,920
That's...

500
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,080
It has been revealed...

501
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,360
that the cause of the recent plane crash...

502
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,040
was not an act of terrorism,

503
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,640
but a defect of the aircraft.

504
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,560
The airline and the investigation officials analyzed the blackbox...

505
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,680
and the debris from the crash.

506
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,400
They confirmed that...

507
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,640
a part of the compressor inside the engine was broken.

508
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,200
It was a defect in the aircraft.

509
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,680
They concluded that the crash occurred due to the defect.

510
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,480
I can just smash the heads of those jerks.

511
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,320
They accused an innocent person of being a terrorist.

512
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,360
I will report you all to the UN's human rights office.

513
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,360
Hi. I heard the news on my way to work.

514
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,120
I'm glad the misunderstanding cleared up.

515
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,560
Are you going home?

516
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,920
Give me a ride home, please.

517
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,840
No, I just came to work...

518
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,320
Excuse me.

519
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,560
No one gets off work in the morning.

520
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,800
You see,

521
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,520
I'm a very precious son to my parents.

522
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,160
I'm a third-generation only son.

523
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,680
When I was little, my mom set up a different table just for me.

524
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,400
My gosh, she's giving me all kinds of trouble.

525
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,000
There he goes again.

526
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,040
He's going to die.

527
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,080
I can see a shadow.

528
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,080
What?

529
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,280
He is Leo's manager.

530
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,680
Do you know him?

531
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,400
Don't worry. He will never jump.

532
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,280
He's famous around here.

533
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,000
He's been up on this bridge every morning for the last two years.

534
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,760
A few months ago,

535
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,000
he was doing the same thing,

536
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,440
and he missed his step.

537
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,000
He actually almost fell off the bridge.

538
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,640
Then he hung on to the handrail,

539
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,000
and he wouldn't stop crying out for help.

540
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,240
Gosh, he will never kill himself.

541
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,280
Don't you worry.

542
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,280
You said you believe me. You're a big fat liar.

543
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
What?

544
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,600
Whatever. I don't care.

545
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,960
I'm not a big fat liar.

546
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,000
I thought he was going to get a job at a celebrity agency.

547
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,480
Did he get fired already?

548
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,800
What?

549
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,360
What's her problem?

550
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,280
Gosh, I'm late.

551
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,760
Something urgent came up, so I'm on my way to work now.

552
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,520
You lazy punk.

553
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,280
Hey, did you find out the number on that silicon?

554
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,400
A professional told me that it could be restored.

555
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,640
We just need to wait a little...

556
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
My gosh, what a bad temper.

557
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,080
(I know you don't believe me, you jerk!)

558
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,240
"Jerk"?

559
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,960
How did she get a hold of my number?

560
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,080
I can't believe he's still there.

561
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,560
What?

562
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,680
- My gosh. - He fell.

563
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,080
What should we do?

564
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,680
Call 911.

565
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,360
- My gosh. - I can't believe this.

566
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,360
Ji Dong!

567
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,440
- My goodness! - Please calm down.

568
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,400
Ji Dong!

569
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,760
My son!

570
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,720
I can't believe this!

571
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,800
- Mom, stop. - My gosh!

572
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,280
- Mom. - My goodness.

573
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,400
I can't believe this!

574
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,040
Mom, stop it.

575
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,400
That person's going to die.

576
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,000
I can see shadows.

577
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,920
She was right.

578
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,840
She can foresee death.

579
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,120
He died.

580
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,760
He really jumped off that bridge and died.

581
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,040
I told you so.

582
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,840
He was a really nice and diligent guy.

583
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,720
If I had listened to you,

584
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,840
I could've saved him.

585
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,760
It's all my fault.

586
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,920
I practically killed him myself.

587
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,240
My gosh, I'm so dumb!

588
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,080
How am I going to reveal the truth like this?

589
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,880
What? "The truth"?

590
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,160
How did you endure it?

591
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,360
How did you endure it?

592
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,080
This was just my first time.

593
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,640
But you must've lived with this feeling all your life.

594
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,520
Get lost.

595
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,240
Or I'm going to stick that soju bottle into your eyes.

596
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,080
- No. - What do you mean?

597
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,160
You're not a cursed monster.

598
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,040
What you have...

599
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,480
is a gift.

600
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,600
It's not a curse.

601
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,440
The fact that you can foresee someone's death...

602
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,280
is a really cool thing because that means you can save people's lives.

603
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,040
My gosh, what are you doing?

604
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,960
Let's work together.

605
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,240
Let's save lives.

606
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,600
You should prove it to yourself that what you have...

607
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,400
is actually a gift, not a curse.

608
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,680
Stop running away like a fool.

609
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
That's enough. Get lost.

610
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,760
That kid who sat next to you.

611
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,360
You said you can't get her out of your head.

612
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,600
You felt uneasy about having left her on that plane.

613
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,920
Let's save lives together...

614
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,760
so that no one will have to die such a sudden death.

615
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,720
Let's work together.

616
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,720
Okay?

617
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,120
If it's too hard on your own,

618
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,680
I'll help you.

619
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Okay?

620
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,920
Come on.

621
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,800
Hey.

622
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,000
Can you...

623
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,040
move your feet?

624
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,720
Let's work together just once.

625
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,480
If you're not sure about it,

626
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,080
why don't you give it a try just once?

627
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,080
Just once.

628
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,200
My gosh, he's so loud.

629
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,840
Just do it for him already.

630
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,320
My gosh, let me get some sleep. You're so loud.

631
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,360
You heard what she said, right?

632
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,960
Just once.

633
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,920
Let's work together just once.

634
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,360
Just once.

635
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,920
Please?

636
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
Just once.

637
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,760
- Let's do it just once. - Let's go.

638
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,080
- Gosh, we need to do it. - Get inside.

639
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,200
My gosh, stop playing hard to get!

640
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,160
- Let's do it just once. - Shut it.

641
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,760
That crazy jerk.

642
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
You said you can't get her out of your head.

643
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,560
You felt uneasy about having left her on that plane.

644
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,160
Let's save lives together so that no one will have to...

645
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,920
die such a sudden death.

646
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,040
Who am I going to save?

647
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,680
I couldn't even save my own dad.

648
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,280
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

649
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,880
Moo Gang.

650
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,280
You punk.

651
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,800
I heard someone reported you yesterday for causing a fuss...

652
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,520
in front of their house after getting drunk.

653
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,920
What?

654
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,680
Oh, that? No, that's not what it was.

655
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,080
There was a slight misunderstanding.

656
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,600
My gosh, you're a disgrace to our police station.

657
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,200
What was the number on that silicon?

658
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,960
Well, I figured out the hospital that bought it.

659
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,160
But the doctor was busy doing a surgery,

660
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,600
and they said they'll call me back after...

661
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,000
You jerk!

662
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,360
Since when did detectives give people the option to call back?

663
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,160
Do you think you're a realtor or something?

664
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,120
- But he was in surgery... - When is he going to call you?

665
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,840
- In 1, 2, 3. - I'll go see him right now.

666
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,480
My gosh, what's he doing with this brain?

667
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,320
What am I going to do with him? My goodness gracious.

668
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,800
What's this?

669
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,360
It's the 1997 Moojin Fire Accident.

670
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,160
He can't even take care of a case that happened two days ago.

671
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,200
Why is he looking into something that happened 20 years ago?

672
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,760
It was used 20 years ago.

673
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,160
I just found the patient records.

674
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,400
Let's see.

675
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,760
This patient got more than just a breast implant.

676
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,840
He also got her thing removed.

677
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,560
"Her thing"?

678
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,640
Do you mean she went through a sex reassignment surgery?

679
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,560
So that's why his name wasn't on the missing persons list.

680
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,560
She also got cosmetic surgery on her face.

681
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,120

682

Tell me. Did you find anything out?

686
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,880
No.

687
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,240
I think he was mistaken about the serial number.

688

Yes, that's right.

What? Why is it ripped out?

00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,240
It seems like it got ripped out a long time ago.

Are only soon-to-be graduates obligated to take this photo?

No, everyone's obligated to take that photo.

01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,480
I don't have an easy life, okay?

831
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,760
Gosh, this isn't working. All right, I'll be generous today.

832
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,200
I'll give you your pay...

833
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,360
for today,

834
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,640
so don't go anywhere. Stay right here with me.

835
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,080
I put in an extra 10-dollar bill.

836
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,600
You're a gold digger, aren't you?

837
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,440
You little... Get lost!

838
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,040
You're investing this 100 dollars to rip me off big time later on.

839
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,480
You treat money like garbage.

840
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,680
Whatever. I did my best.

841
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,760
I don't care whether you die or not.

842
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,600
Jerk, how dare you call me a gold digger?

843
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,760
Hey, did you leave your eyeballs at home or what?

844
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,040
And what kind of gold digger would target an old blue-collar like you?

845
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,760
Have you completely lost your mind?

846
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,680
Go ahead. Hit me. Punch me.

847
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,560
- Hit me. I'd rather get hit. - Go away, you wench.

848
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,280
- Mister, just punch me. Wait. - I said, go away. Let go.

849
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,560
Help! This man is trying to run away after hitting me.

850
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,240
- Let go! - No, you can't go!

851
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,400
Gosh, are you insane?

852
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,440
Blood... Blood.

853
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,960
I'm bleeding. That man is trying to run away after hitting me.

854
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,720
Please call the police! I'm bleeding.

855
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,840
Look at this blood. Gosh, I'm bleeding!

856
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,360
Please catch him!

857
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,120
Hey!

858
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,120
- Let go! - Gosh.

859
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,680
Goodness.

860
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,440
- Miss, what's going on? - Arrest this man.

861
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,480
- You need to arrest him now. - Why? What happened?

862
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,200
- Well... - Make sure he can't move.

863
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,440
- What did he do? - He hit me.

864
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,360
- He hit you? - Yes.

865
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,200
- Do something. - Wait!

866
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,840
I didn't do anything! That woman is a gold digger!

867
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,360
I'm telling you. She's a gold digger. Officer!

868
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,360
Officer.

869
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,120
Here.

870
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,800
What are you doing here? You said you can't come.

871
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,080
I had to come because you said you'd pull out my eyeballs.

872
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,320
That must hurt a lot.

873
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,240
I don't want to die like that.

874
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,920
Do you even know what I went through to find you?

875
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,040
Give me your phone.

876
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,360
Come on.

877
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,480
(Han Moo Gang, added to friends list)

878
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,920
What did you just do?

879
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,360
I don't want to go through hoops again just to find you.

880
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,840
Whatever. You're the one who didn't come when I asked you to.

881
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,920
You just can't talk nicely, can you?

882
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,520
Great, it's done. Here you go.

883
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,160
You hurt yourself, didn't you?

884
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,800
To get him locked up in a holding cell to make sure he's safe.

885
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,560
Aren't I right?

886
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,440
Well, are you really a detective?

887
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,280
You tripped and fell because you can't even walk properly.

888
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,120
You should just quit being a detective.

889
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,960
I'm actually planning to quit.

890
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,880
Well...

891
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,600
Well, you know. Everyone can...

892
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,240
trip and fall at times.

893
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,440
Getting your back stepped on happens too.

894
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,480
You're done, right? I'll get going, then.

895
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,240
Wait, no. You can't leave.

896
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,120
Well, what else do you need?

897
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,960
I don't think it'll end with that man.

898
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,320
Sorry?

899
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,520
Well,

900
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,600
I touched that man's shadow earlier.

901
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,440
Help me!

902
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,040
I'll kill this jerk!

903
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,560
Please come back to me.

904
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,800
Let go!

905
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,560
I'll really kill you, jerk.

906
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,440
There will be a hostage situation?

907
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,480
I think...

908
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,320
it was a shopping mall.

909
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,440
I saw an underwear store.

910
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,960
A gun. That's right, I think he was holding a gun.

911
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,600
I think it was 7pm.

912
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,360
He was wearing a military uniform.

913
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,800
A military uniform?

914
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,840
If he had a firearm on him, he must be a runaway soldier.

915
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,080
There's no news about a runaway soldier though.

916
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,840
Do you happen to know the date?

917
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,520
I'm not sure about that.

918
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,880
But if he's a runaway soldier, it means that anyone...

919
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,080
can be held hostage even though that man is safe.

920
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,560
Right.

921
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,200
We have to catch the runaway soldier to prevent that situation.

922
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,480
Do you know which shopping mall it was?

923
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,760
Try to remember what you saw.

924
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,200
Well...

925
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,160
I remember seeing a big clock on a wall.

926
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,920
Wait.

927
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,000
What is it?

928
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,120
It was 7 o'clock according to the soldier's watch,

929
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,240
but the clock was pointing at 9 o'clock.

930
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,520
7 o'clock... But...

931
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,360
But the clock on the wall was pointing at 9 o'clock?

932
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,640
A clock on a wall?

933
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,680
I think I know where it is.

934
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,000
What? It's a painting?

935
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,400
Is this it?

936
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,040
That means the incident will take place at this shopping mall at 7pm.

937
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,320
We don't know the date though.

938
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,360
Exactly. We need to know the date.

939
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,000
- It's today. - What?

940
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,680
That means we only have five hours.

941
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,000
What?

942
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,160
What's wrong?

943
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,560
That woman.

944
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,560
She was crying among the bystanders.

945
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,400
She must know something.

946
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,760
(Meet me now, or I'll kill everyone.)

947
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,399
I told him that I'm seeing someone else now...

948
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,279
and that I want him to stop clinging to me.

949
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,680
Yes, got it.

950
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,399
Okay.

951
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,240
Our guess was right. He ran away early this morning.

952
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,720
Why isn't it on the news though?

953
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,439
A number of sexual assault cases happened in the military, you know.

954
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,160
They're probably hushing it up and trying to track him down.

955
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:53,439
Miss,

956
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,880
please try to contact your boyfriend.

957
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,120
Tell him that you want to talk.

958
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,520
And you know what?

959
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,520
Your boyfriend must've been having a hard time in the military.

960
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,840
How can you cheat on him like that?

961
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,120
I would be furious too.

962
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,880
Have you been starving yourself or what?

963
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,120
Look at this.

964
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,600
You've had two servings already.

965
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,400
Hey, I'm here.

966
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,800
Hello.

967
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,000
Has everything been well with you?

968
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,400
Yes.

969
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,560
How have you been?

970
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,920
Good.

971
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,680
You said that you're seeing another guy.

972
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,280
It was a lie, right?

973
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,520
Excuse me. Do you have the time?

974
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,280
Sorry.

975
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,400
Gosh, what are you doing now?

976
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,080
I'm sorry. My apologies.

977
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,960
You were lying when you said that you're seeing someone else, right?

978
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,440
I'm sorry.

979
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,760
Why are you apologizing? Did you...

980
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,080
What? What are you doing now?

981
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,600
Well, I totally understand how you must be feeling now,

982
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,800
- but this is wrong. Let's go. - What?

983
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Hey.

984
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,400
- I'm really sorry. - Hey, how could you...

985
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,480
How could you do this to me?

986
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,680
Cheer up, okay?

987
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,360
There are so many women in this world.

988
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,000
Just forget about her and move on. There.

989
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,120
Go on in. Everything will be okay.

990
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,160
Oh, boy.

991
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,440
Gosh, that little...

992
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,920
People from his division said that they'll pick him up.

993
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,160
It's all over now.

994
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,160
I'm off.

995
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,760
Detective Han!

996
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,600
I know I told you to quit your job, but I take it back.

997
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,400
You were pretty helpful today.

998
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,920
All right. Bye.

999
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,600
Ha Ram!

1000
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:29,200
We did an incredible thing today.

1001
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,720
You know that, right?

1002
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,600
That ability you have...

1003
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,760
is a blessing, not a curse. I hope you know that now.

1004
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,040
Bye now.

1005
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,960
(Sunglasses)

1006
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,960
(Save)

1007
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,840
(Sorry, Moo Gang. It's my fault.)

1008
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,160
We did an incredible thing today.

1009
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,960
That ability you have...

1010
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,240
is a blessing, not a curse. I hope you know that now.

1011
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,880
It's been decided that the commemoration park...

1012
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,440
for the Moojin Time Mart collapse from 20 years ago that killed...

1013
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,960
300 people will be built on a mountain...

1014
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,760
near Moojin Elementary School after a long conflict.

1015
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,960
The construction will commence...

1016
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,080
- as early as next week. - What? My elementary school?

1017
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,280
- Since the location has been... - Gosh!

1018
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,280
Joon and I buried our time capsules in that mountain.

1019
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:57,080
- Royal Group... - Gosh, I should dig it up tomorrow.

1020
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,680
All eyes are on how the situation will unfold.

1021
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,400
My goodness.

1022
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,960
My body is aching all over from doing all that work.

1023
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,000
Shall I go to a sauna and get a body scrub?

1024
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,320
Oh, the bus is here.

1025
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,280
It's my phone.

1026
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,440
Please answer it for me.

1027
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,080
Hello?

1028
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,080
Yes. Just a moment, please.

1029
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,560
What was that? Was I imagining it or something?

1030
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:59,960
What just happened?

1031
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,960
That's so weird.

1032
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,560
(Loser, 17 missing calls)

1033
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,200
What?

1034
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,920
Did something happen?

1035
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,640
Did they get released?

1036
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,680
What's going on? He called me so many times.

1037
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,680
I put it around my toes and braided it all night to finish it.

1038
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,880
My dad says a red thread is the thread of fate.

1039
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,840
Really?

1040
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,160
Oh, wait here.

1041
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,760
What? Are you giving it to me?

1042
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,960
But you like it so much.

1043
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,200
That's why I'm giving it to you. Please keep it for me.

1044
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,600
Can I write you?

1045
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,040
(19-1, Myeonhee-dong, Mioh-gu, Seoul)

1046
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,120
Ha Ram, what do I always say?

1047
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,320
"You're a blessed girl."

1048
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,480
That's right. The ability you have is a blessing.

1049
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,240
Foreseeing deaths is...

1050
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,160
a great ability that you can save people's lives with.

1051
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,960
I'll write you often.

1052
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,640
Reply me. Don't forget me.

1053
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,440
Stay in touch, okay?

1054
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,080
Is this loser...

1055
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,440
really him?

1056
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,800
Actually,

1057
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,440
his lips and eyes look similar.

1058
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,600
I'm going to...

1059
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,680
become a detective.

1060
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,040
A cool detective like your dad.

1061
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,920
He really became a detective.

1062
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,560
Gosh, why didn't I recognize him?

1063
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,680
He's...

1064
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,560
(Republic of Korea Army)

1065
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,160
Why is there only one line?

1066
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,120
There were clearly two.

1067
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,000
The watch.

1068
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,400
He was wearing a watch on his right wrist.

1069
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,840
Excuse me. Where is the gun?

1070
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,560
He didn't have one on him when he deserted.

1071
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,440
Let's go.

1072
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,800
What?

1073
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,080
He's not the one.

1074
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,880
- Hello? A hostage situation? - Hello? Yes.

1075
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,800
What are you doing? Move it!

1076
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,880
Move it.

1077
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:49,720
We have breaking news. There is a hostage situation at a mall.

1078
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,400
The captor is in a military uniform, and he has a gun.

1079
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,280
It's highly likely that he's a soldier who deserted.

1080
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,000
The hostage is a man in his 30s.

1081
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,360
His identity remains unknown.

1082
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,760
Why is he...

1083
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,520
Why is Detective Han there?

1084
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,000
Why...

1085
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,720
Why is Detective Han there?

1086
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,520
- Why is he there? - Chief!

1087
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,640
Detective Han is the hostage. Come and look.

1088
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,640
What's going on?

1089
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,160
That's Detective Han, right?

1090
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,520
(The captor is a soldier, the victim of sexual assault.)

1091
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,240
He went to pick up my mom!

1092
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,400
It is said that Private Lee is not a deserter.

1093
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,320
Your mom?

1094
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,960
Please let me go.

1095
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,280
My mom has dementia.

1096
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,440
She's at a mall in Dongbaek-ri. Its name is Nine something.

1097
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,280
Anyway, they have her there.

1098
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,880
I have to go pick her up.

1099
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,320
You mean Nine PM?

1100
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,240
Is that why this man was there?

1101
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,800
Where in Nine PM are you at?

1102
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,000
Does this mean that man's fate...

1103
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,400
became Detective Han's?

1104
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,400
I'm really going to kill this guy!

1105
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,680
He went to the mall today...

1106
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,240
No. It can't be.

1107
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,760
When he was stopped by the guards, he took the man hostage.

1108
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,440
(The captor requests Senator Nam Joong Pyo to reveal the truth.)

1109
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,920
What? What happened?

1110
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,080
- Did Detective Han get shot? - Let's move now.

1111
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,360
What did I...

1112
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,400
What did I do?

1113
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,520
What on earth did I do?

1114
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,240
It's because of me.

1115
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,160
Doctor, please see this patient first.

1116
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,240
Moo Gang.

1117
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,240
Get the defibrillator ready.

1118
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,680
Scissors!

1119
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,600
Clear. Shock!

1120
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,200
Charge it again to 200 joules. Hurry.

1121
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,640
Clear. Shock!

1122
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,880
It has been revealed that the person the gun belonged to was...

1123
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,440
not Private Lee, but Detective Han Moo Gang, the hostage.

1124
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,280
Detective Han was taken to the hospital...

1125
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,800
I killed him.

1126
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,400
I killed him. I did it.

1127
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,720
I'm cursed.

1128
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,160
I should die.

1129
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,880
I should die.

1130
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,600
I should die.

1131
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,120
What?

1132
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,960
How dramatic.

1133
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,000
Gosh, humans.

1134
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,280
(Black)

1135
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,000
It will be a tragic end.

1136
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,640
First love, my foot. I don't need it.

1137
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,880
Hey, you!

1138
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,880
- Hey! - How can I lose this woman?

1139
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,160
She's so annoying.

1140
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:57,320
What's wrong with Moo Gang? He's like a completely different person.

1141
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,400
Who are you?

1142
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,560
You died that day, Han Moo Gang.
