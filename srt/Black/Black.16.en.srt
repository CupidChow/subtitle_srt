1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,000
Please wait one moment.

2
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,600
Please let me out, detective.

3
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,960
My mother has dementia.

4
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
A place called Nine something...

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,080
is taking care of her right now.

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,480
- Do you mean Nine PM? - Yes.

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
Was that why he was there?

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,800
Sir, please let me out. My mom needs me.

9
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,520
I can't let you go.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,080
I'll go see her if necessary.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,040
- Pardon? - Hello?

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,720
- Where at Nine PM are you? - Detective Han!

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,920
- Hello, Byeong Tae. - Moo Gang. The tape.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,920
A child fortune-teller took it.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,800
- A child fortune-teller? - Yes.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,000
According to the woman at the bar,

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,280
the child with sunglasses took it.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,600
Sunglasses?

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,200
I'll call you back.

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Could it be...

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
(To Kim Joon)

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,160
(When are you coming to Moojin? I miss you.)

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,320
(Sophia will come out soon. Will you live in Moojin then?)

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,080
I won't send him to Moojin.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,360
He'll always live with me!

26
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,120
I think I saw Ha Ram's name on that envelope.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,000
Please pick up.

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
All right.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,640
I must calm down. All right.

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,960
I'll find out once I get the tape.

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,760
That's right.

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Wait.

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Soo Wan.

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
Then what will happen to Soo Wan?

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
Oh, no.

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,400
Please pick up.

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,720
Please leave a message after the beep.

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,640
Soo Wan.

39
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,120
If I reveal the truth,

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,079
you'll be...

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,160
extremely hurt.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,840
However, I can't forgive them for what they did to my brother.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,480
I'm sorry, Soo Wan.

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,440
But please know this.

45
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,920
My feelings for you...

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
were real.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Okay.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Let's talk when everything is over. I'm sorry.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,360
Moo Gang. The tape.

50
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,480
A child fortune-teller took it.

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Ha Ram.

52
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,200
Were you the one who had it?

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,040
Hello?

54
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,120
Maybe it wasn't her.

55
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,040
I can check only if she picks up.

56
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,200
Moo Chan.

57
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
That child...

58
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,640
was Ha Ram indeed.

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
Ha Ram?

60
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,920
Who is this?

61
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,600
What?

62
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,480
(Loser)

63
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,840
Is something going on?

64
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,200
Stay still.

65
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,280
I'll shoot him if anybody moves.

66
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,160
It might be better...

67
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,600
if I just died here.

68
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,600
Don't hide, and come forward.

69
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,040
You! You!

70
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,320
Don't come close to me. I'll kill him for real.

71
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,200
- I will really kill him. - Shoot him.

72
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,320
No.

73
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,360
I can't just die like this.

74
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
I have to ask him.

75
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,440
I have to ask him how he could do such things.

76
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
I have to ask.

77
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,120
When he was on his way to pick up that old woman with dementia,

78
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,800
Han Moo Gang found out about the tape.

79
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,360
And he started to walk towards the other side of this shopping mall.

80
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,240
If he got the tape back then,

81
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,960
he should have arrested Kim Young Seok first.

82
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,120
Who did he meet at this hotel?

83
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,160
Why was the guest list of that day erased?

84
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,720
If you reveal my father's tape,

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,520
it would do no good to you, Han Moo Gang.

86
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Do you understand what I just said?

87
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,760
If you do anything unnecessary, all of you won't be safe.

88
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,880
Kim Sun Young and Han Moo Gang were there together.

89
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,560
Find out what they have talked about right now.

90
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,160
How did you get here, Detective Han?

91
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,680
Well, the door was open. I just came through it.

92
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,800
I think I saw you the other day at the columbarium in Moojin.

93
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Yes, I was there.

94
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,200
What I mean is...

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
I'll speak casually to you.

96
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,840
My brain isn't working well now because I got shot in the head.

97
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,800
I hope you get well soon.

98
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,520
Sure, I'll get well soon. Thank you.

99
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,160
My mind got clearer.

100
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,800
And my memories are coming back.

101
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,800
It's a good thing.

102
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
You know Kim Sun Young, right?

103
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,600
You have interviewed her before.

104
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
Could you tell me how she looks like?

105
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Well, it was so long ago. I can't remember it that well.

106
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
Right.

107
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,400
You just saw her once 20 years ago.

108
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,640
I heard that you were about to run for the presidency.

109
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,320
Well, I mean...

110
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,560
as I said earlier...

111
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,320
You are a hero who saved the children from that fire.

112
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm sure you'll do well.

113
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,320
Good luck to you.

114
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,360
Thanks.

115
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,480
Yes, you don't have to check about it anymore.

116
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,040
Kim Sun Young hasn't told him about anything.

117
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,520
And keep an eye on Han Moo Gang. His memories are coming back.

118
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,880
Make sure she brings back the tape. Stay close to her at all times.

119
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
He won't bother the doctor now.

120
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,120
His only target now is Han Moo Gang.

121
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,080
I don't understand this.

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,720
Hand in Oh Man Ho's case to the prosecutors now. Hurry up.

123
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,800
I've been looking for it, but Leo isn't related to Oh Man Ho at all.

124
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,480
Let the prosecutors find out about it, and hand in the case now.

125
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,840
Dear Captain Bong.

126
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,520
He's right. Just hand in the case. Let's leave it for now.

127
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,480
Why was Leo his target when Wang Young Choon wanted...

128
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,600
to take revenge on Oh Man Ho?

129
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,560
I've been looking for it so hard, but I don't know their relationship.

130
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,600
Because they are not related in any way.

131
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,840
Who are you to say this? Gosh.

132
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,960
Be careful, Moo Gang.

133
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,440
When I called you after running away from the guy who abducted me,

134
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,120
it was Kim Young Seok's agent who picked up the call.

135
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,760
An agent...

136
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,880
What?

137
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,600
Why?

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,360
It can't be those idiots.

139
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,960
No!

140
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,280
It's him.

141
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
Hey, then are you saying Oh Man Ho is not the suspect?

142
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
Stay quiet, Short-legged Grandpa.

143
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,960
- Hey! - You're old and tactless.

144
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,920
Don't call me that!

145
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,160
You... You...

146
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
- Hey, where are you going? - Hey!

147
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
- Han Moo Gang! - Where are you going? Seriously.

148
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,080
He hasn't called me even once since he left yesterday.

149
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,400
He's not picking up my calls either.

150
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,640
What happened to him?

151
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
What?

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,360
Detective Han.

153
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
Detective Han.

154
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,080
What is this?

155
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,080
Is that a thief?

156
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,480
What is going on?

157
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,720
You scumbag thief!

158
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,240
Ha Ram... Ha Ram. What are you doing here?

159
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,320
I was just...

160
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,600
Hey, what is this all about?

161
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,280
Get out.

162
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
What is this?

163
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,080
- Follow me. - But...

164
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
But I...

165
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,600
I keep telling you. I'm sure that they're dating each other.

166
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,880
They have something for sure.

167
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,720
Hey, why don't your hands shake when you are eating?

168
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
It's quite amazing.

169
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm just saying this because Han Moo Gang isn't here.

170
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,240
Look at that.

171
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,440
Gosh. When I looked at that for the first time,

172
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,120
I thought Han Moo Gang was totally insane.

173
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,960
I thought he was out of his mind and messed up with everything.

174
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,400
That's how I thought about it then. But now that I see it,

175
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,280
he must be a real genius. Don't you think so?

176
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,960
How could he think of that?

177
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,800
He's a smart man. He went to an Ivy League university.

178
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
Get out. Hurry now.

179
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,040
Go home now. Hurry up.

180
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,120
Why did you come here without calling me?

181
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,360
What do you mean?

182
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,800
I've kept calling you all day.

183
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,200
Are you mad at me?

184
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,880
It's not like that. Don't come here without calling me anymore.

185
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,200
Go home now. Move quickly.

186
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,120
Go now.

187
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,120
He's mad at me.

188
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,800
Did I do something wrong?

189
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,960
You're saying it's Kim Young Seok who killed them all, not Oh Man Ho.

190
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,600
He wanted to disguise the fact that he raped somebody.

191
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,960
He even killed Crazy Dog.

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,160
He killed Gwang Gyun too?

193
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,640
He realized that the rabbit chain he saw from the interview tape...

194
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,040
was the same...

195
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,760
as what he picked up from the crime scene...

196
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,080
20 years ago.

197
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
He's completely drunk.

198
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,040
- Goodness. - I'm sorry. Excuse me.

199
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,960
I am really sorry.

200
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,960
And Crazy Dog realized by instinct that the actual suspect...

201
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,600
behind all these crimes was Kim Young Seok, not Oh Man Ho.

202
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,320
So he went to see Kim Young Seok straight away to confront him.

203
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,040
I saw that interview tape...

204
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,000
and it had a very unique rabbit chain.

205
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,280
That rabbit chain on your bag.

206
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,680
My son made that for me.

207
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,720
He made one for himself, and he made another for me.

208
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,880
I'm sorry?

209
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,240
Do you...

210
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,200
have a son?

211
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,440
Yes. Since my wife died,

212
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,240
he's been staying with her family in Canada.

213
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,880
If he takes after you, he must be very handsome.

214
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,960
Gosh, my head hurts.

215
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,720
Listen.

216
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,120
That keychain. Can I see it now?

217
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,920
Well, I lost it.

218
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,160
When I was covering the Moojin Time Mart incident, I was so hectic.

219
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,119
By the way,

220
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,000
did you come here at this late hour to ask me about that?

221
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,480
And you seem to be quite drunk.

222
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,319
Well, I had a few drinks. We had a team dinner.

223
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,040
Anyway, that's not why I came here.

224
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm actually really thirsty right now.

225
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,640
Could you get me a cup of water?

226
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,360
Sure.

227
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,120
I'll be right back.

228
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,760
Gui Nam. Check Leo's family register and background.

229
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,800
See if he's related to Kim Young Seok.

230
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
(Captain Lee)

231
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,520
Crazy Dog just called Detective Park,

232
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,960
and I answered it instead.

233
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,640
I think he's suspicious of your son.

234
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,320
I'll send Chen.

235
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,440
Have Chen drive his car here.

236
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,200
Taxi.

237
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,240
Is this the watch? Is it?

238
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,240
What?

239
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,040
That's right.

240
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
It's me.

241
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,360
You have the right to remain silent...

242
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,720
Cut it out.

243
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,800
You have the right to an attorney...

244
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,760
Hey. Do you know why Clara...

245
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,840
sent Kim Sun Young for the sexual favor?

246
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,400
It's because I threatened her that I would ruin your life,

247
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,080
her officer boyfriend, if she wouldn't.

248
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,520
She did it without thinking to protect you.

249
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,840
It's all because of you, you idiot.

250
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
You punk...

251
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,280
So you're saying that he killed Crazy Dog too?

252
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,080
I found this under Kim Young Seok's desk.

253
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,160
I think Gwang Gyun dropped it while searching his office.

254
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,160
He's right. It's Gwang Gyun's.

255
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,080
From the angle of the brush and the sanitary condition,

256
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,800
I can definitely tell it's his.

257
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,400
I knew it.

258
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,480
I know Gwang Gyun does crazy things,

259
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,720
but he would never drive drunk, Captain Bong.

260
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,840
You're right. He would never do that.

261
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
Gosh, if I had known he'd die in vain like this,

262
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,720
I would've bought him a new toothbrush. My dear Gwang Gyun.

263
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,680
Gwang Gyun.

264
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,120
Don't worry.

265
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,280
I bought him a box of new toothbrushes.

266
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,000
I bought 1,000 of them, so it'd be enough.

267
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,880
That crazy jerk at the funeral was you?

268
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,600
- Let's go. - You...

269
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,360
Let's go arrest him. We should catch him ourselves.

270
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,040
Calm down, So Tae.

271
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,800
We can't arrest him without proof.

272
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,880
He's right.

273
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,040
We're dealing with a presidential candidate, who has lots of support.

274
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,320
We'll get in trouble if we move hastily without proof.

275
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,600
He even falsely accused the head of Royeol and sent him to jail.

276
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,600
Darn it. Everything would be over if we had that tape.

277
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
We must find that tape.

278
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,600
Hey. How can we find it?

279
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,360
Moo Gang is the only one who knows where it is,

280
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,920
but he lost all his memories.

281
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,600
Moo Gang.

282
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,640
Can you please do something to remember it?

283
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,120
There's no hope for that.

284
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,160
There is only one way.

285
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,200
This guy.

286
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,280
Before you lost your memories,

287
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,080
you went around looking for the tape with him.

288
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,920
It's likely that he knows where the tape is.

289
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,440
I barely managed to find him,

290
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,760
but I lost him because they got there first.

291
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,560
I don't know if they've captured him already,

292
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,440
but he would be in hiding if they didn't.

293
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,280
Unless my memories return,

294
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,040
this guy named Lee Byeong Tae is the only way we can find the tape.

295
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,960
Okay. Let's find him then. Okay?

296
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,960
Where those who died during the Moojin Time Mart incident are,

297
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,440
because I'm determined to reveal the truth...

298
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,720
What a shameless jerk.

299
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,240
A murderer who killed my dad wants to be the president?

300
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,680
By the way, Moo Gang...

301
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,120
Has he found the tape or not? This is driving me crazy.

302
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Okay.

303
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,240
I should just find that child fortune-teller myself.

304
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,320
That pub owner might know where she is.

305
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,160
What's the problem?

306
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,480
This wreck.

307
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,280
Why is he suddenly treating me so coldly?

308
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,800
I wonder what they were investigating there.

309
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,920
(My son did not suffer from depression.)

310
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,000
What? Mr. Oh?

311
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,200
(My son did not suffer from depression.)

312
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
She was Mr. Oh's mother.

313
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,080
I checked with the police in Los Angeles.

314
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,560
Lee Jung Bae wasn't killed in a simple car accident either,

315
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,720
but he drove drunk as well, okay?

316
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,800
Lee Byeong Tae, who was eight years old back then, was at the scene too.

317
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,520
When he woke up at the hospital,

318
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,320
he told the police that his dad didn't drink alcohol.

319
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,880
But since he was just a little boy,

320
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,760
people didn't pay attention to him.

321
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,920
Lee Byeong Tae grew up and must've realized...

322
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,280
that something was suspicious about his dad's death.

323
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,920
He probably started investigating it on his own,

324
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,520
met Moo Gang investigating his own brother's death,

325
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
and joined in the investigation.

326
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,520
If they investigated it together, they must've contacted each other.

327
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,960
Why isn't Lee Byeong Tae's number on Moo Gang's call log?

328
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,920
Gosh. He must've used a burner phone.

329
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,680
Look how he completely fooled us until now.

330
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,760
You sly punk.

331
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,280
What?

332
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,800
Were there any other phones in your house?

333
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,720
- I'm not sure. - I shouldn't expect you to know.

334
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,280
Hey, search his house.

335
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,360
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

336
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,920
You punk.

337
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,720
Why is its head so big? It's as big as So Tae's head.

338
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,520
My head is as big as this?

339
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,520
- Am I wrong? - That's ridiculous.

340
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,920
I'm sorry. The owner isn't here right now.

341
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,480
Goodbye.

342
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,720
(Yoon Soo Wan)

343
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,320
(You can do it!)

344
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,120
They're not going to suspect you now.

345
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,160
I'll find Lee Byeong Tae and arrest Kim Young Seok myself,

346
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,360
so stay out of this.

347
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,320
Hello?

348
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,360
I'm the waitress at Moojin Pub.

349
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,160
It's about the guy, who left the medicine, you asked me about.

350
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,960
He was just here now.

351
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,000
What?

352
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,440
Seriously. Why is she always out every time I go there?

353
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,720
She said it's a real estate agency across Moojin Elementary School.

354
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,440
What's wrong with this wreck again?

355
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,760
(Nuel Auto Repair Shop)

356
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,240
You should wait 3 to 4 hours for the parts to arrive.

357
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,400
Will it take that long?

358
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,480
Yes.

359
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,160
Have you lived here, in Moojin, for a long time by any chance?

360
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,320
Oh, yes. I've been living here since I was born.

361
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,400
Do you know the child fortune-teller who was famous here before then?

362
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,720
A child fortune-teller?

363
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Yes, I heard she usually wore sunglasses.

364
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,240
Oh, that detective's daughter?

365
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,360
Do you know her?

366
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,880
Of course. She's the one who left me this scar.

367
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,000
What?

368
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,440
So Yoon Soo Wan said Lee Byeong Tae came to the Pub in Moojin?

369
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,680
Let's hurry.

370
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,280
I'll meet you there.

371
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,720
What are you talking about?

372
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,560
We should hurry before we lose him.

373
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,680
It'll be much faster if I go alone.

374
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,440
Are you going to teleport or something?

375
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,200
What? That's...

376
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,440
Don't be ridiculous.

377
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,920
If not, driving with a siren on is the fastest way.

378
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,560
- Stop the nonsense, and get on. - We must hurry.

379
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Let's go.

380
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,240
Detective Kang's daughter? We don't know either.

381
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,320
We only heard that she moved to Seoul with her mom.

382
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,600
Seoul?

383
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,520
Where in Seoul would she be?

384
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,840
Darn it. I'm getting tailed.

385
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,760
What on earth? Who drives like that?

386
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,520
Darn it. What's the matter with them?

387
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Turn around. We should ticket them.

388
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,560
- Shall I really turn around? - Go ahead.

389
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,040
Captain Bong, are you okay?

390
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,080
We're here.

391
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,080
- Gui Nam and I will go in first. - Okay.

392
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,960
What? I came here with Gwang Gyun before...

393
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,200
to find the hostess of...

394
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,120
- Pumpkin Singer. - Is that so?

395
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,800
Then Moo Gang and Lee Byeong Tae must've come here...

396
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,000
to ask about that hostess as well.

397
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,440
But why did Lee Byeong Tae come here again now?

398
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,560
There they come.

399
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,000
What did they say?

400
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
I showed them his picture. It's certainly him.

401
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,800
He came to look for the owner...

402
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,960
and went to a real estate agency to find her.

403
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,840
- Come on. Let's move. - A real estate agency?

404
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,400
Let's hurry.

405
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,000
But why did he go to a real estate agency?

406
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
What are you doing? Get in.

407
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,600
He came to see the pub's owner,

408
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,000
but he didn't see the owner yet. Where did he go?

409
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,320
What should we do now?

410
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,160
It's like searching for a needle in a haystack.

411
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

412
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,600
We're looking for Lee Byeong Tae, not a needle.

413
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,360
My goodness, that idiot.

414
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,280
Moo Gang. I think getting your memory back is the fastest way.

415
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,520
What?

416
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
I can't get my memory back.

417
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,400
It's not an option.

418
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,400
You brat.

419
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,480
We should help him get it back then.

420
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,400
What do you mean?

421
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,640
Is your memory back?

422
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,280
My goodness. What are you doing?

423
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,800
- It failed. - Let's go.

424
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,400
Then please focus, and look at the watch.

425
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,000
- Look at it. - Focus.

426
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,720
Red sun.

427
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,200
How long do I have to keep looking at it? It's been an hour.

428
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,160
I feel like peeing right now.

429
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,200
All right, let's try again. Focus.

430
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,720
Red sun!

431
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
I wet my pants.

432
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,840
Keep looking at it.

433
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,760
Red sun!

434
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,080
My gosh. Darn it.

435
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,960
I feel better now.

436
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Hey.

437
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,440
Hey, he needs a greater shock.

438
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,000
Stick his head in the toilet.

439
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,400
- What are you doing? - Moo Gang, I'm sorry.

440
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
- I'm sorry. - What...

441
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,400
I'm sorry. Sorry.

442
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,800
- Sorry. - Hang in there.

443
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,880
Do you think his memory returned?

444
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,240
Yes. In TV dramas,

445
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,680
this is when people regain their memories.

446
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,680
Hey, Moo Gang.

447
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,200
He's awake.

448
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,560
Moo Gang. Can you hear me?

449
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,200
Do you know who I am?

450
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,280
Look at his eyes.

451
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,800
Those are the eyes of the old, naive Han Moo Gang.

452
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,520
- He's back. - I think so too.

453
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,600
Moo Gang.

454
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,960
Who am I?

455
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
Tell me.

456
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,440
Who am I?

457
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,920
Short-legged Grandpa.

458
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,240
- Gosh. - Darn it.

459
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,280
- You silly humans... - Gosh.

460
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,520
Who said we should have tried that?

461
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,800
My goodness.

462
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
Gosh, what a temper.

463
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,200
Darn it. Nothing worked.

464
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,440
Captain Bong, you took it too far.

465
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
You almost killed him.

466
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,760
You're taking revenge for being called Short-legged Grandpa, right?

467
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,360
You brat.

468
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,280
Then what should we do now?

469
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,880
We know who the culprit is, but we can't arrest him...

470
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,720
because we don't have crucial evidence.

471
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,320
This isn't working. Let's give his brain an electric shock next time.

472
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,320
My gosh.

473
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,640
Those foolish humans.

474
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,520
Are they trying to kill me or what?

475
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,159
Han Moo Gang.

476
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,120
That's right.

477
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,920
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

478
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,360
Gosh, the hero is always a prosecutor.

479
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,280
007, bring Han Moo Gang here now.

480
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,400
Go, and bring me his soul. Now.

481
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,719
Why do you need his soul all of a sudden?

482
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,000
The tape. He knows everything.

483
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
He knows where it is. Bring him here now. That's it.

484
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,040
- Okay. - All right.

485
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,480
He became the mayor of Moojin.

486
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,840
He said he'd reveal the truth about the Moojin Time Mart incident,

487
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,720
so people made him their mayor,

488
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,160
but he hasn't revealed anything.

489
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,200
The government needs to be changed now.

490
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,440
Could you tell us about the protest in front of your office...

491
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,920
which has been happening for a year?

492
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,560
Let me be clear.

493
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,440
I didn't raise my son that poorly.

494
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,280
I believe what my son told me.

495
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,800
I don't know who paid that lady or how much they paid her...

496
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,960
to make me lose the election,

497
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,640
but please stop selling your child for money.

498
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,360
What? "Selling your child"?

499
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,320
- Aren't you ashamed? - Someone like him...

500
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,120
shouldn't become the president.

501
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,480
No.

502
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,760
A lot of people ended up dying because I saved Wang Young Choon.

503
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,160
Let's just mind my own business.

504
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,240
(Seoun Police Station)

505
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,600
- Hey, I'm here. - Hello.

506
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,360
- Hello. - Hey.

507
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,880
- Good morning. - Hello.

508
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,160
- What... - What? Moo Gang!

509
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,680
Hello, sir.

510
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,920
Hey, did you regain your memory?

511
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,400
Pardon?

512
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,720
- Captain Bong, it must've worked. - I guess so.

513
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,200
But why is Detective Na's desk empty?

514
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,720
Did he get transferred to another team? Did he?

515
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,960
Oh, did he get promoted?

516
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,680
What? What's going on?

517
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,800
I think he lost all his memory from after the accident this time.

518
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,360
My gosh.

519
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,680
Hello, sir.

520
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,520
Hey.

521
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,320
Anyway, I'm glad he got his memory back.

522
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,720
- Don't you think so? - Me too,

523
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,280
but I'm a little taken aback.

524
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,280
Great shot, sir.

525
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,320
My goodness.

526
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,080
I'm a candidate for the presidential election now,

527
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,320
but I'm running short on funds.

528
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,480
Of course. Then allow me to help you out.

529
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,440
My gosh, thank you.

530
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,520
- Congressman Kim. - Yes.

531
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,920
- Excuse me. - Okay.

532
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,560
I think Moo Gang regained his memory.

533
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,440
Call Chen, and tell him to keep his eyes on Han Moo Gang.

534
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,840
I'll trust that you'll help. I should get going now.

535
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Okay. Please go back safely.

536
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
- Okay. Thank you. - No problem.

537
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,960
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

538
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,280
That scumbag.

539
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,200
Hello.

540
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,560
Hey, Detective Han.

541
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,440
My gosh, he's changed.

542
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,800
Hey, Byeong Tae.

543
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,560
Yes, my memory's back.

544
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,080
I found the videotape. I'm on my way to get it.

545
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,080
Yes. I'll call you once I find it. Okay then.

546
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,960
Moo Gang just found the videotape.

547
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,160
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

548
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,280
Who are you?

549
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,480
Long time no see, Sun Young.

550
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,200
I kept you alive because you said you'll find that videotape.

551
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,320
But you dare to stab me in the back?

552
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,600
(My darling Soo Wan)

553
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,840
Soo Wan.

554
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,080
What are you trying to do right now?

555
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,120
Moo Gang, I heard you got your memory back.

556
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,280
You jerk.

557
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,640
You better bring me the videotape if you don't want her to die.

558
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,160
She has nothing to do with me.

559
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,440
Really?

560
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,640
Then is it okay if I kill her right now?

561
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,640
Okay. I'll go meet you right now.

562
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,760
Let's meet now.

563
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,440
Kim Sun Young.

564
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm sorry, Moo Gang.

565
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,960
How can you do this, Captain Lee?

566
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,240
I'm very competent and ambitious unlike your boss, Captain Bong.

567
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,440
I have a really big dream.

568
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,600
What?

569
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,800
Did he promise that he'll make you the chief if he becomes president?

570
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,880
- Come here. - Moo Gang.

571
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,200
There.

572
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,000
I showed you Soo Wan, so it's time for you to show me what's mine.

573
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,560
Where's the videotape?

574
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,080
Let's check if it's real or not.

575
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,520
I can't believe it really existed.

576
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,160
I thought Clara was lying to me.

577
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,400
Give me the videotape,

578
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,240
and take her in return.

579
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,800
But you're really incredible.

580
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,560
Where did you find that videotape?

581
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,560
You never intended on broadcasting the interview in the first place.

582
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,120
You just used her pain...

583
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,040
for your successful career.

584
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,680
You were also behind...

585
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,560
faking Woo Byung Sik's death.

586
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,880
That helped you earn their trust.

587
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,640
Then you each got those expensive watches...

588
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,040
as a symbol of your trust and loyalty for each other.

589
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
Right?

590
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,120
You were probably on cloud nine back then...

591
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,200
just until you got a phone call.

592
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,240
It's been four days since...

593
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,280
the collapse of Moojin Time Mart.

594
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,240
Almost 300 people have been confirmed...

595
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,840
- to have died already. - A 300,000-dollar watch.

596
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,520
Hello, this is Director Kim of...

597
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,160
Give me the original videotape of Sun Young's interview.

598
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,720
If you don't, I'm going to reveal the videotape of you raping her.

599
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,280
What? Who... Who are you?

600
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,040
What are you talking about?

601
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,320
You fool.

602
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,480
Everything got recorded because you forgot to turn off the camera.

603
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,320
- What? - I have nothing to lose.

604
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,720
If that interview gets revealed, my man's career is going to end.

605
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,600
Do you think I'll go down alone?

606
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,600
I'm going to show the world that you're a rapist.

607
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,000
Wait. Let's... Let's...

608
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,160
Let's meet first.

609
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,400
Where are you?

610
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,160
Okay.

611
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,680
What?

612
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,240
I... I thought I had turned it off. Why did that get recorded?

613
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,240
(Report on the Inspection of Victim Kim Na Kyung)

614
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,560
(Conclusion: The police thought it was a fire accident at first.)

615
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,960
Hello, Mr. Oh Chun Su.

616
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,440
Do you know a guy named Wang Young Choon...

617
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,560
who's getting investigated for insurance fraud?

618
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,880
The NISI did a secondary inspection on your wife's corpse,

619
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,560
and they found a choking mark on her neck.

620
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,040
If this goes public, you're going to get doomed.

621
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,120
You'll have to rot in prison for the rest of your life.

622
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,720
I didn't kill my wife.

623
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,520
She died because of a fire.

624
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
- I won't broadcast any of this. - What?

625
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,680
I'll get rid of all the evidence for you.

626
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,920
And I'll let you get a million dollars for her insurance.

627
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,680
(Confirmation of Insurance Payment)

628
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,480
(Name: Kim Na Kyung, Receiver: Wang Young Choon)

629
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,840
What do you want?

630
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,280
I want you to find a videotape for me.

631
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,040
You also need to shut someone up.

632
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,880
You managed to use Wang Young Choon to kill Clara.

633
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,080
But you failed to find the videotape.

634
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,240
So you wondered what you should do with Wang Young Choon.

635
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,200
Then you decided to lock him up at a mental hospital.

636
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,400
You schemed with his sister-in-law and that hospital director.

637
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,560
I wasn't initially planning on locking him up.

638
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,560
I was going to kill him.

639
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,560
But he kept annoying me by telling me that he has the tape...

640
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,640
and that I should give him his insurance money first.

641
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,520
So I wanted to be sure.

642
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,720
And for 20 years while he was locked up in the hospital,

643
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,040
the videotape was nowhere to be found.

644
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,760
So I thought Wang Young Choon was really hiding that videotape.

645
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,640
He almost had me fooled.

646
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,600
I let him stay alive.

647
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,080
But he escaped from the hospital, killed Mi So,

648
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,440
and he even tried to kill my son, Leo.

649
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,440
He also dared to burn me alive.

650
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,920
I'll be with the kids over there.

651
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,000
So start a fire when the time is right.

652
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,680
Then I'll pretend to save a few kids.

653
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,320
The stupid people of this country will start to treat me like a hero.

654
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,960
It's your turn now.

655
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,120
- Let's go now. - You must be having fun.

656
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,320
- My goodness. - Yes.

657
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,480
(Tell us why you killed them! Who allowed you to build the mart?)

658
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,040
Sir, what's that?

659
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,240
What?

660
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
What?

661
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,080
Where's Kim Young Seok? Where is he?

662
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,680
Where did he go?

663
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,120
- You little... - Just die, you jerk!

664
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,800
You crazy jerk.

665
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,840
Let's say you suffocated to death here, shall we?

666
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,080
So that's why you ordered Captain Lee to shoot him.

667
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,920
Of course.

668
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,480
I would've gotten ruined if he got caught and told everyone the truth.

669
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,040
You used Oh Chun Su's paper company to gather money for 20 years...

670
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,720
to enter politics.

671
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,720
Then you used the Moojin Time Mart incident to gain trust...

672
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,680
so that you could prepare yourself...

673
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,600
to become the president of Korea one day. You must've been happy.

674
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,040
And that only lasted until you got another phone call.

675
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,120
Where's the million dollars?

676
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,480
Give me the videotape first.

677
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,240
Call me when you have my money.

678
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,120
Check if she has the videotape, and take care of her afterward.

679
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,840
So you used that guy with no middle finger to kill Han Jin Sook.

680
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,320
Then you put her corpse into the freezer to send out a message.

681
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,840
"If you act up, I'm going to kill you."

682
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,480
Yes, that's right.

683
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,840
I warned Sun Young to keep her mouth shut.

684
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,320
I think Man Ho...

685
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,440
caused trouble because of something regarding his father.

686
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,760
And when Chief Song recognized Han Jin Sook,

687
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,200
he went to see you because he was suspicious of Oh Man Ho.

688
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,280
But he probably found out about your secret.

689
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,800
Man Ho killed someone...

690
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,760
because of his dad?

691
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,080
I shouldn't have ignored what had happened back then.

692
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,400
I was too greedy.

693
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,680
What... What are you going to do then?

694
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,960
Are you going to reveal everything?

695
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,280
I should...

696
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,240
make things right again before it gets too late.

697
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,840
It seemed like he was headed to meet Detective Na right away.

698
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,760
But if things got out, it would've been really bad for me.

699
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,680
So I had no choice but to get rid of him.

700
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,600
Then you probably thought everything was over...

701
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,800
until Seung Chul's dad told you that Woo Byung Sik was still alive.

702
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,280
Congressman Kim.

703
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,720
- Congressman Kim. - Yes?

704
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,160
My wife... My wife found Woo Byung Sik.

705
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,720
Really?

706
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,600
He probably told you about his plan...

707
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,960
after having kidnapped Woo Byung Sik's son.

708
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,120
But once his plan got ruined,

709
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,680
he found out that you were the bad guy all along.

710
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,320
You little jerk.

711
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,080
You were behind all this?

712
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,840
You probably thought it'd become a perfect crime...

713
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,840
if you made Mr. Park seem mentally ill.

714
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,160
But then you were faced with a variable.

715
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,240
Photos of Woo Byung Sik is falling from the sky.

716
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,960
It turns out that Woo Byung Sik's photos were actually real.

717
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,760
Therefore, it has been confirmed that he is still alive.

718
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,200
- He is now a wanted criminal. - If Woo Byung Sik ever shows up,

719
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,880
- He's also wanted by Interpol. - kill him.

720
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,160
They are doing their best to catch him.

721
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,880
You had to kill Woo Byung Sik because his photos became public.

722
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,960
Because if people find out that he's still alive,

723
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,960
your whole life would end up getting ruined.

724
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,120
He was such a great friend. Even I...

725
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,240
didn't want to kill him.

726
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,160
You were going to blame him for Han Jin Sook's death,

727
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,360
but there were photos of him on the exact date of her death.

728
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,320
That's why you ended up framing Oh Man Ho...

729
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,640
for every murder that you had committed.

730
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,800
But when Oh Chun Su found out about everything,

731
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,320
he tried to reveal that it was you by revealing the interview tape.

732
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,360
How far are you planning to go?

733
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,200
How many more people are you going to kill?

734
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,440
I want you to stop now.

735
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,280
If you don't,

736
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,600
I'm not going to stand still.

737
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,680
What's this senile old man planning to do?

738
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,960
By killing him, you would've been able to keep everything a secret.

739
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,600
And all the money in his paper company would've become yours.

740
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,280
That's why you killed Oh Chun Su!

741
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,720
And lastly,

742
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,360
you killed Detective Na because he found out about all this.

743
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,880
You're very impressive, Moo Gang.

744
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,800
When did you investigate all this?

745
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,200
You really should've died that day when you got shot.

746
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,280
Yes. Everything you just said is all correct.

747
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,960
I killed everyone, and I framed Oh Man Ho for every single crime.

748
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,080
But what are you going to do now? Everything's over, okay?

749
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,680
But I'm really curious.

750
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,800
Where did you find this? Did your dead brother give it to you?

751
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,960
Your brother didn't have it with him when I last saw him.

752
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,760
Darn it.

753
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,760
Where was it?

754
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,840
Why did you kill him?

755
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,000
You didn't have to kill my brother!

756
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,280
Know your facts before attacking me, you jerk. Okay?

757
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,640
Your brother was already dead when I had arrived.

758
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,440
Your brother was getting chased by Wang Young Choon,

759
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,840
and he died because he got hit by a car while running away!

760
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,800
You jerk.

761
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,240
Don't lie to me.

762
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,120
Why don't you ask Kang Soo Hyuk?

763
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,480
He was obsessed with finding the murderer of your brother.

764
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,480
Is that why you killed Kang Soo Hyuk?

765
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,880
Were you scared he might find out that it was you?

766
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,800
Is that why you ordered Wang Young Choon to kill him?

767
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,720
Why did you kill my brother? Why?

768
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,120
Shut it, you jerk.

769
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,320
You punk.

770
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,440
I'm going to become the president soon.

771
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,320
How dare you try to get in my way?

772
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,880
Do you know how hard it was for me to get here?

773
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,720
How dare you try to disturb me from getting what I want?

774
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,080
You should've died when you got shot that day.

775
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,040
My gosh!

776
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,920
This good-for-nothing jerk.

777
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,480
My gosh.

778
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,840
Hey.

779
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,880
Come here, and get rid of this punk.

780
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,960
Bury him with that wench, would you?

781
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,200
This jerk.

782
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,240
What?

783
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,760
What... What is this?

784
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,640
Film him well.

785
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,720
Okay.

786
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,120
Are you recording him?

787
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,720
I'm recording everything.

788
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,640
That's a fake.

789
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,240
That's not edible, okay?

790
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,000
Humans always munch on the weirdest things.

791
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,280
What a weird appetite.

792
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,800
What... What's this?

793
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,360
Everyone in this country just watched you live.

794
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,880
Seung Chul's dad taught me a few moves.

795
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,720
I didn't know that I'd ever use this method.

796
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,320
- Goodness, how could he? - I know, right?

797
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,160
- What is this? - Goodness.

798
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,480
This can't be true.

799
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,000
Then did he kill all those people?

800
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,000
How dare you kill Gwang Gyun?

801
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,280
Calm down, Captain Bong. The camera is filming this.

802
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,080
How dare you, a mere human.

803
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,840
What... What is it?

804
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,600
Hey, stop recording now.

805
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,280
You idiot.

806
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,560
I'll be adjusting the screen for a second.

807
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,560
- Turn it off now. - Hold on.

808
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
- Did you turn it off? - Yes.

809
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,240
This is for Yoon Soo Wan.

810
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,440
This is for Seung Chul's family.

811
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,640
This is for Ha Ram's father.

812
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,200
Goodness, this feels really good.

813
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,920
And this...

814
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,200
is for Kim Joon.

815
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,960
And this...

816
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,040
is for the poor children...

817
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,080
and those poor people who died...

818
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,720
because of your wicked deeds, you jerk.

819
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,360
Goodness, Han Moo Gang.

820
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,160
You're like the actor of the year from the Academy Awards.

821
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,480
You said you don't remember much but you surely do.

822
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,960
You're the best.

823
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,080
The actor of the year is him, the Short-legged Grandpa, not me.

824
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,320
You have the right to remain silent.

825
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,640
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

826
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,840
You have the right to an attorney.

827
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,120
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.

828
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,280
Come here, you scumbag.

829
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,240
007, bring Han Moo Gang here now.

830
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,040
Go, and bring me his soul. Now.

831
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,360
Why do you need his soul all of a sudden?

832
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,880
The tape. He knows everything.

833
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,280
He knows where it is. Bring him here now.

834
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,320
- That's it. - All right.

835
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,560
He's gone.

836
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,200
What?

837
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,400
He's gone? Where?

838
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,280
I sent him to paradise.

839
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,440
Sent him?

840
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,320
Send him where? What are you talking about?

841
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,800
I really don't know about this.

842
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,280
Don't worry.

843
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,400
Nobody saw me sending him.

844
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,200
Nobody is bothering for Han Moo Gang's soul anymore.

845
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,000
You won't have any trouble using his body now.

846
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,840
That's not what I mean! I need him now!

847
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,440
I need Han Moo Gang right now!

848
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,080
What, you selfish jerk?

849
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,040
Until when do you want to keep his soul? Don't you feel bad?

850
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,240
His soul has the right to rest in peace.

851
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,920
Didn't he say anything about the tape when he left?

852
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,000
No, no, no! He kept his mouth shut and left quietly.

853
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,680
He kept quiet and left?

854
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,400
Why didn't you tell me?

855
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,840
Wait a second.

856
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,720
Right.

857
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,320
Right.

858
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,320
I know how to get Kim Young Seok even without the tape.

859
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,560
That's right.

860
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,720
That's right.

861
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,520
Let's get inside.

862
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,920
See if anybody's watching us.

863
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,000
Goodness.

864
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
What?

865
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,400
Han Moo Gang.

866
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,240
What is it, Short-legged Grandpa?

867
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,440
He's still the same.

868
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,160
It's hard for me to wear this childish outfit.

869
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,560
- Hey, assemble these. - Yes, sir.

870
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,440
What are you doing with that?

871
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,600
Stay still.

872
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,160
I know what to do.

873
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,280
So you plan to trick him and make him think you regained your memory?

874
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,960
That's right.

875
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,280
Hey, will he fall for that?

876
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,160
Kim Young Seok isn't a fool. He'd want to see the tape himself.

877
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,720
I'll help.

878
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,240
Have you made up your mind?

879
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,760
If you do as I say, you might get hurt.

880
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,360
No.

881
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,640
He didn't hit me from there.

882
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,160
- Then how? - Hey! Hit me softly! It hurts!

883
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,040
Are you kidding me? We have to make it realistic.

884
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,240
But why do I have to play this role?

885
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,840
Are you kidding me?

886
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,960
Look at this.

887
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,560
This isn't a girl's leg.

888
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,400
What about his?

889
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,320
My calves are thick.

890
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,880
They won't work.

891
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,000
- Then what about him? - Detective Park, did you bring it?

892
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,080
- It's here. - Let me see.

893
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,160
What?

894
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,600
- Hey, hold him. - What are you all doing?

895
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,200
- Hold him! - No, don't!

896
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,360
- You should do the inner side. - Stop it. Don't do it!

897
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,640
Don't do this!

898
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,640
Hold on.

899
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
It's almost over.

900
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,080
Once more.

901
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,080
- Only two times more. - No!

902
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,280
I'll kill you all!

903
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,880
- Hold it there. - Don't do it!

904
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,080
Cut! Stop.

905
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,560
We're filming a 20-year-old tape. The resolution will be low.

906
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,960
Relax your bodies.

907
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,160
Haven't you hit anybody before?

908
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,640
We can stop if it's hard for you.

909
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,960
No, I have to do this.

910
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,600
I'm the only one who knows about it.

911
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,160
- It's fine if you get slapped. - This is too much.

912
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,240
- Just act like you slap. - Okay. Let's do it again.

913
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,720
Okay.

914
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,080
The lighting is done.

915
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,880
If we press this button, the recordings will go live.

916
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,400
Here.

917
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,120
The tape is in the pawnshop. Are we all set then?

918
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,280
Yes, sir.

919
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,920
But how did you come up with such an idea?

920
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,200
Seung Chul's father.

921
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,120
He failed back then.

922
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,160
But it will work this time.

923
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,040
Good job, everybody.

924
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,880
You too, sir. Good luck.

925
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,960
Quiet, everyone.

926
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,720
Hey, I haven't peed for five hours.

927
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,320
My hand didn't shake even once while holding the camera either.

928
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,320
I think it's shaking.

929
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,800
Gwang Gyun, are you watching us?

930
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,840
We finally made it.

931
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,120
My team isn't full of flaws.

932
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,480
They're the best police in Korea.

933
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,000
But where are you looking at?

934
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,440
We're not full of flaws.

935
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,440
Are you okay?

936
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,680
Yes.

937
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,360
By the way,

938
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,720
where is the real tape?

939
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,640
(Kim Yeong Seok confessed his crimes while on a live broadcast.)

940
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,760
That stupid jerk.

941
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,160
I shouldn't have helped.

942
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,960
(Truth Commission for Moojin Time Mart)

943
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,680
Hey, find the butterfly watch.

944
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,160
You can't go home unless we find that, okay?

945
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,320
- Yes, sir. - Hurry now.

946
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,720
- Search over there. - Yes, sir.

947
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,280
Moo Gang.

948
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,840
Are you happy with Ha Ram?

949
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,160
Where are you going?

950
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,280
I have a friend in Chicago.

951
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,520
I'll go there and work in the same hospital.

952
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,200
- Really? - Yes.

953
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,480
Anyway.

954
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,040
About Oh Chun Su's interview tape.

955
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,400
Yes.

956
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,000
It seemed like it had been edited.

957
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,280
It was edited?

958
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,360
Yes.

959
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,640
The water inside the cup had suddenly reduced.

960
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,760
Oh, that.

961
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,280
I was nervous.

962
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,920
So I ended up spilling some water on the floor.

963
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,040
As I became flustered and got up, my face got caught on the camera.

964
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,960
He must've edited that part.

965
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,000
I see.

966
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,240
Go inside.

967
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,960
Okay.

968
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,760
Yes.

969
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,640
It's all over now. Nothing will happen anymore.

970
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,040
They'll leave Moo Gang alone now.

971
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,040
So where's the videotape that proves that I'm a rapist?

972
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:15,000
Did you arrest me without having any clear evidence?

973
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,720
Bring me the evidence.

974
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,000
What a great congressman.

975
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,720
But where do you think he hid the watch?

976
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,720
We need that to prove that he's guilty.

977
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,880
He must've thrown it away.

978
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,400
But he already confessed everything.

979
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,840
Don't you think that will be enough?

980
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,840
Have you heard anything about the guy with no middle finger?

981
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,040
No. He gets paid to kill people.

982
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,600
He probably went abroad and went into hiding already.

983
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,520
My gosh.

984
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,120
- My goodness. No. - Wait. Stop.

985
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,360
- Where is he? - Stop.

986
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,040
Are you human? How do you even call yourself human?

987
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,520
You were brazen enough to answer my questions about my dad.

988
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,920
You're not even a human being.

989
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,240
Did you just smile? Did you just smile?

990
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,520
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

991
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,280
That's enough.

992
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,280
This is making me feel upset.

993
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,400
I didn't kill her dad.

994
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,160
Are you smiling?

995
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,480
Are you smiling right now?

996
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,160
I might as well just rip your lips apart.

997
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,640
Take him to the holding cell.

998
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,720
Yes, sir.

999
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,720
- Hey, come here. - Get up.

1000
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,480
My gosh.

1001
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,600
Kim Young Seok.

1002
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,520
You worthless jerk!

1003
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,600
How dare you kill my dad? Let me go!

1004
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,280
You... I'm going to kill you no matter what, okay?

1005
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,600
Did you hear me? You better watch out.

1006
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,200
- I'm going to kill you! - Let's go.

1007
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,400
How's he going to deal with what he just did to me?

1008
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,600
Hey, you should rather be worried about yourself.

1009
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,600
Let's go get you locked up.

1010
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,800
It's all over now, Ha Ram.

1011
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,040
They said that my dad...

1012
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:29,399
died while he was trying to catch the culprit who killed Joon.

1013
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,399
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you.

1014
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,040
I didn't know you were trying to catch Kim Young Seok.

1015
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,800
I thought you were angry at me.

1016
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,800
I thought you were being coldhearted because you were mad at me.

1017
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,840
Thank you.

1018
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,840
Thank you for finding the culprit who killed my dad and Joon.

1019
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,640
I hope you make Kim Young Seok rot in prison forever.

1020
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,080
Let's go. I'll take you home.

1021
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,640
No, it's okay. I can go by myself. You must be busy.

1022
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,720
It's all over now.

1023
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,640
I can finally leave at ease now.

1024
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:53,399
They say Kim Young Seok...

1025
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,520
killed my dad.

1026
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,720
Yes.

1027
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,080
He killed my dad and Joon too.

1028
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,520
I can't believe he killed all those people.

1029
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,800
I thought my dad had killed your dad at first.

1030
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,760
I couldn't say anything to you.

1031
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,120
I just kept avoiding you because I felt sorry.

1032
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:18,120
However, I don't know what I should be doing now either.

1033
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,760
Although Kim Young Seok turned out to be the culprit,

1034
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,560
that doesn't mean my dad isn't responsible for what he did.

1035
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,800
I'm so sorry, Ha Ram.

1036
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:30,400
And Man Ho wasn't the one who sent people to check up on me.

1037
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,760
Kim Young Seok sent them because he thought Leo...

1038
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,760
was the one who beat up Tiffany.

1039
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,720
I never thought that Leo...

1040
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,400
would ever turn out to be his son.

1041
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,800
Me neither.

1042
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,480
I'm sorry that we couldn't stop your father from dying,

1043
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,440
but your mother still has a chance.

1044
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,040
That woman I had met in front of Congressman Nam's office...

1045
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,360
was your mother, wasn't she?

1046
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,400
It's going to be tomorrow. She will hang herself at home...

1047
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,640
at 3pm tomorrow.

1048
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,920
It has nothing to do with me.

1049
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,800
(My son did not suffer from depression.)

1050
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,680
What's that Grim Reaper doing over there?

1051
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,480
I don't know.

1052
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,920
What? It's him.

1053
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,680
(My son did not suffer from depression.)

1054
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,360
My goodness.

1055
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,840
Anyone who committed suicide isn't allowed to appear...

1056
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,280
before their family and friends.

1057
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,520
Hey, it's Ha Ram. Ha Ram!

1058
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,120
You punk.

1059
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,000
Stop acting like you're younger. You're a lot older than her.

1060
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,240
Ha Ram!

1061
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,480
Stop it.

1062
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,640
Thank you.

1063
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,880
Thank you for listening to me and trusting me.

1064
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,240
I heard you didn't even get to give your son a proper funeral.

1065
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,080
I can't give him a proper funeral before I reveal the truth...

1066
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,640
behind my son's death.

1067
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,640
I heard that you think your son committed suicide...

1068
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,840
because he got sexually molested.

1069
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,800
Do you have any evidence to prove that?

1070
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,120
An hour before he committed suicide,

1071
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,680
he called me while crying.

1072
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,280
I asked him what was wrong,

1073
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,840
and he kept saying,

1074
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,960
He kept saying, "Lieutenant Nam".

1075
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,840
Then he just kept crying.

1076
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,800
Then he suddenly hung up on me.

1077
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,440
I think Congressman Nam's son...

1078
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,440
did something to my son that day.

1079
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,160
Why does he keep following her?

1080
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,200
He can't leave because he knows that his mom's going to die soon.

1081
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,720
Then why did he commit suicide?

1082
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,040
He probably couldn't take it anymore.

1083
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,000
Nam Joo Seung, that jerk!

1084
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,400
But the army doctor, who found my son, told me...

1085
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,640
that he smelled menthol...

1086
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,560
around Kyung Soo's private parts.

1087
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,920
"Menthol"?

1088
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,160
I think he got...

1089
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,440
sexually molested with a pain-relieving liquid.

1090
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,280
And he got diagnosed with depression...

1091
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,440
even after that army doctor had made his statement?

1092
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,320
However, that army doctor went back on his testimony...

1093
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,120
during his second statement.

1094
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,240
What?

1095
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,160
And that army doctor also testified that...

1096
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,520
he saw Kyung Soo steal...

1097
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,840
some antidepressants from the clinic.

1098
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,160
That's why the army concluded that my son...

1099
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,920
had committed suicide because he was suffering from depression.

1100
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,920
Did you ever get a chance to talk to that army doctor?

1101
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,960
I kept asking him to confess the truth.

1102
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,360
But he keeps avoiding me.

1103
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,280
What?

1104
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,920
He accidentally mistook the smell of the pain-relief patch...

1105
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,400
that was on his hand at that time?

1106
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,280
What?

1107
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,960
Isn't this person...

1108
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,920
It's over now.

1109
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,520
All I have to do is leave.

1110
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,120
What are you doing?

1111
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,840
I must get rid of everything before leaving.

1112
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,000
Are you really leaving?

1113
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,600
By the way,

1114
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,800
have you found out why I can't leave this body?

1115
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,160
No.

1116
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,040
Those imbeciles.

1117
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,600
Call Death Squad tomorrow.

1118
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,520
Also,

1119
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,640
where did he go?

1120
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,000
What?

1121
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,480
Where did Moo Gang go?

1122
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:39,040
He became a detective to reveal the truth about his brother's death.

1123
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,640
He must have gone to paradise.

1124
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,880
The cut was quite deep, but it's gone.

1125
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,880
Joon was stabbed with a screwdriver on his right.

1126
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,800
He had a cut.

1127
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,400
It has only been a year. Why did it disappear?

1128
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,800
What? What is it?

1129
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I testified the truth.

1130
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,600
You testified that you smelled...

1131
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,520
menthol around Kyung Soo's private parts,

1132
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,200
but you changed your statement.

1133
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,760
You said it wasn't from Kyung Soo's dead body,

1134
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,520
but from a patch on your body.

1135
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,200
Yes, that's right.

1136
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,080
- Stop lying. - Pardon?

1137
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,640
You're allergic to menthol.

1138
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,920
This... This isn't coffee.

1139
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,960
I'm sorry.

1140
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,480
I must've confused it with peppermint tea.

1141
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,000
Gosh, I'm allergic to menthol.

1142
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,920
No... No, I'm not.

1143
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,440
I don't have such allergies.

1144
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,960
Really?

1145
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,720
Can you give me your hand?

1146
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,320
Why?

1147
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,000
Gosh, that hurts.

1148
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,800
Why did you make a false testimony?

1149
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,280
Let's talk at the police station.

1150
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,000
Congressman Nam and the CEO are best friends.

1151
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,360
I have to keep working here.

1152
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,480
He's already dead, but I must make a living.

1153
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,800
Can you please let it go?

1154
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,680
I can't do that, you brat.

1155
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,480
You call yourself a doctor?

1156
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,600
Wait right here, okay?

1157
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,400
Once he's tested for allergies,

1158
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,320
his false testimony will be revealed.

1159
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,600
And revealing the truth will set things right for his mother.

1160
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,080
Don't try to change people's fate.

1161
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,640
Otherwise, you'll face unbearable consequences.

1162
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,680
Don't forget what I said.

1163
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,440
Pardon me, sir.

1164
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,720
Excuse me, sir.

1165
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,560
What you told me last time.

1166
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,000
What did you mean by it?

1167
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,920
I have the same vision...

1168
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,000
as you.

1169
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,360
Does that mean you can also see...

1170
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,640
I can see the shadows.

1171
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,240
Then what you told me last time...

1172
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:38,440
Like you, I also worked hard to save people.

1173
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,280
However,

1174
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,200
during the flight accident...

1175
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:46,720
No, all of them will die!

1176
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,960
The cause of the accident...

1177
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,000
wasn't a mechanical error.

1178
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,400
Pardon me?

1179
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,920
What do you mean?

1180
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,640
Detective Han.

1181
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,160
Did Joon have a blue birthmark on his bottom?

1182
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,600
Do you mean the Mongolian mark?

1183
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,920
No, Joon didn't have it.

1184
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,200
Why do you ask?

1185
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,200
Really?

1186
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,680
Like you, I also worked hard to save people.

1187
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,360
However,

1188
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,160
the cause of the flight accident...

1189
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,920
wasn't a mechanical error.

1190
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:51,440
Pardon me? What do you mean?

1191
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,600
I saved someone from committing suicide because of his depression.

1192
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,000
He was the pilot in that airplane.

1193
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,000
He caused the accident to kill himself.

1194
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,800
Those who were on the flight...

1195
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,080
died because of me.

1196
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,080
When I saw the news,

1197
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,400
I stabbed my eyes. I couldn't bear what happened.

1198
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,680
Aren't you Joon?

1199
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,640
Then who are you?

1200
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,040
(Park Seung Chul)

1201
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:09,480
(Jang Hyun Soo)

1202
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,080
If Kim Young Seok killed Joon,

1203
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,240
he didn't have to change the body.

1204
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,240
Then who moved Joon's body?

1205
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,760
Why?

1206
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,480
Joon.

1207
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,040
Where are you?

1208
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,000
Is it possible...

1209
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,160
that you're alive?

1210
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,800
(Black)

1211
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,920
So are you saying that the culprit, who killed all these people,

1212
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,520
wasn't Oh Man Ho, but Kim Young Seok?

1213
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,800
It's likely that he knows where the tape is.

1214
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,640
I finally found him, but I lost him.

1215
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,480
Getting your memories back will be the fastest way possible.

1216
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,040
Are you upset with me?

1217
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,760
I'll get rid of everything and leave.

1218
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,240
Are you really leaving?

1219
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,320
Moo Gang, did you get your memories back?

1220
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,880
I found the tape. I'll go get it.

1221
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,520
You didn't have to kill my brother!

1222
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,960
Everything is over now, Ha Ram.
