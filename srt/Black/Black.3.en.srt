1
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,320
What kind of face shall I put on today?

2
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
I am formless.

3
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,440
I mean, it's obvious, isn't it?

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm not a human being.

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,960
However, I have to be in the human form...

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,200
on days that I go down to their realm to collect their souls.

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,320
It's because I have to make sure...

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,880
humans don't get scared and run away when they see us...

9
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,440
as that will only cause headaches for us.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,160
Hence, we always get in the human form...

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,480
which they'll find likeable...

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,760
when we go down there to get them.

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,720
Picking a face that will be perceived as likeable by humans...

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,400
is very tricky.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,160
My job is collecting humans' souls.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,440
Humans call us...

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,080
the Grim Reapers.

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,640
They should just come with us because they have to leave anyway.

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,120
Why do they have so much to talk about? Goodness.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,800
You cold-blooded, shameless woman.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,400
That's why you haven't been able to ascend to the upper world.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
Shut it, baldy.

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,640
You're in no position to talk.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
We, the Grim Reapers, are divided into two categories.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,160
The pure descents of the upper world who were born as the Grim Reapers.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,680
And...

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,160
these idiotic, pathetic ones who used to be humans.

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
You idiot! I told you to be careful.

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Do you know who he is?

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,160
They're here because they committed suicide.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,400
They took their own lives.

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,160
Working as the Grim Reapers is a punishment they must carry out.

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,000
The lives they gave up thoughtlessly can be so precious to other humans.

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,280
He wants them to learn the lesson on their own.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,280
Now, I'm on my way to collect a dead...

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,800
No, let me correct myself.

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm on my way...

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,000
to collect the soul of someone who is about to die.

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,240
(Black)

40
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,280
The ones who committed suicide still have their human bodies...

41
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,840
and memories intact.

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,600
That's why they get themselves in trouble at times while on duty.

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
For example, they let the soul which they have to collect run away,

44
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,440
or they hide in human bodies because they want to live again.

45
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,600
And that's why we say...

46
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,320
that partnering up with those ex-humans is the worst thing...

47
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,760
that can happen to us, the pure descents.

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,240
A month ago,

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,960
that man who killed himself,

50
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,400
the worst of the worst, was assigned to me as my partner.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,520
Yes, I'm a rap star, a hip-hop loving Grim Reaper

52
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,000
My mom told me, "Life is nothing special, Son"

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,600
Life never goes according to plan even after you die

54
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,960
Does he have that many regrets? Was he a devoted son?

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
What's that loser's tragic story?

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,480
He's bogging down our master

57
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,000
Loser, baby

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
Shut it.

59
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,520
By the way, how much of a loser is he, actually?

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,800
Don't even get me started.

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
When we went to collect an old lady's soul,

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,760
he hung out with her, saying that she reminds him of his grandmother.

63
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,000
When we had to collect a woman who died from an illness,

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,840
he hit on her, saying that she looks like his first love.

65
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
When we went to pick up a kid's soul,

66
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,520
he tried to let the soul flee, saying that he feels horrible.

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
That clueless loser is making my life so difficult.

68
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,040
My gosh!

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
You should just request to have your partner changed.

70
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,000
He's the most competent Grim Reaper...

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,880
in the whole universe.

72
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,320
444 will never make such a request.

73
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
He should know himself. He has way too much ego.

74
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,200
007, what are you talking about?

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,920
Don't you think you're being too disrespectful to him?

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,320
Be quiet, 416. How dare you.

77
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,240
I'm old enough to be your ancestor.

78
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,360
I was there when General Yi Sun Shin passed away.

79
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,520
Humans think that he died because he got hit by an arrow in his underarm.

80
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,760
That's not what happened.

81
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,080
I was there.

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,760
My mom told me

83
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,960
- That you're a total liar - Shut it!

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Why are you crazy about such ridiculous music?

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
Anyway, what are you going to do?

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,760
Working with that idiot will keep stressing you out.

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,000
This can't continue.

88
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,800
I need to sort this out.

89
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,840
What are you doing?

90
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,560
Let go!

91
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,400
Please let go of me!

92
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,880
Let go of me, and we'll talk!

93
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,520
Goodness.

94
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,120
Move.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
Get out of our way!

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,400
What? You want me to collect a soul by myself?

97
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,159
That's right. Open this capsule as soon as you arrive there.

98
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,880
The first thing you need to do is checking the face of the person.

99
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,400
We don't know when, where, and how the person will die.

100
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,640
The process begins when the form starts to disappear,

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,840
so watch him at all times and drag him here as soon as he dies. Got it?

102
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
I don't want to do it.

103
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,560
I can't do it alone.

104
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,200
Listen to me carefully.

105
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,400
If the soul runs away because you get distracted,

106
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,400
you'll never be able to ascend to the upper world.

107
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,760
Instead, you'll fall into the fiery pit.

108
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,600
Don't forget. From the second the form in the capsule disappears,

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,680
keep your eye on him at all times and bring him here.

110
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Go now.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,159
Go on!

112
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,640
He won't be able to do the job alone.

113
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,400
Of course not. If the soul runs away,

114
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,360
that loser will fall into the fiery pit.

115
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,560
Then I'll get a new partner.

116
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,760
What? Why is there another one?

117
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,200
444, 444!

118
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Look. I found another capsule.

119
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,960
"444". This is yours.

120
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,840
Didn't that loser take yours?

121
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,120
Gosh, it looks like those up there got confused and sent another one.

122
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,960
He must be going senile. I'm telling you.

123
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,360
Gosh, that old man.

124
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,280
He just can't let me take it easy.

125
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
Gosh, who's the human that didn't even lock the locker...

126
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,400
and make me come out of here?

127
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,880
- 444. - What's going on?

128
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
We have a big problem.

129
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,320
I went to the collection spot and found this.

130
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
- This is... - Isn't this the one the loser took?

131
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,600
He threw out this empty capsule. It means that he ran away, right?

132
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,920
If the Grim Reaper runs away in the human world...

133
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,160
It means that he's hiding in a dead human body somewhere.

134
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,120
Gosh, we must report this to the Death Squad now.

135
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,200
Hold on a second.

136
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,480
He may not have actually entered a body yet.

137
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,680
Let's try to find him first.

138
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,960
It was here. Hurry up!

139
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Here. It was right here.

140
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,560
I'll go this way and look for him. You go that way.

141
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,520
If you see any dead human, look around the body first. Got it?

142
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,800
Okay.

143
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,720
- Get moving already! - All right.

144
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,480
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,440
What if that idiot has gotten inside of someone's body already?

146
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,840
I've heard.

147
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,080
Have you not found him yet?

148
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,680
Gosh, stop it.

149
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,920
Just report it to the Death Squad now.

150
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,000
If they find out about this, it'll cause him trouble too.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,800
What? Why?

152
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,880
He will be punished as well for not properly managing his partner.

153
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
He will be punished?

154
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,720
What are you talking about?

155
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,880
Are you saying he will be...

156
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,640
eaten by that dog with three heads because his partner deserted?

157
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
That would actually be better.

158
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,200
What?

159
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
Do you remember...

160
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
the posters Death Squad put up on the wall?

161
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Posters?

162
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,720
I remember.

163
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,000
The Death Squad with that monstrous dog.

164
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,960
That is not a dog.

165
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,320
What?

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,560
They are grim reapers who are hunting down...

167
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,440
their partners who ran away.

168
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
Does that mean that dog with a human face is...

169
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,280
444's near future?

170
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,640
Will he look like a dog forever if he can't catch his partner?

171
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,000
That darn idiot.

172
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
Don't come near me.

173
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,920
I will really kill this guy.

174
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,120
I will really kill him!

175
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,880
I'm going to kill this guy!

176
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,480
Move!

177
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
Which of them is it?

178
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,000
It's the detective.

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
Detective?

180
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,840
Clear!

181
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm sure my partner...

182
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,800
has gotten into someone's body already.

183
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,000
I need a human's body as well in order to catch him.

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,880
It'd be easier if it's the body of a detective.

185
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,760
I'd be able to carry around a gun.

186
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,160
No. You will get us punished as accomplices.

187
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,840
I can't just watch 444 become a dog.

188
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,480
I will...

189
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,400
catch that idiot myself no matter what.

190
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,560
No!

191
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,920
You're saying...

192
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm dead?

193
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,920
No...

194
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,880
No.

195
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,160
I can't die yet. No.

196
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,200
Everyone says that.

197
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,800
I have to go.

198
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,160
I have to go and ask her...

199
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,200
how she could do that to to me...

200
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
and why!

201
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,520
I can't die like this.

202
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,400
I still have things to do.

203
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,920
No.

204
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,640
No.

205
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,760
No!

206
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
It's amazing how every human says the same thing.

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,560
Where is that idiot hiding?

208
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,520
Could he be there?

209
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,000
Sir.

210
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,120
Miss, that was dangerous.

211
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,760
Sir, please go to this address.

212
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
If you're a decent human being,

213
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
you shouldn't have stolen my girlfriend!

214
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,680
Did you think I was such a big pushover?

215
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,840
Goodness, he won't stop talking.

216
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,680
Just jump off the bridge already.

217
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,360
I'll become a ghost...

218
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,720
and make you pay for this by haunting you!

219
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,600
I shouldn't have let him go by himself.

220
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,400
You were here. We've been looking for you.

221
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,680
We locked him up very safely.

222
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,600
I told you so many times to lock him up carefully!

223
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,960
If Death Squad finds him wandering like that,

224
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
it'll be the end of me!

225
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,920
Do you expect us to watch Moo Gang's soul and neglect our work?

226
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,440
The heavy workload is already killing me.

227
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,320
Miss, shouldn't you go to a hospital?

228
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm fine, sir.

229
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,080
Could you drive a little bit faster, please?

230
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,200
Joon... Joon?

231
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,160
Joon...

232
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,040
Shadows. Those are shadows.

233
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,080
It's Joon.

234
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,000
Sir, please stop the car.

235
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Please stop the car.

236
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,400
No, I can't stop the car on a bridge.

237
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,280
Just for a moment. It's urgent.

238
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,960
Please stop the car. Please.

239
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,599
I'm sorry.

240
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
We locked him up carefully. When did he escape?

241
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
I can't believe I trusted these fools with this.

242
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,839
"These fools"?

243
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,440
You brat. How dare you?

244
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,839
Hey.

245
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,160
- What? - You brat.

246
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
What?

247
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,280
Who do you think caused all this trouble for us?

248
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,480
Who is it?

249
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,640
It's you two.

250
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,360
Move. Move out of the way!

251
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,560
Joon, no!

252
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm glad you're alive.

253
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm so glad...

254
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
you're alive.

255
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,840
What is this?

256
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,280
Is her soul the one I need to collect?

257
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,400
Why do you think she'll die?

258
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,000
She's still young.

259
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,320
Who cares?

260
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,960
Look at that. How coldhearted.

261
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,120
Find out where she lives.

262
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,760
Oh, here it is.

263
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,920
"123-4, Guoh-dong, Guoh-gu".

264
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
Where are you going?

265
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Hey.

266
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,960
Don't you know you cannot teleport with a human?

267
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,320
I know that. I just forgot.

268
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,720
She's really bothersome.

269
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
Be careful.

270
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,680
You can't treat someone sick so roughly.

271
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,120
Hey, be careful. Her head... Legs...

272
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,440
My goodness.

273
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,680
What is this?

274
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,960
Is he her boyfriend?

275
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,560
I guess she's having a tough life.

276
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
Wait a little longer.

277
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,720
I can't take your soul to the underworld yet.

278
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,400
I'll take you as soon as I catch my idiotic partner.

279
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,840
Hang in there a little longer.

280
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,680
(Seoun Police Station)

281
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,920
Have you found anything?

282
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
(Hope Mental Hospital)

283
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,840
The picture we found. Have you found out who it is?

284
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,200
I've looked into it, but we know nothing about the mental patient.

285
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,880
I don't know how to go about it.

286
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,360
Guys, stop wasting your time.

287
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,320
Get all the documents together and send them to Team One by tomorrow.

288
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,600
The order came from the team manager.

289
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,720
Why?

290
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,360
Do your job well, will you?

291
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,240
Your captain keeps losing hair because of you guys.

292
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,800
Why do we have to do that, Captain?

293
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,960
We haven't worked on a case in so long.

294
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,800
If we get it taken away, we'll have nothing from the last six months.

295
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,080
What? Do you really not know the reason?

296
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,160
What on earth did you guys do at the scene?

297
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
You damaged the scene as well as the body.

298
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,280
Do you guys all want to get fired?

299
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,720
Where did all of you idiots come from?

300
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,160
What?

301
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,960
Do you guys think that you work in the Violent Crimes Unit or what?

302
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
Wake up already.

303
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,160
We're in the backup team.

304
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,320
We only work on cases that those in the Violent Crimes Unit...

305
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,920
don't want to take on!

306
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,240
I had to flatter and beg the higher-ups...

307
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,560
to back up the investigation of the mental hospital case.

308
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,120
We got it taken away because you guys ruined everything!

309
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,720
Why did you have to tumble right there?

310
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,960
Why did he bite the arm on the dead body?

311
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,120
- Is he a vampire or what? - Gosh.

312
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,240
I don't even know anymore.

313
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,160
You know that we'll get disbanded if we can't show any results, right?

314
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,720
There are only a few months left in the year.

315
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,680
No department will want you losers.

316
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,760
Hey, just start packing up. Pack up your stuff...

317
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,200
and get ready to go home, okay?

318
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,080
Gosh, those pathetic idiots.

319
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,680
For goodness' sake!

320
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,040
We're in this mess because of Moo Gang.

321
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
Don't you think Captain was out of line?

322
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,480
Losers? How can he call us losers?

323
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,040
Aren't I right, Detective Park?

324
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,600
Oh, boy. Let's do some work, or we'll be called losers again.

325
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,400
We're in this team because we're losers. Just get on with it.

326
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
Gwang Gyun.

327
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,400
You're out of line.

328
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,720
Why are we losers?

329
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,840
Why?

330
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,760
Detective Park, you can't use any firearm...

331
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,040
because of your hand tremors.

332
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,520
That idiot, Moo Gang, throws up every time he sees a dead body...

333
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,480
because he has such a weak stomach.

334
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,480
So Tae, you have to take a leak so often.

335
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,880
You can't even be on a stake-out because you have to keep...

336
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,280
going to the washroom.

337
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,400
Gosh, hearing that is making me want to take a leak again.

338
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,000
What about you, then?

339
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,240
I'm...

340
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,360
I have anger management issues, you punk!

341
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't you know?

342
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,200
Because I can't control my nasty temper,

343
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,240
I bite criminals and get myself in trouble all the time.

344
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
Look at my gray hair. I haven't gotten any promotion until this age,

345
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,680
and all I do is raid internet cafes to catch minors.

346
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm older than most managers.

347
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,000
All team managers in the entire police force avoid me...

348
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
because they don't want to work with me!

349
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,920
What's the matter with him?

350
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,000
We are losers, aren't we?

351
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,760
Let's just admit it already.

352
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,200
I can't admit it. And stop looking at that thing.

353
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,960
They want us to hand all document over.

354
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,160
Shut it.

355
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,200
Detective Park, give me a cigarette.

356
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,880
Hey, we were told to hand them over by tomorrow.

357
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,000
That means the case is ours until the end of today. You're so dumb.

358
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,840
Gosh, I have to relieve myself. Goodness.

359
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,760
Moo Gang?

360
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,120
Why is that idiot caught on this footage?

361
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,040
Hang on, this is...

362
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,360
It was a month before the incident.

363
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,520
What? Was that a dream?

364
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,360
(To: Joon)

365
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,880
Yes, it wasn't a dream.

366
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,440
I saw the shadow beside Joon. I'm sure of it.

367
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,760
I must check.

368
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
It's this house.

369
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,800
My gosh, it still looks exactly like it did 20 years ago.

370
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,600
"19-1, Myeonhee-dong, Mioh-gu".

371
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,200
Who is it?

372
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,240
Who is it?

373
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,560
Who is it, Mom?

374
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,520
I don't know. Who was it?

375
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,560
I think it was a prank.

376
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,960
Let's go in and eat.

377
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,400
So the address is correct.

378
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,280
That means he got all the letters I've sent him.

379
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,400
He's never written me back or called me.

380
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,360
Has he forgotten about me already?

381
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,080
I hate you, Joon. I hate you.

382
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,000
Hey, who are you?

383
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,720
Why are you crying here?

384
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
It's none of your business!

385
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,720
Would he still live here though?

386
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,680
Isn't this his car?

387
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,960
Yes, it is his car.

388
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,600
What if he's passed out alone inside?

389
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,720
My gosh.

390
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,440
Oh, I see Joon.

391
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,360
Thank goodness. The shadow is gone.

392
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,960
Since I'm already here,

393
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,480
I should call him and ask for Lee Jung Bae's number.

394
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,120
The customer you're calling is unavailable at the moment.

395
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,360
Please leave a message after...

396
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,000
What? So he's been ignoring my calls all along?

397
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,240
Unbelievable. I'll never ask you for help again, jerk.

398
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,280
How can he ignore my calls?

399
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,160
Right.

400
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,640
He almost died because of me.

401
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,240
I'd also be sick of me if I were him.

402
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,400
Good.

403
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,080
I've blocked off all passages, so I'll be able to sleep soundly now.

404
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,880
Gosh, I forgot to block that one.

405
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,720
Well, why did you block off all doors?

406
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,880
You locked all doors including the bathroom door.

407
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,960
Hey.

408
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,400
You did that to make sure we can't come in here, right?

409
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,400
Why did I forget to block that one?

410
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,280
Let's just go.

411
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,040
We came all the way here to help you out.

412
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,920
Why did we even want to help you?

413
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,000
All right. What's the matter? What's going on?

414
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,360
You're on the most wanted list now.

415
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,040
- I am? - Yes, you are.

416
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,800
From other Grim Reapers to the Death Squad,

417
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,880
everyone is trying to track you down right now.

418
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,200
You really should've tried to be nicer to others.

419
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,840
You have so many enemies.

420
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,520
I'm sure they're just jealous of me.

421
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,600
Gosh, you make me want to report you to Death Squad right away.

422
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,160
They can try to track me down all they want.

423
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,040
I will not get caught until I find that loser.

424
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,760
It looks like you'll get caught very soon.

425
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,480
Didn't you teleport into a closet...

426
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,200
in the middle of downtown yesterday?

427
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Have you been tailing me?

428
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,000
Someone told the Death Squad that it could've been you.

429
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,320
Be thankful...

430
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,480
that you were seen from behind. That's why you didn't get caught.

431
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,400
The Grim Reapers aren't the problem now.

432
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,040
Don't you know what will happen if humans find out who you are?

433
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,560
You know that things will totally get out of hand.

434
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,360
You've dealt with humans for long enough.

435
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Why can't you act like a human?

436
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,360
- Is it that obvious? - Yes, totally. Anyone can tell!

437
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,520
You picked up the receiver upside down and looked like a pervert.

438
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,160
And how much did you think this designer trench coat was?

439
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,160
Three dollars? Gosh, you idiot.

440
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,440
Just watching humans and having to act like one...

441
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,280
are two totally different things.

442
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,320
Please.

443
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,600
Act like that body is really yours until you find that loser.

444
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,400
Try to really look like a detective.

445
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,960
Only then, you'll be able to get your gun back.

446
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,440
You went into that detective's body...

447
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,680
because of the gun.

448
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,440
Because of a gun? Why?

449
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,280
To drag a fugitive Grim Reaper out of a human body,

450
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,360
we must put a hole right here.

451
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,320
Nothing gets the job done like guns do.

452
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,000
All right, I heard you. Enough, okay?

453
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,240
I'll act like I'm Han Moo Gang until I find the gun and get that loser.

454
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,600
Acting like a detective is easy.

455
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,080
It'll be a piece of cake.

456
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,320
I've seen many souls who died after bluffing like that.

457
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,680
Get lost.

458
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,560
It's easy to be a detective.

459
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,680
I just need to catch criminals.

460
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,000
All right.

461
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,920
Gosh, that's not it. It's right next to...

462
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
It's right next to...

463
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,800
Goodness, how is a fool like him a detective?

464
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,280
It's right over there.

465
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,120
- You know it. - Get off.

466
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
- Wait. - Get off.

467
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,440
- Move it. - Come on.

468
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,360
What are you doing? Go inside,

469
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,720
and take everything we can sell!

470
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,200
- Yes, boss. - What are you doing?

471
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,280
Get off of me.

472
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,400
- Take it all outside! - We don't have time. Move it.

473
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,040
- Take all of these. - Wait.

474
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,680
Do you think we can sell this? Find something better!

475
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,960
Hurry up!

476
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,840
- Find something big! - Let's get it done quickly.

477
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,280
- Hurry! - Darn it!

478
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,680
- What are you doing? - You can't take this!

479
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,200
This is the newest model!

480
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,520
- Let it go, you punk! - I'm still paying installments!

481
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,960
Have you gone crazy?

482
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,240
What...

483
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,360
No... Jin Sook...

484
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
There.

485
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,760
That's right. That's it.

486
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,560
Han Moo Gang, he's a detective. Why are his clothes all so childish?

487
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,480
Hello.

488
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,720
- What is it? - Well...

489
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,920
You had your clothes dry cleaned.

490
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,080
What is this?

491
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,040
You said you often go to funerals because you're a detective.

492
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,720
This is horrible.

493
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,520
Who would beat up a woman like this?

494
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,600
What's the cause of her death?

495
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,680
We'll have to do the autopsy to verify,

496
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,040
but there is a mark of strangulation.

497
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,480
I think someone strangled her.

498
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,920
I've been a gangster for 20 years, and now I'm helping a cop...

499
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,680
Watch your words.

500
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,880
I mean, now I'm helping a detective.

501
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,480
He said he'd quit being a waiter and open up a restaurant,

502
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,240
so I lent him a lot of money.

503
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,640
But we couldn't reach him for a month.

504
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,120
He went in hiding.

505
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,160
I told my boys to catch him, and they caught him in Busan.

506
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
But that jerk said...

507
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
he didn't have money and that we should just kill him.

508
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,680
So I just...

509
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
wanted to kill him, but I didn't.

510
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,920
We brought him here instead...

511
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,680
and tried to sell his things.

512
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
Excuse me. I'm the owner of the store next to his.

513
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,480
- Oh, yes. - His store was closed for a month.

514
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,320
Also, on the day that he opened up his restaurant,

515
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,800
he and his wife had a big fight even though there were customers.

516
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,280
Hey, have you found the victim's husband yet?

517
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,560
He had run away already when I got here,

518
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,720
but a patrol car came just in time.

519
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,200
They blocked all possible escape routes,

520
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,600
so he must be hiding somewhere around here.

521
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
Search every corner, okay?

522
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,920
- Yes, sir. - Okay.

523
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
What?

524
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,880
Detective Han. Isn't that Detective Han?

525
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,840
Darn it. Who called him this time?

526
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,280
Hey, stop him.

527
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,480
I'm begging you to leave.

528
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,240
I even had to wet my pants a bit to get this case.

529
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,960
If we lose it again, our team will be dismissed.

530
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,040
Is this the one?

531
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,760
What's wrong with your hair?

532
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,200
Did you starch it?

533
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,400
This is what detectives apparently do.

534
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,480
They catch the culprit after this.

535
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,000
You don't have to find the culprit.

536
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,240
We already know who it is, so just go. Okay?

537
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,760
Oh, right.

538
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,560
I clearly told you that you'd be working in the office from today.

539
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,800
Didn't I?

540
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,239
How dare you ignore me when I'm talking to you?

541
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,840
- Hey. - You'll break his hand.

542
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,239
Hey, what are you doing?

543
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,280
- I'm sorry. - Are you okay?

544
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,320
It hurts. Let it go.

545
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
He keeps being rude to his superiors.

546
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,760
- Gosh, my dear Detective Oh. - Captain.

547
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,360
- So Tae, great work. - Sure.

548
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,679
After all, he saved...

549
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,360
our team. Well done.

550
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,960
Wait. What are you guys doing here?

551
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,199
So Tae found this first,

552
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,199
so it's our case. You're aware of that, right?

553
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,199
Get out of here!

554
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,679
- Wait, but... - Sir, that's...

555
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,560
- We've got this, okay? - Gosh.

556
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,840
What happened? Didn't you limit access to the scene?

557
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,760
The picture of the dead body is all over the internet now.

558
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,159
When we got here, the body was completely exposed.

559
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,320
There were people taking pictures of it. I couldn't stop it.

560
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,920
Who did this?

561
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,040
We believe it's her husband.

562
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,360
He's hiding somewhere around here, so we'll find him soon.

563
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,880
We'll finally score big time.

564
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,920
- Let's not mess this up, okay? - Yes, sir.

565
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,040
Help me! Help!

566
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,120
- Do something. - What are you doing?

567
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,920
Go to the back, and secure the access!

568
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,680
- Yes, sir. - Move it, you brats!

569
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,080
Hey, hey!

570
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,160
Hey!

571
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,600
All right. Let's talk this out.

572
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,440
Release the woman, and let's talk.

573
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,760
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

574
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,360
I had a fight with my wife that day,

575
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,680
left home, and came back today!

576
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,840
Stay still.

577
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,080
All right, I hear you. Let her go,

578
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,440
and come on down.

579
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,240
We got access through the back door,

580
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,920
but it's dangerous to approach him because of the hostage.

581
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,560
If you try to do something, I'll kill her!

582
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,760
Gosh, wait.

583
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,240
- Don't! - Be on standby.

584
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,440
It's true! I didn't kill my wife!

585
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,720
- Goodness. - You little...

586
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,480
Darn it. Come here!

587
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,360
No. Hey!

588
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,680
- Goodness. - What was that?

589
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,040
You jerk.

590
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,680
Did he shoot it?

591
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,360
Why does he have a gun?

592
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,920
Send a medical team up to the rooftop.

593
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,600
What...

594
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,760
He took it. He took my gun.

595
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,560
- It's not me. I didn't do it. - Stop it.

596
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,000
- Give me the gun. - It's not me!

597
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,240
My goodness. Hey.

598
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,440
- This is the one. - Is it?

599
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,480
Yes, sir.

600
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,120
That punk.

601
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,880
What's this? It was a banana?

602
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,200
Is he really a man who killed his wife?

603
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,160
- No. - Get off of me!

604
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,840
What are you waiting for? Shoot him now!

605
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,640
What are you doing? Shoot him!

606
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,880
He has never fired a gun,

607
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,640
but he hit it right in the center.

608
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,840
We've caught the killer, and the case is closed now.

609
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,120
He's not the one.

610
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,840
Why did you bring him here?

611
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,880
He's not the one who killed that woman.

612
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,360
What is he saying?

613
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,840
- Did he just speak to me casually? - Hold on.

614
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,680
Why do you think he's not the one who killed her?

615
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Here.

616
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,480
Raise it.

617
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,080
Have you lost your mind?

618
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,280
Look at this carefully.

619
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,920
His middle finger is fine.

620
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,440
So? What about it?

621
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,840
Here.

622
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,480
The mark is particularly faint around the middle finger.

623
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,280
That means the killer is missing...

624
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,480
his middle finger at least.

625
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,000
Here. Raise it.

626
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,120
- Raise it. - Goodness.

627
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,240
That's why the ones with normal middle fingers aren't the killer.

628
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,080
I think he's right.

629
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,920
I really...

630
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,360
had a fight with her,

631
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,560
left home that day, and had a hard time...

632
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,080
until those gangsters brought me here today.

633
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,040
There must've been a robber in our restaurant.

634
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Jin Sook.

635
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,640
Hey, hey!

636
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,600
Jin Sook, I'm sorry.

637
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,320
I'm sorry.

638
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,840
- Honey. - What?

639
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,040
I did something good. Give me my gun back.

640
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,400
Give me my gun. Give it back.

641
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,320
You're not in a good state yet.

642
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,040
I'll give it back to you later.

643
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,400
I'm fine. There is no problem!

644
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,120
You saw how clean my shot was.

645
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,120
You can't decide you're okay yourself! I decide it!

646
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,280
Go!

647
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,480
What's wrong with him?

648
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,800
Moo Gang.

649
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,240
You've been to Hope Mental Hospital, right?

650
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,200
Hope?

651
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,040
I have. Why?

652
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,320
Really? Do you remember it?

653
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,040
Why did you go there?

654
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,640
You told me to, Crazy Dog.

655
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,320
I'm not talking about that, you fool.

656
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,000
It's before the director was murdered.

657
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,400
You were on the security camera.

658
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't know. I can't remember.

659
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,040
Is anyone in your family a psychiatrist...

660
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,800
or a mental patient?

661
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,560
What about your friends?

662
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,680
I said I don't know.

663
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,320
I already told you that I can't remember.

664
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,040
Okay, okay.

665
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,560
It's not our jurisdiction anyway. The others will take care of it.

666
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,280
Moo Gang, can you really not remember anything?

667
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,720
No, I can't!

668
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,280
I can't remember anything!

669
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,680
Gosh, okay. I get it. You didn't have to yell at me.

670
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,040
Yes, is this Royeol Hospital?

671
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,920
Do people change that drastically just because of memory loss?

672
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,080
He used to be so nice, but he's so rude now.

673
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,640
And he's even fine with looking at corpses.

674
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
It's just so weird.

675
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,040
He has a bullet stuck in his head.

676
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,440
Let's just tell him to take a leave of absence.

677
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,400
I talked to his doctor a while ago.

678
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,800
There's apparently nothing wrong with his brain.

679
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,400
The doctor thinks it's just a temporary phenomenon.

680
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,720
But he said if we treat him differently because of that,

681
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,680
he might go into shock.

682
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,520
That means we need to treat him like we used to.

683
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,400
That's the only thing that'll work on him.

684
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,480
So even if he treats you with disrespect and does weird stuff,

685
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,040
let's just try to understand him by thinking that...

686
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,440
he's not in his normal state right now. Okay?

687
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,600
- Yes, okay. - He makes me so angry.

688
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,280
- What are you guys up to? - Hey.

689
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,040
Why are you guys drinking coffee without me?

690
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,000
Would you like some too?

691
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,960
Give me that, you short-legged grandpa.

692
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,480
What?

693
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,960
Okay, go ahead.

694
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,520
It tastes interesting.

695
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,120
I understand why humans get addicted to this.

696
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,440
Right, short-legged grandpa?

697
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,760
- You piece of... Hey, let me go. - Calm down.

698
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,160
- Sir, breathe. - Sir.

699
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,600
Let's act naturally like we always did.

700
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,280
Relax. Relax.

701
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,200
(I don't think your father died because of an accident.)

702
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Where am I supposed to find the man who wrote this?

703
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,120
An outrageous murder incident happened this morning.

704
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,080
A woman in her 30s was found frozen...

705
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,920
in her restaurant's freezer.

706
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,640
Her husband is suspected of having murdered her.

707
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
- Move! - My gosh.

708
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm so sorry.

709
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,800
The police are currently investigating him.

710
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,520
Her body was found in the middle of the street this morning.

711
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,640
In just 10 minutes,

712
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,880
- No way. Could it be that woman? - many people started...

713
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,000
uploading photos on the internet, and the police are now...

714
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,320
Fine. Let's just put on a thick face...

715
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,520
and ask Moo Gang for one last favor.

716
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,120
What? Where did my shoelaces go?

717
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,280
Wait.

718
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,880
I stole your contact information from the police station.

719
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Yes.

720
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,280
He might agree to help me.

721
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,600
(Freezer Murder Incident)

722
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,760
After they had a huge fight because of their debt,

723
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,480
Lee Yong Sik, the husband, ends up leaving home.

724
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,200
And ever since then,

725
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,600
they haven't opened the restaurant for around a month.

726
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,320
I looked into Lee Yong Sik's alibi.

727
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,360
And like he claimed, I've confirmed that he's been staying at Busan...

728
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,480
while working at a dry sauna there.

729
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,880
Hey, what's Moo Gang doing in someone else's seat?

730
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,480
He's sullen because he hasn't gotten his gun back.

731
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,560
I'll tell you something as someone...

732
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,480
who's been doing this for a very long time.

733
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,200
These kind of murders mostly happen because of revenge.

734
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,480
So look into people who used to have a bad relationship with the victim.

735
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,400
- Okay? - Yes, sir.

736
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,360
I really can't bear to listen to this.

737
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,960
What?

738
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,480
What can't you bear to listen to?

739
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,160
Hey, short-legged grandpa.

740
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,760
This didn't happen because of revenge.

741
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,360
And why do you think so?

742
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,720
Why don't you think she got murdered because of revenge?

743
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,640
Will you give me back my gun if I tell you?

744
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,920
Okay, I'll give it to you if you're able to convince me.

745
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,680
Fine.

746
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
What?

747
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,040
Hey, why are you heading over there?

748
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,720
Like I told you before, this person got murdered because of revenge.

749
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,440
The murderer was full of hatred.

750
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,280
But this murder was emotionless.

751
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,640
The murderer just killed her by giving her the utmost pain.

752
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,840
It was a coldhearted murder.

753
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,920
The murderer's emotions were as cold...

754
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,680
as ice.

755
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,360
An emotionless murder?

756
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,560
This victim...

757
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,360
didn't choke to death.

758
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,360
She froze to death.

759
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,120
It's a kind of torture.

760
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,000
Torture?

761
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,040
Why? Did she join the independence movement?

762
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,880
Did she take part in the pro-democracy movement?

763
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,960
What kind of era do you think we're living in?

764
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,440
Just go home, you punk!

765
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
My gosh, I listened carefully for nothing.

766
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,600
What?

767
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,480
Okay.

768
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,920
This is crazy.

769
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,120
I can't believe this.

770
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,720
- Why? - What is it?

771
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,960
I just got a call from the NISI.

772
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,080
And they just told me that the victim froze to death.

773
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,280
The murderer froze her when she was still alive.

774
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Moo Gang.

775
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,960
Are you completely sure that...

776
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,040
the victim died because of torture?

777
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,680
Why would anyone torture her?

778
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,720
I don't know.

779
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,360
But don't humans normally torture people when they want information?

780
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,720
What kind of information? What do you think that was?

781
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,600
How am I supposed to know?

782
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,960
Okay, fine.

783
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,160
If that murderer was coldblooded like you told us,

784
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,560
there's no way he would've just...

785
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,160
left her corpse in the restaurant.

786
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,400
Crazy Dog.

787
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,480
You seem to be the smartest one here.

788
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
- You little... - Hey, calm down.

789
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,240
Relax. Relax.

790
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,840
- It's a warning. - What? What warning?

791
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,840
The murderer wants to scare someone by showing them the victim's corpse.

792
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,240
I don't get why humans get so scared every time they see a corpse.

793
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,520
Humans are so petty and uncivilized.

794
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,080
So are you saying the murderer...

795
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,400
purposely left the corpse in the freezer to scare someone...

796
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,560
because that murderer knew that the corpse would one day be found?

797
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,480
That's correct.

798
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,280
And the stupid fool who saw the corpse is probably...

799
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,840
hiding somewhere, shaking in fear.

800
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,640
Jin Sook.

801
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Then does that mean that...

802
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,760
this won't be the last murder?

803
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,240
That means the guy who has no middle finger might kill someone again.

804
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,520
Probably.

805
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,400
If his warning doesn't work, that is.

806
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,480
And there's one more thing.

807
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,440
I can see from the corpse that...

808
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,480
it's been around a month since she died.

809
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,280
Look at him talking nonsense after getting one thing right.

810
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,320
Hey, it's impossible for anyone to...

811
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,520
know when someone died just by looking at the corpse.

812
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,360
How dare he try to lie to us?

813
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,920
Do you have the victim's autopsy results?

814
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,120
Yes. She apparently died 3 to 4 weeks ago.

815
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,800
- 3 to 4 weeks ago? - Yes.

816
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,280
I always see human corpses. This is just a piece of cake.

817
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,080
My gosh.

818
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,560
Hey, short-legged grandpa.

819
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,840
Yes?

820
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,280
Give me back my gun.

821
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,600
No, you can't.

822
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,720
Give it back.

823
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,280
Follow me.

824
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,760
No, you can't.

825
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,280
You can't give it to him.

826
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,000
Be careful when you use it.

827
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,240
- Hey, stop it. - Come on. Stop it.

828
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,040
- My gosh. - Put that down.

829
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,600
- Hey! - Stop it!

830
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,960
- That reckless punk. - What's he doing?

831
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,720
- My gosh, stop it. - That's enough.

832
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,800
I'm sorry, Jin Sook.

833
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,400
It's all my fault.

834
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,560
It's all my fault.

835
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
No way.

836
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,520
She couldn't have spilled any information about me, right?

837
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,400
No.

838
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,240
He would've come for me if she did.

839
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,480
Don't be scared.

840
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,800
I'm not the one who killed your friend.

841
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,360
Long time no see, Sun Young.

842
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,200
Can you recognize me now?

843
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,440
This jerk uses the same method as he used to 20 years ago.

844
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,000
I just...

845
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,800
escaped from the mental hospital.

846
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,880
So I want you to help me with something.

847
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,320
(Royeol Insurance)

848
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,800
Why did he ask me to meet him here?

849
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,360
What's this guy doing here?

850
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,360
Is he a model?

What?

853
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,160
Chunsu Insurance...

854
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,520
became Royeol Insurance?

855
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
Excuse me.

856
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,200
Excuse me, is there a man named Lee Jung Bae working here?

857
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,000
Okay.

858
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,680
What? Hey, you're here.

859
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,600

(President, Oh Man Soo)

00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,480
(Employee Search, Lee Jung Bae)

862
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,000
He retired right before Chunsu Insurance became Royeol Insurance.

863
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,040
- He quit? - Yes.

864
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,280
Then do you at least have his address?

865
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,160
I don't think this will be of any use.

866
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,880
He quit because he had plans to emigrate abroad.

867
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,160
Then can I check the insurance records of a client...

868
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,720
named Kang Soo Hyuk?

869
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,600
He's my father. He passed away.

870
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,760
Oh, okay. Was it Kang Soo Hyuk?

871
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,400
Kang Soo Hyuk.

872
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,760
(No client information exists under that name.)

873
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,640
Are you sure he used to be a client at Chunsu Insurance?

874
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,560
He must've been. That's probably why...

875
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,240
Lee Jung Bae took part...

876
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,400
in investigating my dad's death.

877
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,560
Yes, it could've been that.

878
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,760
Or it could've been because your dad was involved in...

879
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,200
another client's murder incident.

880
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,040
I see.

881
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,520
Don't be too disappointed.

882
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,760
The company might still have the investigation materials.

883
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,000
Would you like me to look for them?

884
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,440
Thank you. Thank you.

885
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,560
Just a second.

886
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,560
Hey, I'd like you to find a document for me.

887
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,760
It's a document from 20 years ago. It's from 1997...

888
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,160
when it used to be Chunsu Insurance.

889
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,120
What?

890
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,280
Okay, I understand.

891
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,480
What did they say?

892
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,600
That's weird.

893
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,920
Everything from 1997 aren't in the database.

894
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,040
But all the documents from Chunsu Insurance...

895
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,720
are also kept in paper copies.

896
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,360
So the documents from 1997 might still exist.

897
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,800
What do you say?

898
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,560
Should I ask my employee...

899
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,320
to look for it file by file?

900
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,240
Would that be okay?

901
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,600
Don't you know who I am?

902
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,360
I'm the president of this company.

903
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,760
Thank you. Thank you so much.

904
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,960
Her cell phone was turned off.

905
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,880
So when I went to her house because I got worried, but no one was there.

906
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,560
Plus, the restaurant she had opened with her husband wasn't even open.

907
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,000
But are you saying that she died?

908
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,720
Yes, she died.

909
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,640
By any chance, are there any employees...

910
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,800
who have a missing middle finger or a missing joint...

911
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,080
on their right hand?

912
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,880
No, there's no one like that.

913
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,040
Then is there anyone who weren't on good terms...

914
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,840
with Ms. Han Jin Sook?

915
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,640
No. She had a really nice personality.

916
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,840
Even her customer evaluation was always great.

917
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,760
I see. Okay.

918
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,280
May I meet your president before I leave?

919
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,880
Sure, come with me.

920
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,120
Okay.

921
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,080
Moo Gang.

922
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,560
Stay here, and wait for me to come back.

923
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,520
Bye.

924
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,280
Sip Gyeon, my brother. Where did he go?

925
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,560
- Hey. - Hello, sir.

926
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
Have you seen Sip Gyeon?

927
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,920
He's playing with the Planning Team's employees.

928
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,200
I wonder if they sterilized their hands before touching him.

929
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,320
Sir, wait. He's the president of our company.

930
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,320
Nice to meet you.

931
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,080
Bang.

932
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,000
What are you doing, you old dog? Go away.

933
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,640
Leave.

934
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,880
Why is there a dog in the company?

935
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,960
Let me go! Let me go!

936
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,480
- Are you okay? - Let me go!

937
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
My gosh, are you okay?

938
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,360
How could you bite him?

939
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,680
One of my employees is the victim of that recent freezer murder?

940
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,120
Yes.

941
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,800
Can you tell your employees to cooperate with our investigation?

942
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,160
Yes, of course. I'll announce that to everyone.

943
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,280
We should all cooperate as much as we can.

944
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,440
Okay, thank you.

945
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,800
I'll be off now.

946
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,200
Okay. Bye.

947
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,960
Bye.

948
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,720
Bye.

949
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,360
Who's Han Jin Sook?

950
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,080
Sir, we have a problem.

951
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,160
What?

952
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,640
I'm so sorry.

953
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,080
Sip Gyeon has never bitten anyone in his life.

954
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,640
He's normally a really nice dog.

955
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,560
I wonder why he bit you.

956
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,400
I really can't understand why.

957
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,800
Did you hit him?

958
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,800
What's that dog's identity?

959
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,080
You're quick-witted.

960
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,680
You must know a lot about dogs.

961
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,720
Yes, that's right. Let me tell you a little about my brother.

962
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,000
He's the descendant of a Saint Bernard,

963
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,240
the dog that's good at finding corpses.

964
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
What?

965
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,520
The dog that's good at finding corpses?

966
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,680
Yes.

967
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,960
Did he smell the dead Han Moo Gang?

968
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,160
Well, to be exact, he's a descendant of that breed from...

969
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,600
eight generations ago. He's actually mixed with a lot of other dogs.

970
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,360
That's why he kind of looks like a bulldog...

971
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,600
and keeps doing weird stuff like eating his own feces and urine.

972
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,080
But if you go up his family ladder,

973
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,880
he definitely has the blood of a Saint Bernard.

974
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,320
I guess he smelled the dead body of Han Moo Gang.

975
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,320
I should be careful from now on.

976
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,800
It's all done now.

977
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,480
Wait here.

978
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,120
I'll pay for your treatment.

979
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,760
What?

980
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,400
Did you just avoid bumping into me?

981
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,440
Can you see me?

982
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,040
Yes, I'm at the hospital.

983
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,160
Yes.

984
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,800
That's right.

985
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,600
Okay, I'll be right there.

986
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
Okay.

987
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,520
Yes, okay.

988
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,960
Maybe not.

989
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,560
Hurry up.

990
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,160
Why did he have to emigrate abroad?

991
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,200
He didn't even leave behind his contact number abroad.

992
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,480
I wish I'd at least be able to find the documents.

993
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,160
I'm going to catch the culprit no matter what,

994
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,320
and make that person pay for my dad's death.

995
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,800
Sip Gyeon, my brother...

996
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,640
My gosh, what are you doing here?

997
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,360
I'm sorry.

998
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,240
It took you 20 beatings to say that today.

999
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,960
You must've become quite resilient.

1000
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,880
What do you think you did wrong this time?

1001
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,080
(Victim of the Freezer Murder Was an Employee at Royeol Insurance)

1002
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,360
(Due to the Freezer Murder, Royeol Insurance's Credibility Plummets)

1003
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,360
How long has it been since you started working here?

1004
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,600
How could you fail to stop articles like this from getting published?

1005
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,000
I now understand why an employee at our company would proudly say...

1006
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,200
that he signed up as our competing insurance company's client.

1007
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,000
Countless people are canceling their insurance contract with us.

1008
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,760
I didn't even know about these articles.

1009
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,560
How am I supposed to sell this company to China...

1010
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,840
if these kind of articles just got published?

1011
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,240
I'm sorry.

1012
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,120
I'll...

1013
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,480
do a better job.

1014
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,000
I never told you to do a better job.

1015
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,840
Just don't do anything.

1016
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,440
Don't try to do anything for the company.

1017
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,960
Just keep fooling around...

1018
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,920
with those celebrity friends of yours like you always do.

1019
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,480
Sir.

1020
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,520
I'll be sure to accomplish things...

1021
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,800
so that the company doesn't go under.

1022
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,360
You and your lowborn blood.

1023
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,720
Is that why your brain doesn't work? Do you not understand what I said?

1024
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,520
I don't need you to accomplish anything!

1025
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,320
Just leave things as they are now.

1026
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,720
I need you to report things to me so that we can prevent such articles.

1027
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,720
That's why I gave you this position. You got that?

1028
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,040
Okay.

1029
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,200
I'll do as you say.

1030
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,720
(Resume, Name: Han Jin Sook)

1031
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,000
What? This woman...

1032
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,040
I work as an insurance planner at Royeol Insurance.

1033
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,080
My name is Han Jin Sook.

1034
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,040
It's her. That's right.

1035
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,040
The shadow of death.

1036
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,920
She'll die soon too.

1037
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,520
I'm getting goosebumps.

1038
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,440
That woman must really be a fortune-teller.

1039
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,040
Hang on.

1040
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,320
Miss!

1041
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,040
Where did she go? Goodness. Miss!

1042
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,720
Gosh, this woman is really something.

1043
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,560
She got the rent deposit back.

1044
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,680
Is she moving out or what?

1045
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,040
Miss!

1046
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,040
Miss!

1047
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,000
Hi, Ms. Fortune-teller.

1048
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,520
Miss!

1049
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,680
- What are you doing here? - What?

1050
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,920
- Why is your place so messy? - Did you find the document?

1051
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,320
Well, I'm doing my best to find it.

1052
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,440
I thought you found it already.

1053
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,000
What's up? Why are you here?

1054
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,480
Do you remember that woman you said will die soon?

1055
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,520
She got killed.

1056
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,040
Is she...

1057
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,640
the woman who died in the freezer?

1058
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,920
Did you see it on the news?

1059
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,520
Right, the video of her body is going viral on social media.

1060
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,840
Yes, it is her.

1061
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,960
Gosh, so what? Why are you here?

1062
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,800
I'm just really curious.

1063
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,280
What kind of spirit do you channel?

1064
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,680
An enlightened person? An army general? A kid? An old lady?

1065
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,400
If you keep going on with your nonsense,

1066
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,840
you might experience a whole new level of craziness when I lose it.

1067
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,600
Leave. Get out of my place!

1068
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,840
Gosh, don't get me wrong. Please calm down. Let's sit down.

1069
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,920
Oh, sorry.

1070
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,080
I'd like to make a surprising offer to you.

1071
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,920
That's why I came all the way to this shabby place of yours.

1072
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,120
- An offer? - Aren't you about to be evicted...

1073
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,320
because you can't pay your rent deposit?

1074
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,560
How about a six-figure salary? If you join Royeol Insurance,

1075
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,360
you'll make 100,000 dollars a year and get full benefits.

1076
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,640
You'll also get 400 percent bonus.

1077
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,120
What's the job for? Even a newbie gets paid that much?

1078
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,240
It's very simple.

1079
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,200
What we need is your ability, your clairvoyance.

1080
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,080
- Sorry? - To put it simply,

1081
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,840
insurance investigators investigate into causes of death after the fact.

1082
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,440
But in your case,

1083
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,160
you'll investigate before the deaths occur.

1084
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,600
Why though? Why is such a thing necessary?

1085
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,280
That's...

1086
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,560
To tell you the truth, I'm about to lose my job as the CEO...

1087
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,760
even though I was appointed only a few days ago.

1088
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,120
I must make sure we can show some results,

1089
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,520
but it'll take a long time to get more customers.

1090
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:46,000
It's practically impossible now because our employee died.

1091
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,440
There's only one way.

1092
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,640
We must reduce the amount of our insurance payouts.

1093
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,320
We pay our VVIP customers a lot because of their life insurances.

1094
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,480
So...

1095
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,040
are you asking me to prevent their expensive deaths?

1096
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,120
You're a piece of trash.

1097
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,960
- Trash? - Hey, get out. Get lost.

1098
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,320
- Gosh, wait. - Get lost!

1099
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,560
If you want more money...

1100
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,640
- How about 200,000 dollars? - Are you deaf?

1101
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,080
I told you I don't want the job. Get out.

1102
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,320
- Get out right now! - Hang on a second.

1103
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,800
- Please consider my offer. - I told you to get out. Get out.

1104
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,960
- Leave. Get out of my place. - Please think about it.

1105
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,000
Ms. Fortune-teller.

1106
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,080
If you want more than 200,000, we can negotiate!

1107
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,040
Joon almost died.

1108
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,720
I won't try to save anyone's life ever again.

1109
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,800
I should visit that loser's sister again at her school.

1110
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,480
Goodness, where do you think you're going?

1111
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,840
It's Han Jin Sook's call history for a month before she died.

1112
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,560
We don't have time, so each of you should call 30 numbers. Start now!

1113
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,000
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

1114
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,240
The youngest one should go first.

1115
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,360
- Okay. - Got it.

1116
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,240
Moo Gang, where are you going? You need to call these numbers!

1117
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,120
Hello? I'm calling from Seoun Police Station.

1118
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,160
At around 5pm on September 4...

1119
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,800
Do you know Han Jin Sook?

1120
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,720
Are you the killer?

1121
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,720
You killed Han Jin Sook, didn't you?

1122
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,920
Tell me the truth. You killed her, right?

1123
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,880
What was that about?

1124
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,920
Why did he swear at me? These uncivilized, crude humans.

1125
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,560
Hey, can you guys do something about that idiot?

1126
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,720
Hey, don't call.

1127
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,880
I'll do it. I'll just do it for you. Don't call anyone else.

1128
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,240
I have to do my job. As a detective...

1129
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,240
I'll do it for you! Forget it, seriously. I'll do it.

1130
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,320
(My darling Soo Wan)

1131
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,640
What's this? "My darling Soo Wan"? Who is this?

1132
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,480
Hey, why are you calling your girlfriend?

1133
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,600
Just hang up.

1134
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,720
This number is on this list.

1135
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,400
My darling Soo Wan...

1136
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,720
You know this woman, right?

1137
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,080
Yes. I bought an insurance plan from her a month ago.

1138
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,720
Why do you ask?

1139
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,920
Insurance?

1140
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,720
How do you know her?

1141
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,760
She came to the hospital due to a collision accident.

1142
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,400
I got a plan from her because I felt bad for her.

1143
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,160
She was murdered a little while ago.

1144
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,960
Pardon me?

1145
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,520
She died?

1146
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,520
You spoke with her on the phone, right?

1147
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,760
She called me to thank me for buying the insurance plan from her.

1148
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,160
She told me that she'd send me a gift.

1149
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,440
Was that all?

1150
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:25,040
According to the call history, you two spoke for five minutes.

1151
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:30,160
She asked me a bunch of questions about her delayed symptoms.

1152
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,920
By any chance,

1153
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,960
did you sense anything strange during the phone conversation?

1154
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,080
Anything strange?

1155
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,600
Did she sound overly anxious, sensitive,

1156
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,200
or hyper than usual?

1157
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,960
I'm not sure.

1158
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,160
Not that I recall.

1159
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,440
Thank you for your cooperation. Take care.

1160
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,680
Let's go.

1161
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,520
Moo Gang.

1162
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,760
The call history won't get leaked, right?

1163
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,200
I don't know.

1164
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,080
What is this mess, Sip Gyeon?

1165
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,520
Attention!

1166
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,720
Gosh, these are important documents.

1167
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,200
What?

1168
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,240
I already said no. Why are you here again?

1169
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,720
I found the document you wanted me to find.

1170
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,920
What? Seriously?

1171
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,800
- Give it to me. - Back off!

1172
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,520
Nothing in life comes free.

1173
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,520
I'll give it to you if you accept my offer.

1174
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,280
- Did you actually find it? - Of course!

1175
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,920
Your dad had a tattoo, right?

1176
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,560
About this size.

1177
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,680
What?

1178
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,760
How dare you lie to my face?

1179
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,800
Leave! I don't want to hear your nonsense.

1180
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,440
I heard that the man had a tattoo on the back of his hand.

1181
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,120
Police officers can't have any tattoos, okay?

1182
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,440
For goodness' sake.

1183
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,040
What is it, then?

1184
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,720
It is him.

1185
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,640
Did I read the wrong document?

1186
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,440
Did you say it's on the back of his hand?

1187
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,120
Yes.

1188
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,880
What does it look like?

1189
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,560
Oh, the tattoo?

1190
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,200
A spider. It was a spider tattoo.

1191
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,560
- Give me that. Right now! - Gosh, hang on. Then...

1192
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,440
I brought your contract. I even brought a stamp ink pad.

1193
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,520
(Employee: Kang Ha Ram)

1194
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,080
Are you sure you don't want any money?

1195
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,800
How many times do I have to tell you? I just want that document.

1196
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,960
All right. Here's our VVIP list.

1197
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,120
They're our highest-paying clients.

1198
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,280
For us, Royeol Group,

1199
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,960
they must not die in any circumstances...

1200
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,960
because they pay us so much.

1201
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,960
You're just as unimpressive as I thought you'd be.

1202
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,840
You use people's weaknesses.

1203
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,000
Just make sure you keep your word. If you don't,

1204
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,279
I'll crush that face of yours.

1205
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,399
My goodness.

1206
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Right, I am unimpressive indeed.

1207
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,279
I'm so pathetic.

1208
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,600
He'll show up here if he cared about his sister a lot.

1209
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
My gosh!

1210
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,479
That guy over there.

1211
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,920
Did he nearly die recently by any chance?

1212
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,160
Oh, how did you know?

1213
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:17,439
He jumped from the roof recently because his grades went down.

1214
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,359
Thankfully, he fell on a tree before he hit the ground.

1215
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:21,840
That's why he didn't die.

1216
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,800
Is that right?

1217
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,760
The next one is Cha Min Joo, the daughter of Hwangje Group's owner.

1218
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,359
A grade 10 teacher at Seungri High School?

1219
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,560
(Cha Min Joo)

1220
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,000
What?

1221
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,520
Why is that girl here?

1222
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,160
What is that?

1223
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,120
It's inside his body.

1224
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,440
My gosh, the shadow is inside his body.

1225
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,240
What does that mean?

1226
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,840
What kind of question is that?

1227
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,000
You know everything. Why do you keep acting like you know nothing?

1228
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,800
You know the fact that I see the shadow...

1229
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,360
and that the person with the shadow...

1230
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,160
always dies. You know all of that.

1231
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,520
What?

1232
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,320
Stay for three more minutes.

1233
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,040
What are you saying? Let go.

1234
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,560
Then wait for just a minute.

1235
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,800
You...

1236
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,800
Do you really see us... I mean,

1237
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,960
can you really see it?

1238
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,480
Gosh.

1239
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,640
I've never seen anything like that before.

1240
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,800
The ones I've seen before were always just beside the bodies.

1241
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,000
I've never seen the shadow inside anyone's body.

1242
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,560
Gosh, it's giving me the creeps.

1243
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,160
Inside the body? You mean, inside a human body?

1244
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,160
- Who? Who is it? - Gosh.

1245
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,080
Over there. The boy at the very back.

1246
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,480
- What? - There.

1247
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,760
The one sitting by the window. That boy over there.

1248
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,800
Where?

1249
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,440
Well... Over there...

1250
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,240
That boy.

1251
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,120
Why are you doing this to me?

1252
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,640
Come out of there, loser.

1253
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,720
Are you 444?

1254
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,560
Did you think I'd never be able to find you?

1255
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,600
Come out of there before I put a hole through that head!

1256
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,480
No, I won't get out of this body.

1257
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,920
I want to live as a human again.

1258
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,000
I regret taking my own life.

1259
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,240
Please. Give me a chance, please.

1260
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,240
I don't want to leave this body!

1261
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,000
Fine.

1262
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,240
Then I have no choice but to drag you out of there.

1263
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,200
You should've done that to save me all this trouble.

1264
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,200
What?

1265
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,920
You're...

1266
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,800
Please let me live.

1267
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,520
Can you just pretend you never saw me?

1268
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,360
Why did you come out of his body?

1269
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,640
Then was the guy who came to the emergency room...

1270
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,640
I was also a 12th grader.

1271
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,000
I took some pills and killed myself because of my poor grades.

1272
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,200
I came down here to collect that boy's soul...

1273
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,960
and kept thinking about my life before death.

1274
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,000
I couldn't stop thinking about my parents, so...

1275
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,320
I want to go back to being a student. I want to study hard...

1276
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,880
and also tell my parents...

1277
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,560
that I'm sorry about leaving them like that.

1278
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,920
So please.

1279
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,600
Could you please pretend you never saw me here?

1280
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,320
Please. I beg you.

1281
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,080
Please.

1282
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,320
Right, I forgot for a second.

1283
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,920
You're 444.

1284
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,240
Hey.

1285
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,640
I heard that you're a fugitive now though.

1286
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,120
If I get dragged back there, I'll tell everyone about you,

1287
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,960
so do whatever you want.

1288
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,040
The Death Squad?

1289
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,160
Call them.

1290
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,080
Go ahead and call them. Call them!

1291
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,120
Calm down.

1292
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,760
I heard you. Go back in there.

1293
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,880
I said, go back in.

1294
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,760
Will you really let it slide?

1295
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,800
Yes.

1296
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,200
I guess all the rumors about you aren't true, 444.

1297
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,280
What? What are you doing right now?

1298
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,960
So you jumped from here, right?

1299
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,560
I told you that I'll tell everyone about you if you do this to me.

1300
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,360
There's one thing you don't know because you're a newbie.

1301
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,120
If the body you're in dies again...

1302
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,880
when you're inside of it,

1303
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,760
you'll forget all the memories you had when you lived as that body.

1304
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,440
You won't remember me.

1305
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,480
007! 007.

1306
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,640
Have you heard?

1307
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:16,360
Remember that newbie Grim Reaper who ran away a little while ago?

1308
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,840
The Death Squad caught him.

1309
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,120
What will happen to him now?

1310
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,840
So he's her stepbrother.

1311
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,240
That episode has aired three times already.

1312
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,440
In the next episode, they find out that they're not related at all.

1313
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,760
In the final episode, they get married...

1314
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,320
and have quintuplets.

1315
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,960
Have some manners, will you? Why did you tell me the whole story?

1316
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,960
This isn't important right now!

1317
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,520
How dare you! You little...

1318
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,200
My gosh!

1319
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,440
I totally admire you.

1320
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,040
You make my heart burn, I love you

1321
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,720
You look like Brad in "Meet Joe Black".

1322
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,760
Bread?

1323
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,440
Oh, you know. Angelina Jolie's ex-husband, Brad.

1324
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,800
Anyway,

1325
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,080
where are you going in the middle of the night all dressed up?

1326
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,280
I came up with a brilliant idea to catch that loser.

1327
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,560
A brilliant idea? What is it?

1328
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,120
Eyes.

1329
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,760
You disappeared earlier.

1330
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,880
What brings you here this late?

1331
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,240
Listen.

1332
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,120
Joon is...

1333
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,400
I mean, Han Moo Gang. You said he's your first love, right?

1334
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,400
Sorry?

1335
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,720
I'm talking about Joon, Han Moo Gang.

1336
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,120
In other words, me.

1337
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,760
You like me, don't you?

1338
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,200
That's... Well...

1339
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Then stay right by my side at all times like glue.

1340
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,680
From this moment,

1341
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,200
I need you to be my eyes.

1342
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,720
(Black)

1343
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,880
That means I didn't die because of her.

1344
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,000
I can't believe he lost his memory. This is all because of me.

1345
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,880
Let me go!

1346
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,000
I'm going to save Royeol Insurance no matter what.

1347
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,040
He disguised it into an accident and killed him on purpose.

1348
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,000
Who keeps trying to kill Han Moo Gang?

1349
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,760
As long as that's gone, they won't be able to do anything to me.

1350
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,800
Help me.

1351
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,280
Just do as I say.
