1
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,640
Gosh. Where did it go?

2
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
I found it!

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
My gosh.

4
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,080
Yes, this may bring back some memories.

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,120
Gosh, hey!

6
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
What on earth happened?

7
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
I looked everywhere for you all day long.

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,320
Who is this boy?

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,680
- He's your brother. - Brother?

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,480
Where is he now?

11
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm asking you where he is.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
He died.

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
He died?

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Yes.

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
A few days after taking this picture.

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,400
Is this your son's? Please check what's inside.

17
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,120
Moo...

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
It looks like it was a hit-and-run accident.

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
Moo... Moo Chan!

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
In the end, the hit-and-run driver...

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,520
was never caught.

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,639
It seems like it was only yesterday when Moo Chan died,

23
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,640
but two decades have passed already.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
Moo Chan?

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,720
Wasn't his name Kim Joon?

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,960
That's right. His name was Kim Joon.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,600
He changed his name when he came to live with us.

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,240
He wanted to have his dad's surname,

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,480
so we named him as Han Moo Chan.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,200
He wanted...

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,560
to erase the memories from the time that he lived with his birth mom.

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,240
Your dad had him with a woman he met...

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,000
when he was teaching at a university in Moojin...

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,079
for a short amount of time before he met me.

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,440
His birth mom asked us to look after him for a little while,

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
saying that something came up.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,920
We said we'd take care of him because we felt bad for her,

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,760
and you were also very happy...

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,680
about getting a big brother.

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,160
The two of you...

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,040
cared so much about each other.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,360
Moo Chan...

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,480
also adored you a lot and was always there for you.

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
Even though he was only a year older than you,

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,960
he really was like a big brother to you.

46
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,800
So that girl's first love died a long time ago.

47
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,079
Then what's this?

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Moo Chan used to wear it all the time.

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,280
He was wearing it when he got into the accident as well.

50
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,520
You've always been wearing it and said it's a keepsake from him.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,640
They sure are brothers. They look very much like each other.

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Anyway, if that girl finds out that her first love is actually dead...

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,120
Joon. Joon.

54
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,480
Joon?

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,920
What... What's going on? Why are you here at this hour?

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,520
It's cold outside. Why are you sitting out here?

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,160
You even left your gate doors open.

58
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,320
This is yours.

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
What is this?

60
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,920
You gave it to me when you were moving to Seoul.

61
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,600
You asked me to hold onto it and treasure it.

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,640
All the girls at school fell head over heels for you...

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,840
when you sang while playing this guitar.

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,040
Play it now, Joon.

65
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Me?

66
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,400
I don't know how to play this. No. I mean, I forgot it all.

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
I lost my memory, you know.

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,800
I read somewhere that your body remembers everything...

69
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,720
even if you lost your memory.

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,480
Don't be like that, and just try it.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Come on. Do it.

72
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,680
My memory... I don't really remember how to do it.

73
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
What's going on here? I can't get this open.

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
I can't open it.

75
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,159
- It doesn't open? - No, just take it back.

76
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,480
Right, it's never been opened for 20 years.

77
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
Oh, you have tools at home, right?

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,120
What?

79
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,680
Hey, wait. Hey.

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,400
What on earth is this?

81
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,800
I obviously don't know how to play this human instrument.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Do I?

83
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
What is this thing?

84
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,440
Give it to me. I'm really good at fixing things like this.

85
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,360
But you don't have to...

86
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,200
Give it to me. Come on, give it to me.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,200
- What? - What is it?

88
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,840
- That's strange. - What?

89
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,920
When you said you wanted to be a police officer after meeting my dad,

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,040
those delinquents...

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm going to become a police officer.

92
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
So I don't want to hang out with you.

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,640
A police officer? We were going to recruit you since you fight well.

94
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,560
But what? You little brat!

95
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,520
How dare you scowl at me like that?

96
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,320
Do you want me to poke your eyes out?

97
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,800
Hey! Do you want me to pound your heads in a mortar?

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,600
Get off me, you brat!

99
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,640
It left a deep scar, but it's gone.

100
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,360
Hey, that's enough.

101
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
What time is it? What are you doing? Get home now.

102
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm exhausted. Get home quickly.

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,080
What? What is this?

104
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,840
- What is it? - It's... It's nothing.

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
What? Is that a picture of a naked woman?

106
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
No... No, it isn't.

107
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,080
I bet it is.

108
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,280
Why are you hiding it then? Let me see.

109
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,840
Let me see it.

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,720
Give it to me. Give it to me.

111
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,800
Give... Give it to me.

112
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
Joon, your first love, is dead.

113
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,520
Yes. It's better for you not to know.

114
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I...

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,280
- Just go home now. Go. - Okay.

116
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,520
- Just let me get my bag. - I'm exhausted.

117
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,760
- Gosh. - It's so late at night. Go home.

118
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,880
Fine. I'm going.

119
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
This is too much. Seriously.

120
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,600
What? Why is this here?

121
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,600
Isn't this that stone?

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
Seriously.

123
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,720
Gosh. This is why I painted it white.

124
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,400
Joon.

125
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,000
This isn't Joon. Of course there is no scar.

126
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,280
What is that anyway?

127
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,040
Gosh, I'm sure she will keep asking me to play it. Won't she?

128
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,880
Where did she find it?

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,600
Hey. Have they issued an arrest warrant for Oh Sang Min yet?

130
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Not yet.

131
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,159
Hello?

132
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
What?

133
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Okay.

134
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,760
Gwang Gyun, they rejected to issue a warrant.

135
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
What?

136
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,480
That darn prosecutor.

137
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,400
He's coming out!

138
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,920
- He's coming out! - Please tell us what happened.

139
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,280
- Why did you hide the truth? - Why did you assault her?

140
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
- Stop right there! - Please give us a comment.

141
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,320
How do you feel right now?

142
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,560
You did well. Stand tall and proud.

143
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,320
How do you feel right now?

144
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Please give us a comment.

145
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,280
How do you feel right now?

146
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
Hello, Senator Nam.

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,320
Thank you for your concerns.

148
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,920
You know I always return favors, right?

149
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,760
The prosecution rejected to issue a warrant.

150
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,320
According to the authorities, the reason of the rejection...

151
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,919
is because it's his first offense, and he admitted his wrongdoings...

152
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,679
and regretted it deeply.

153
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,480
Moreover, they've decided that...

154
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,440
it's unlikely that he will try to destroy the evidence or run away.

155
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,880
He's regretting it, and he won't run away?

156
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,720
As they rejected to issue an arrest warrant...

157
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,000
Uncle Man Soo. What happened to your neck?

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
Do you wear Sip Gyeon's leash or something?

159
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,200
Is it some kind of fashion?

160
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
I must find proof that Man Ho tried to kill me no matter what.

161
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
That's right.

162
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,080
There was a witness.

163
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
You didn't see it?

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,440
You ran towards the door to catch the killer.

165
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,840
- Did I? - Yes.

166
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,120
I was just going to check if someone had come in,

167
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,520
but I couldn't because you hung on to me.

168
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,920
Persistently.

169
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,000
You really didn't see anything?

170
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,640
No. I'm busy.

171
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Wait.

172
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
"My boss"?

173
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
What?

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,280
Detective Han. Wait...

175
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
That's strange.

176
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm sure...

177
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,720
that I saw him grabbing the killer's hair.

178
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,880
Was I mistaken?

179
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,280
Do you all wish to die?

180
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,120
Crazy Dog. I know you're crazy,

181
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,640
but how could you attack a prosecutor?

182
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,440
- You should all know better. - Yes. We're sorry, sir.

183
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,200
You should all know better.

184
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,920
What's going on?

185
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Here.

186
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,600
Teach me how to use social media.

187
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,120
Hey. Can't you see what's going on here?

188
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,440
- What? - Gwang Gyun is in trouble.

189
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,640
He bit the prosecutor on Oh Sang Min's case.

190
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,800
He's Crazy Dog indeed.

191
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,560
Anyway, teach me how to use social media.

192
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,480
Are you serious?

193
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,000
Gwang Gyun is going through all that trouble because of you.

194
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Hurry up now.

195
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,920
- Seriously? - Hey, just give it to me.

196
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,480
I'll teach you, you brat.

197
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,200
Gosh, that brat.

198
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,440
What do I do from here?

199
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,880
Gosh. I have no witness...

200
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
or evidence.

201
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't see Byung Ho either. This is driving me crazy.

202
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,360
Sip Gyeon.

203
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,960
Sip Gyeon?

204
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
Sip Gyeon.

205
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,160
Who are you?

206
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,080
Let go of me. Who are you? Get off me!

207
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,080
What are you doing? Get off me!

208
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,400
Darn it. Let go of me!

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,600
What are you doing? Are you going to kill me out in the open now?

210
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I know you resent me and all,

211
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
but how could you accuse me...

212
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,640
as a scum who kills his own brother?

213
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,080
Are you still playing innocent with me, you jerk?

214
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
- Get off me! - This is driving me crazy.

215
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,480
I heard you went around looking for witnesses all day.

216
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
So did you find one?

217
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,800
Did you find anyone who saw me trying to kill you?

218
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,160
I guess you didn't. Too bad.

219
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
Bring it in.

220
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,840
- Sip Gyeon... Sip Gyeon! - Hey, Mr. Witness.

221
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,200
Let go of me, you jerk!

222
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,280
- Hey, Oh Man Ho! - Did I try to kill Man Soo?

223
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,960
Say something. This is so unfair.

224
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,120
- I will kill you if you touch him. - He's not saying anything.

225
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,800
- Let go of me! - Sip Gyeon. Will you not tell me?

226
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
I asked you if I tried to kill Man Soo!

227
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Man Ho.

228
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Please don't.

229
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,280
Now, you know whom you're talking to.

231
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,800
You called me a jerk earlier.

232
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm sorry. You should hit me instead.

233
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,000
- I know, right? - Yes.

234
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,000
- Get the dog out. - You old lag!

235
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,480
If you didn't want to take the blame for Sang Min,

236
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
you should've at least stayed quiet.

237
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,480
How dare you threaten me, you old lag?

238
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,720
You petty jerk! You old lag.

239
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,440
This darn dog!

240
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,080
Get off me! You stupid dog.

241
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,680
This darn dog.

242
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,920
- No... No! No! - Darn it.

243
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,320
How dare you bite people?

244
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,200
If you don't want the same thing to happen to you,

245
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,760
sign this.

246
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,120
Hey, Oh Man Soo!

247
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,000
Sign it now. Let me help you.

248
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,320
Come here.

249
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,320
How nice is it when you're being such a good boy?

250
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
I just realized once again...

251
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,600
that this is such a nice country to live in.

252
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
They are generous to minors...

253
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,320
and conglomerates.

254
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,480
And they couldn't issue the warrant when my dad pulled some strings.

255
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,840
Do they think I'm an idiot?

256
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,760
How could I mistake marijuana for tobacco?

257
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
Hey.

258
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,280
Yes, I saved one for you.

259
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,320
- What is that? - It's him, right?

260
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,960
- Isn't that marijuana? - The prosecution...

261
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,480
had denied the request for a warrant by lack of evidence...

262
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,240
- against Oh Sang Min, - What's happening?

263
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,200
but he was found at the airport departure gate this morning.

264
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,720
He planned to leave the country while he was being investigated...

265
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
as the prosecution declined the request for his arrest warrant...

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
and insisted that he wouldn't flee.

267
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,960
So many people are questioning if there was any external pressure.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,840
Also, more marijuana...

269
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
was found in his suitcase,

270
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,120
which means that his statement about how he confused...

271
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,400
marijuana with tobacco is also false.

272
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,720
In addition, the phone conversation between him and his friend...

273
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,320
has gone viral on social media,

274
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,560
disproving...

275
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,760
the prosecution's statement about regretting his conduct.

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,640
Many are questioning whether it's because...

277
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,280
- he's a corporate heir... - What kind of jerk did this?

278
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,440
Whose ruse is this?

279
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,160
- The prosecution denied everything, - There he comes.

280
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,360
- How do you feel now? - but it has accepted...

281
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,160
- Where did you get the marijuana? - the police's request,

282
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,760
and the court has issued an arrest warrant against him.

283
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,360
The police have launched an investigation...

284
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,920
to find the person who first disseminated the video clip,

285
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,840
which was the main reason for the arrest warrant to be issued.

286
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
Meanwhile, some netizens...

287
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,080
are speculating that it could be...

288
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,920
the same person who disseminated...

289
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,440
the photos which proved Woo Byung Sik was alive.

290
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,680
How much do you want?

291
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,400
You punk.

292
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Let's go.

293
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,240
Sip... Sip Gyeon.

294
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,920
I just realized once again...

295
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,080
that this is such a nice country to live in.

They are generous to minors...

297
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
and conglomerates.

298
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,200
Marijuana...

299
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Where could he have hidden it?

300
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,400
What a punk.

301
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,000
By the way, who did such a wonderful deed?

302
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,080
Did Mr. Oh do it?

Mom, I want to live with you. Mom!

308
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I'm scared to live at Dad's house.

309
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,200
My brother scares me too.

310
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,480
Even his mom scares me.

311
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
Mom.

312
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
You see this, right?

313
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,360
I'm no longer your mom.

314
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,040
Mom...

315
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Mom...

316
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,920
You even put your life on the line...

just to send your son to a rich family.

Both you and I...

319
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,280
are in an utter mess now.

320

(My son did not suffer from depression.)

321
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,120
Hello, Doctor. This is Kyung Soo's mom.

322
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,720
There's something I must tell you.

323
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,720
I'll stop by your office.

are saying that we should reconsider the decision to sell it.

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,920
The numbers have gone up since he took the position,

333
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,440
and we've rarely lost any clients.

334
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,160
Gosh, those old jerks on the board...

335
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,440
Go ahead, and sell it immediately.

336
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,920
And get an article out to blame Man Soo for doing it.

337
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,240
After a few days, we'll announce his resignation.

338
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,960
How's the construction coming along for the shopping complex?

339
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,040
That's... It's still put on pause.

340
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,560
The civic groups and victim families are strongly against it.

341
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,000
Also, Congressman Kim Young Seok is maintaining a firm stance on it.

342
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,040
Goodness. Those idiots are driving me crazy.

343
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,280
We must tackle it head on to sort out the situation now.

344
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,520
I'll build the biggest shopping complex in Asia...

345
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,240
to show the whole world that I still have the power.

346
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,360
Resume the construction immediately.

347
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
Yes, sir. I'll instruct them to do so.

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Who is this boy?

349
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,120
(Joon's mom)

350
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,760
This is Moo Gang's mom.

351
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,760
I'd like to talk to you about something. Let's meet.

352
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,360
Why did you want to see me?

353
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Moo Gang lost his memory due to an accident.

354
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,760
He was in an accident?

355
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,320
He was held hostage at a shopping mall a while ago...

356
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,040
and nearly died.

357
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,080
Then...

358
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,680
the detective I saw on the news was...

359
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,160
Yes, that's right.

360
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,640
He managed to survive,

361
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,440
but he doesn't remember anything that happened before the accident.

362
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,560
He doesn't even recognize...

363
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,440
his own mother, me.

364
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,320
I had no idea.

365
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,560
You know why Moo Gang became a detective, right?

366
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,160
He quit his stable job in the US and joined the police force here...

367
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,040
to work as a detective because of you.

368
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,840
Because you said those useless things to him...

369
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,240
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,480
I don't want you to show up before him ever again.

371
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,160
Even if Moo Gang visits you,

372
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,000
please don't say anything to him.

373
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,040
Okay.

374
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,480
All right.

375
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Then I'll trust you...

376
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,480
and get going now.

377
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,880
(Site for the biggest shopping complex in Asia)

378
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,360
My goodness.

379
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,600
- What? - Wait, just a minute. Hold it!

380
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,800
- What's that? - Gosh, iron bars are buried.

381
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,240
Move it up.

382
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,720
- Doctor. - A cup of Americano, please.

383
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Doctor.

384
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,880
- Please hear me out. - Why is she supposed to die?

385
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,000
Is she ill?

386
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,160
Why do you want to know?

387
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,600
We're not allowed to pity humans no matter what.

388
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,160
Have you forgotten about that?

389
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,960
Why am I always like this?

390
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,200
I keep acting like a human.

391
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,640
My dream is to become a ruthless...

392
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,800
and heartless Grim Reaper like Black.

393
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Do you want to be like 444?

394
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,400
Of course. He's so cool and unsentimental.

395
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,960
He's intelligent too. I respect him a lot.

396
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
I mean, I did.

397
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,320
You did?

398
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,640
He has completely changed ever since...

399
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,880
he occupied Han Moo Gang's body.

400
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,200
What do you mean you didn't see anything?

401
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,800
Kyung Soo died so unfairly.

402
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
- Just a moment, please. - What?

403
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,120
I really can't say anything about...

404
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,520
Where have you guys been these last few days?

405
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,200
I looked everywhere for you two.

406
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,600
You tried to find us?

407
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,200
You used to always tell us to get lost.

408
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,760
What has gotten into you?

409
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,880
- We have a bit of a problem. - What?

410
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,160
What's up? What happened?

411
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Apparently, Han Moo Gang is not Joon.

412
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,240
- What? - In other words, this body...

413
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
is not that girl's first love.

414
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,800
Gosh, that's crazy. Really?

415
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,360
Because I was wearing the bracelet she gave to Joon...

416
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,640
I mean, Han Moo Gang was wearing it. That's why she was confused.

417
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,720
Besides, Han Moo Gang and Joon resembled each other a lot as kids.

418
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,200
They're half-brothers and share the same father.

419
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,720
My gosh, like what I see in TV dramas all the time?

420
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,520
Do you mean that kind of half-brothers?

421
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,560
She won't even want to help me if she finds out...

422
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,440
that Han Moo Gang is not Joon.

423
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,200
She goes on about Joon all day long!

424
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,680
Why are you getting so worked up over it?

425
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,560
- What? - Is the fact that he's not Joon...

426
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,600
that important to you?

427
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,560
Isn't that obvious?

428
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,160
If she finds out that I'm not Joon...

429
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,400
Why are you even asking that question?

430
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,120
We can't catch that loser without her eyes!

431
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,840
Is that all?

432
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,120
What are you talking about?

433
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,920
By the way, you made a big fuss about losing the capsule.

434
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Is it okay to leave Ha Ram alone like this?

435
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,880
Oh, right.

436
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,200
Goodness, she's annoying. She's so annoying!

437
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,640
He didn't seem annoyed, did he?

438
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,120
If he's really annoyed,

439
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,280
my last name would be Annoyed...

440
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,720
Where did you learn that boring pun?

441
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,240
- What about Lee 07? Park 07? - Goodness.

442
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,840
- Jo 07? - Stop it.

443
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,520
Namgoong 07 sounds good too.

444
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,160
- What about Sa 07? - That's enough.

445
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,400
You brat.

446
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,880
I knew it. Right?

447
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
Where did she go again? I told her to stay home.

448
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
What?

449
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,760
When did she take this?

450
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,480
Is it supposed to be my face?

451
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,080
"My face"?

452
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,040
This isn't my face.

453
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,080
Get a hold of yourself, 444.

454
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,440
This isn't me. It's Han Moo Gang, okay?

455
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
It's not me.

456
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,040
I wish I had a face too.

457
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
Has he not come to work yet?

458
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,760
He wasn't home either. Where did he go?

459
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,160
How can I help you?

460
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,920
- You must be here to see Moo Gang. - Yes.

461
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,960
- He hasn't come to work yet. - I see.

462
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,680
Shall I buy you a cup of coffee?

463
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,400
No, thank you. Goodbye.

464
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Well...

465
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,040
Gosh, she's pretty.

466
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,240
But something smells fishy, right?

467
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,640
There definitely is something fishy.

468
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,760
What's worse is the stink of your hair.

469
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,200
I'm surprised you came to work. What?

470
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,320
- Gwang Gyun, what happened? - Whatever.

471
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,760
The prosecution wants to forget the whole thing.

472
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,480
Things are going against them, so they're giving in now.

473
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,920
Those filthy jerks.

474
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,480
The one who filmed that video...

475
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,960
really is a lifesaver to me.

476
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,200
You did something wrong too, so behave yourself.

477
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,320
You should learn how to control your temper.

478
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,280
Are you a dog? Are you really a crazy dog?

479
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,720
Why do you keep biting people?

480
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,480
Well, I am a dog indeed,

481
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,000
but I'm a different kind of dog from those filthy animals.

482
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,720
I hope you're proud.

483
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,520
Get back to work.

484
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
Do you remember anyone particular?

485
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,880
No.

486
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,880
Hey, who is that?

487
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,640
It's for the assault case of the bar hostess. She's a testifier.

488
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,080
Don't even look at anything involved in that case! We'll deal with it.

489
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,560
You should just go behave yourself or sleep out in the open.

490
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,880
All right.

491
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,640
So is this the report on Han Jin Sook's case?

492
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,240
I think so.

493
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,720
My goodness.

494
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,560
"We assume Han Jin Sook threatened Woo Byung Sik that..."

495
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,560
"she will reveal his survival and his involvement in prostitution,"

496
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,160
"which resulted in Woo Byung Sik murdering Han Jin Sook."

497
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,640
Why did he become a detective? He should've become a novelist.

498
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,880
Gwang Gyun, stay out of it.

499
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,480
Fine.

500
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,520
I should've let them expel him. Gosh.

501
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,640
I must've been crazy.

502
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,920
She's taking a vacation in Japan.

503
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,800
She said she'd come back to work next week.

504
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,120
That's right.

505
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,440
She worked at Pumpkin Singer.

506
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,640
She must know something about Clara's death.

507
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,440
(List of Bar Hostesses in Moojin)

508
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,120
(Hwang Mi Ja, Pumpkin Singer)

509
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,240
Hello?

510
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,160
Hello? Who is this?

511
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,800
You silly. Why would you have your wages cut because of Gwang Gyun?

512
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,840
I can't understand you.

513
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,360
Why do you want to keep that nuisance in your team so badly?

514
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,920
He's not a nuisance. Please watch your words.

515
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,480
They released the jerk who tried to kill Moo Gang.

516
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,160
If Gwang Gyun hadn't bitten him, I would have.

517
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
He knows I have weak teeth, so he bit the prosecutor instead of me.

518
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,280
Look at you siding with your subordinate.

519
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm not siding with him. He's the most honest guy here.

520
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,960
- Move! Move! Gosh. - My goodness.

521
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,040
Is the woman done with the testimony?

522
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,520
Yes. She just left after giving her testimony.

523
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,320
Why did you bring such a troublesome case to our team?

524
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,960
You should've just left it with the teenage crime division.

525
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,800
Gosh, I can't agree with you on a single thing today.

526
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,000
How can you say that? That brat swung...

527
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,800
a shovel at Moo Gang. How could I let anyone else investigate it?

528
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,680
I should take Moo Gang's revenge.

529
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,440
Gosh, you said you wanted to fire him not so long ago.

530
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,400
Hey, you should be careful yourself.

531
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,280
You might not stop at losing hair but end up losing your job too.

532
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,120
You're dealing with Royeol. Even the prosecution doesn't mess with them.

533
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,600
Don't you know who is behind that group?

534
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,480
It's Senator Nam Joong Pyo, the strongest presidential candidate.

535
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,560
The presidential election is soon.

536
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,560
If they mess with my boys,

537
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,520
I would even investigate the Blue House.

538
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
How dare they?

539
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,920
A presidential candidate? Do you think he'd scare me?

540
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,760
Gosh, Captain Bong. How great.

541
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,200
You're right. If they mess with Moo Gang,

542
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,280
I'll destroy them even if it's the Blue House...

543
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,040
or the White House.

544
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,960
Your team is just helpless.

545
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,080
From head to tail,

546
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,480
you're all lunatics.

547
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,840
Lunatics?

548
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,120
Hey. Sir!

549
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,680
Gosh, Captain Bong is so cool.

550
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,200
My goodness!

551
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,560
Is it you again, Moo Gang?

552
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,480
Seriously.

553
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,440
But aren't you on sick leave?

554
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,680
I didn't know you were coming to work today.

555
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,440
- Did Kang Ha Ram come here? - Kang Ha Ram?

556
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,520
Oh, that girl? Gui Nam said he saw her in front of our office.

557
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,640
Really?

558
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,040
Gosh, what? What is it?

559
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,520
Take it back. We're not lunatics.

560
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,960
I've never heard that kind of insult.

561
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,640
What on earth... Moo Gang! What did you just do?

562
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,680
Short-legged Grandpa.

563
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,560
I called you a pervert before.

564
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
I take it back.

565
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,520
Gosh, that lunatic.

566
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,600
I'm really going to fire you!

567
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,240
Goodness.

568
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,880
Let's go down and check.

569
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,280
- My gosh. - What is this?

570
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
Stop the work!

571
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,920
- Stop the work! - Stop the work!

572
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,400
Turn off the engine!

573
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,760
- What? - What's going on?

574
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
What on earth is that?

575
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,680
What's that?

576
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,200
Yes, I'll be right there.

577
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
Doctor.

578
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,040
Doctor... Doctor.

579
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,800
Please tell them what you saw.

580
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,200
Why are you doing this to me?

581
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,840
I told you that I really didn't see anything.

582
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,880
Doctor. Please listen to me.

583
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,440
- My son, Kyung Soo... - I have to get back to work.

584
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,120
- Take care then. - Doctor.

585
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,680
What... What should we do? I don't think she has eaten in days.

586
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,760
She won't starve to death like that, right?

587
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
You're doing it again.

588
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,800
Can we ask Black to bring Ha Ram...

589
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,440
so that she can foresee how that woman dies?

590
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Then what?

591
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,000
You never know.

592
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,040
Ha Ram might save that woman's life.

593
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,360
What a great grim reaper you are.

594
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,480
How dare you forget your identity!

595
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,480
What... What's wrong with me?

596
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,280
Something's wrong with my body.

597
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,920
Gosh, what's going on with my body?

598
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,560
Where in the world is he? And why isn't he picking up all day?

599
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,640
Stop the construction of Royeol Complex Shopping Mall!

600
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
- Stop it! - Stop it!

601
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,280
We must not repeat the tragedy of Moojin Time Mart!

602
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,920
- We must not repeat! - We must not repeat!

603
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,240
- What? "Moojin Time Mart"? - Everyone!

604
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,400
Thanks to the sacrifice of Park Seung Chul's parents,

605
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,000
- That's Congressman Kim Young Seok. - we were able to find out that...

606
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Woo Byung Sik's death had actually been fabricated 20 years ago.

607
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,440
Who do you think helped Woo Byung Sik...

608
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,320
stay alive in secret for 20 years?

609
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,040
We must find out...

610
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,960
who helped Woo Byung Sik run away and supported him to stay alive.

611
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,440
And Royeol must also reveal the truth behind...

612
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,200
the Moojin Time Mart incident and why it ended up collapsing.

613
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,160
Until then, they must halt the construction!

614
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,400
- Halt the construction! - Halt the construction!

615
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,720
We wish to talk to Vice-chairman Oh Man Ho!

616
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,840
- We wish to talk to him! - We wish to talk to him!

617
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,560
- Let's go! - Let's go!

618
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,400
Seriously.

619
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,720
Joon.

620
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,440
You never manage to stay still, do you?

621
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,920
I'm pretty sure you were a beagle in your past life.

622
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Stand up.

623
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,320
Yes, what?

624
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,080
What?

625
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,120
Everyone! They found a skeleton!

626
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,560
- What? - What?

627
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,800
- What? - They found a button.

628
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,120
And it's the button from Moojin Middle School's uniform.

629
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,320
Could... Could it be my son, Hyun Soo?

630
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,080
Everyone, let's head to the hospital!

631
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,760
- Honey, we should go quickly. - Let's go.

632
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,840
It might be Seung Chul. We should go too.

633
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,640
"Seung Chul"?

634
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,240
That man's son?

635
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,640
You worked at a place called...

636
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,520
Pumpkin Singer in Moojin 20 years ago, didn't you?

637
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,800
Yes. So?

638
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,560
Was the manager close to anyone who seemed suspicious?

639
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,040
Or did you ever notice anything odd about her?

640
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,920
Clara? Why do you ask?

641
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,080
It's quite typical for women working in pubs.

642
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,960
They have a lot of guys around them and lots of enemies.

643
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,760
Did she leave with a guy when she left Moojin?

644
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,160
Or was there anything odd about her?

645
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,840
She didn't leave with a guy.

646
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,080
But she did flee with them in the middle of the night.

647
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
"Them"?

648
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,160
Yes. She fled with Jin Sook.

649
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,040
"Jin Sook"? Do you mean Han Jin Sook?

650
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,400
Are you saying Clara ran away with Han Jin Sook?

651
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,840
Yes, they ran away with all our money.

652
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,640
Those cunning brats.

653
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,920
I thought you kept in touch with Han Jin Sook in Seoul.

654
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,400
I heard you even gave her husband a job.

655
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,080
Yes, I met her by coincidence in Seoul.

656
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,920
Then did Han Jin Sook tell you anything about Clara?

657
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,280
She said they parted ways with each other as soon as they came to Seoul.

658
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,160
She said she hadn't kept in touch with her ever since.

659
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,040
Wait a minute. You said "Them".

660
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,240
Does that mean there was someone else other than Han Jin Sook?

661
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
That's right.

662
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,240
She was one of the newbies in the pub.

663
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,640
She always wore a neat uniform.

664
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,560
She was very pretty.

665
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,840
All the customers were practically drooling over her.

666
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,040
My gosh, what a bunch of animals.

667
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,440
Then what happened to her?

668
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,640
Did she not say anything about Han Jin Sook?

669
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,920
They also parted ways when they came to Seoul.

670
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,200
So they also hadn't met each other ever since.

671
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,960
Then do you remember her name?

672
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,680
Her name? What was her name again?

673
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
It was a very common name.

674
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,280
Sun... Sun Hee.

675
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,320
Sun Young. It... It was Kim Sun Young.

676
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,000
Yes, that's right.

677
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,480
- Kim Sun Young? - Yes.

678
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,480
Kim Sun Young.

679
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,920
Good thinking, Sun Young.

680
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,480
Are you telling me that you saw that video?

681
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,760
Moo Gang... Moo Gang had it.

682
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,800
So I thought he kept it in the storage room.

683
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,920
Come here.

684
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,120
Should we start all over again?

685
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,920
We couldn't find anything else there other than...

686
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
the videotape where you were taking your clothes off!

687
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,240
He...

688
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,640
He probably hid it somewhere else.

689
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,800
I'll... I'll find it for you.

690
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,040
Moo Gang lost his memory,

691
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,760
so he won't be able to reveal it to anyone anyway.

692
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,800
I'll naturally approach him,

693
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,320
and I'll get it back for you.

694
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,800
I also don't want that videotape out in the open...

695
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,760
as much as you guys.

696
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,960
You know that.

697
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,040
If you try to do anything funny,

698
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,440
I'm going to cut off all your arms and legs. Do you understand?

699
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,680
(Student Record, Moojin Girlsâ€™ Middle School)

700
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,200
- Excuse me. - Yes?

701
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,160
- Why is there a ripped page? - There's a ripped page? What?

702
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,280
- There's a missing page here. - That can't be.

703
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,440
The last detective who came here also asked me about that page.

704
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,640
What? What detective?

705
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,680
A handsome detective came and asked me...

706
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,400
to show him the student record of 1997.

707
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,200
He also asked about the same missing page.

708
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,000
By any chance, was he looking for a student named Kim Sun Young?

709
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,480
Yes, it was Kim Sun Young.

710
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,280
Do you remember who that detective was?

711
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,880
Well, I think I got his name card.

712
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,720
Just a second. I wonder if I threw it away.

713
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,640
Oh, here it is.

714
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,320
Thank you.

715
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Moo Gang?

716
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,160
When did he come here?

717
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,400
Well, it was the day after the school's anniversary.

718
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,200
So it was September 20.

719
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
September 20?

720
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,600
September 20.

721
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,640
That's about a month before he got into an accident.

722
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,280
What in the world was he trying to find out?

723
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,040
The doctor's here!

724
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
- Come on! - Let's go.

725
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,440
It's going to take a few days for the DNA results to come out.

726
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,360
But we compared the dental records...

727
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,240
of the missing person with the skeleton's teeth.

728
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,240
And the skeleton that was found today...

729
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,320
at the construction site of Royeol Complex Shopping Mall...

730
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,120
turned out to be Jang Hyun Soo of Moojin Middle School.

731
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,400
- Hyun Soo... - My gosh.

732
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,280
- My goodness. Hyun Soo. - Hyun Soo.

733
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,520
Honey, what should we do?

734
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,840
My gosh. Hyun Soo. Hyun Soo.

735
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,480
What? What's wrong with me?

736
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,960
Why have I turned into someone else?

737
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,560
They must've finally found you.

738
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,160
What? What does that mean?

739
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,240
Congratulations on being found.

740
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,480
Jang Hyun Soo.

741
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,240
"Jang Hyun Soo"?

742
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,920
How you look right now is your true self.

743
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
What?

744
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,920
My goodness. Hyun Soo!

745
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,160
My gosh. Honey, what should we do?

746
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,640
What should we do? It was Hyun Soo.

747
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,000
- I guess it wasn't Seung Chul. - Our poor son, Hyun Soo.

748
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,520
Where are you going?

749
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,680
Since I'm at Moojin,

750
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,120
I should go say hello to Seung Chul's parents.

751
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,000
And I should give them this photo while I'm there.

752
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,160
Mr. Park. Ms. Kim.

753
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,640
Woo Byung Sik's also dead now.

754
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,440
So just forget about everything,

755
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,640
and live a happy life with Seung Chul in paradise.

What's this?

760
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,840
Kim Joon's here too?

761
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,320
Detective Han?

762
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,000
What? Do you know me?

763
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,560
No. I think I mistook you for someone else.

764
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,400
I'm sorry.

765
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
What was that?

766
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,360
I guess he really can't remember anything.

767
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,280
Joon.

768
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320

Nothing. Let's go.

773
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Okay.

774
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,720
I wonder if I misheard that.

775
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
But...

776
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,640
how did he know Joon was here...

777
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,800
when he can't even remember anything?

778
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,880
Hey, when does Moo Gang start coming to work again?

779
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,520
He's not coming until next week.

780
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,880
- Hey, Captain Bong. - Yes?

781
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,480
Did you ever give Moo Gang a case without letting me know?

782
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,440
- What? - Did you give him a case?

783
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,880
Why don't you try using your brain?

784
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,080
He's been acting crazy ever since he lost his memory.

785
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,840
Why would I give that kind of guy a case?

786
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,720
I'm talking about before that. I'm talking about before the accident.

787
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,880
I told you to try using your brain.

788
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,200
He threw up every time when he saw a corpse.

789
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,560
So why would I trust him with any kind of case at all? Gosh.

790
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,560
- My gosh. - You brat.

791
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,720
Why did you become a detective when you're not even apt for it?

792
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,960
Why are you making so many people suffer because of that?

793
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,000
You graduated from a prestigious university in the States,

794
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,800
and you used to be a successful accountant.

795
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,920
There was something I must do.

796
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,720
What would be that something he just had to do?

797
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,440
What were you investigating by yourself, Moo Gang?

798
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,640
We shouldn't have met back then.

799
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,080
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

800
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,080
I'm sorry, big brother.

801
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,880
Big brother?

802
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,720
Then was he Joon's younger brother?

803
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,680
I should've visited earlier.

804
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,520
But it turned out to be like this.

805
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,640
(Han Moo Chan)

806
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,600
You're still very handsome.

807
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,680
I'll come see you again.

808
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,720
He got stabbed in his stomach.

809
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,720
To the left.

810
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,880
You can go home now.

811
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,440
Shouldn't I stay for a few more days?

812
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,280
Why are you here again?

813
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,720
Well, my hand got seriously injured.

814
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,480
What is it this time?

815
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,920
Well... I'm here because of this.

816
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,440
A mosquito bit me.

817
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,040
What kind of detective gets beaten up so badly by a bunch of gangsters?

818
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,760
Does it hurt anywhere else?

819
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,560
Yes... Yes, it does.

820
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,600
Really? Where?

821
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,120
Here.

822
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,880
You got hit in the chest as well?

823
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,560
- Then let's take an X-ray... - No, no.

824
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,320
No, that's not what I meant.

825
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,600
My heart...

826
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,880
- is beating. - What?

827
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,000
My heart's beating like crazy.

828
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,240
Wait...

829
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,960
Right?

830
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,160
I shouldn't have met him back then.

831
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,480
If I treated him coldheartedly back then,

832
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,160
things wouldn't have come this far.

833
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,280
I have no other choice now.

834
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,680
Thank you for today, Joon.

835
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,480
Go home safely.

836
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,680
Stay home until I call you tomorrow. Okay?

837
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,240
Joon's the only person who cares about me.

838
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,600
You saw it, didn't you?

839
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,600
You saw a shadow on him, didn't you?

840
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,360
I'm talking about Hoon Seok's dad.

841
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,440
You saw something that day, didn't you?

842
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,720
I don't know.

843
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
No.

844
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,440
He can't die.

845
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,240
Do you still like that jerk even after getting beaten up by him?

846
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,680
I guess you can't last a day without a man.

847
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,360
You have no pride when it comes to men, do you?

848
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,360
Hoon Seok's sick.

849
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,280
That poor boy...

850
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,400
has leukemia.

851
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,040
What?

852
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,720
Thankfully, his marrow matches with his dad's,

853
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,200
so his dad agreed to donate it to him.

854
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,880
But I can't get a hold of his dad...

855
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,560
ever since he left home saying that he'll earn money for the surgery.

856
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,600
You saw the shadow, didn't you?

857
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,320
You know where and how...

858
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,120
- he's going to die, don't you? - Are you...

859
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,640
asking me to save that jerk?

860
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,760
If he dies, Hoon Seok will die as well.

861
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,840
Do you see this?

862
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,480
I almost died while trying save someone.

863
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,400
You don't care about what happens to me, do you?

864
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,640
You try so hard to save that boy when he's not even your real son.

865
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,240
But you don't even care whether your real daughter dies or not.

866
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,720
Do you love that jerk's love child that much?

867
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,600
If he used to pig out that much,

868
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,600
shouldn't he be healthy from all the food he's eaten?

869
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,760
Is he a protagonist in a tragic novel or what?

870
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,000
Why does it have to be leukemia out of all diseases?

871
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,320
Why am I your sister? We don't even share a single drop of blood.

872
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,800
All right, I shall at least watch how you'll die.

873
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,240
What's he doing?

874
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,120
Darn it. Taxi, taxi!

875
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,360
You spent all of your hard-earned money on gambling.

876
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,280
You can't even afford to pay for your son's surgery?

877
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,800
I'll do anything you need me to do, so please pay me up front.

878
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,920
I have no money.

879
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,000
Gosh. Don't be like that, please.

880
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,800
Please help me out here.

881
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,600
I can smash and tear down everything.

882
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,160
Not everyone can do this job. Gosh.

883
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,640
I said that I'll do anything. Please help me out.

884
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,200
My goodness.

885
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,280
(Sun Employment Agency)

886
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,120
Gosh, that startled me.

887
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,120
(Loser)

888
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,720
Hey, Joon.

889
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,280
Where are you now?

890
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,760
I told you not to go anywhere and stay home.

891
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,240
Where did you go at the crack of dawn?

892
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,040
What?

893
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,320
Where?

894
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,160
Have you found anything yet?

895
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,800
Oh, I was just about to call you. You came at the perfect time.

896
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,920
Here. Have a look at this.

897
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,440
A minute amount of arsenous acid was found in the teeth in the skull.

898
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,920
What's arsenous acid?

899
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,080
It's an arsenic compound...

900
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,520
that gets easily accumulated in the skin or bones,

901
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,560
so it can be found in the body even a few years after death.

902
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,360
In the past, it was used...

903
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,080
in things like preservatives, dyes, insecticides,

904
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,360
and so on,

905
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,200
but its harmful effects were confirmed in 1986,

906
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,440
so its production has been banned in the country ever since.

907
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,560
- 1986? - Yes.

908
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,120
Hang on a second.

909
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,240
Then it's been over 30 years since they stopped making...

910
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,720
arsenous acid or whatever it's called.

911
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,280
But the skeleton is from someone who died 20 years ago.

912
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,920
It doesn't add up.

913
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,800
I looked further into it and found out...

914
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,120
that a dye manufacturing factory got caught while using it illegally...

915
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,280
in 1996 and was shut down as a result.

916
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,400
I think that person...

917
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,560
was killed there.

918
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,080
Where's that factory?

919
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,240
- Moojin. - Moojin?

920
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,240
Yes, I prepared everything according to the plan.

921
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,280
We'll leave now.

922
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,920
I want to go too. Please take me. I can do a great job.

923
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,240
Gosh, you may get injured.

924
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,760
My son might die. I don't care whether I get injured or not.

925
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,080
All right, then. We're going to leave now, so follow me.

926
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,520
- Thank you. - Let's go, guys.

927
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,560
Get moving. Hurry up.

928
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
Let's go.

929
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,200
Hurry up.

930
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,640
Get in. Go on.

931
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,520
Get in, guys.

932
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,280
What's going on?

933
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,640
I see the shadow on that man too.

934
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,080
Who are all those people?

935
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,840
Where are they going?

936
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,600
- What should I do? - What are you going to do?

937
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,760
Joon.

938
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,640
Joon. You brought your car, right?

939
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
Follow me.

940
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,640
Everyone is expressing their condolences to commemorate...

941
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,160
the Moojin Time Mart collapse victim found after 20 years.

942
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,640
The President and other influential figures...

943
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,840
are visiting the mortuary in Moojin...

944
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,680
to console the bereaved.

945
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,480
I...

946
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,120
- I just... - Honey...

947
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,320
remembered everything.

948
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,080
Don't go.

949
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,960
Please don't go there.

950
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,840
Hey, Seung Chul.

951
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,640
The school bell rings

952
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,800
Our class is about to start

953
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,280
If we're late, we'll get in trouble

954
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,280
Let's go.

955
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,800
All right, Hyun Soo. Let's go together.

956
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,840
Don't... Don't go. Don't go there.

957
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,760
Okay, I won't go to the movies.

958
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,560
Seung Chul!

959
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,120
What's the matter with that kid?

960
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,000
It's nothing.

961
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,040
Hyun Soo.

962
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,440
Will you go to the movies tomorrow?

963
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,080
Of course. I've been dying to watch the movie.

964
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,280
Oh, no. We're late.

965
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,360
(Moojin Time Mart)

966
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,960
- Hey, come here! - Help!

967
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,680
What... What should we do now, Seung Chul?

968
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,280
I'm so stunned...

969
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,280
that I can't even feel the pain.

970
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,800
I guess the doctors...

971
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,680
will stitch them up.

972
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,880
By the way,

973
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,760
my mom will be...

974
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,640
so upset if she sees this.

975
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,400
Will we die like this, Seung Chul?

976
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,960
What are you talking about?

977
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,960
I'm sure that the adults will come and rescue us.

978
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,800
Don't move. Try to stay still.

979
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,160
My mom wanted me to eat breakfast,

980
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,360
so she followed me with a bowl of rice in her hand,

981
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,960
but I threw a tantrum at her...

982
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,920
and said that I don't want to eat it.

983
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,120
Just make sure you eat...

984
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,800
breakfast every day starting tomorrow.

985
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,080
I'll be able to do that, right?

986
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,720
No!

987
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,800
What happened?

988
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,800
I didn't think that I used to be a human.

989
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,400
I thought... I thought that I was born as the Grim Reaper.

990
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,920
The truth is...

991
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,280
that we all used to be humans.

992
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,640
All of us who believe that they were born as Grim Reapers...

993
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,360
used to be humans just like those who took their own lives.

994
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,200
Then... What are we?

995
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,240
We didn't take our own lives. Then what are we?

996
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,160
Exactly what are we?

997
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,960
Missing people.

998
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,240
Missing... Missing people?

999
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
That's right.

1000
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,880
We're not in the human form like those who took their own lives...

1001
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,040
because our bodies have gone missing.

1002
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,640
Our bodies...

1003
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,280
are all deeply buried somewhere.

1004
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,760
At the very moment...

1005
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,640
when a missing body...

1006
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
is discovered by someone,

1007
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,560
they will find their true self again just like you did now.

1008
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,720
You also regain all of your lost memories...

1009
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,720
as well.

1010
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,680
My number is 416.

1011
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,840
Then is it because...

1012
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,880
That's right.

1013
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,440
You died on that date.

1014
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,640
The number of everyone who went missing...

1015
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,800
is the date of their death.

1016
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,240
Mom.

1017
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Dad.

1018
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,800
Why have you gotten so old?

1019
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,120
Why?

1020
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,680
I'm sorry.

1021
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,920
A dye manufacturing factory got caught while using it illegally...

1022
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,240
in 1996 and was shut down as a result.

1023
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,960
I think that person was killed there.

1024
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,720
Clara.

1025
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,080
She didn't run away from me.

1026
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,880
She was murdered here.

1027
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,360
(Welcome to the City of Moojin)

1028
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,360
Moojin?

1029
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,920
Why are we going to Moojin?

1030
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,280
Han Moo Gang.

1031
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,680
He knew that Sun Young was involved in Clara's death.

1032
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,560
He might even know...

1033
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,240
who killed Clara.

1034
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,080
Isn't that Moo Gang?

1035
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,280
Han Moo Gang.

1036
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,480
Han Moo Gang!

1037
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,160
What is it?

1038
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,640
What do you know, you punk?

1039
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,320
- What's wrong? - Try to remember. Remember it!

1040
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,480
- What were you trying to find out? - Let go. Have you lost your mind?

1041
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,040
Remember it now, you brat. Recall who killed this woman.

1042
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,440
(Medical Records)

1043
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,480
Hey, what are you doing?

1044
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,600
What?

1045
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,840
How could 419 have done that?

1046
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,720
Grim Reapers can't have a real human's face.

1047
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,440
So 419...

1048
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,040
was also a missing person like me.

1049
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,000
As his skeletons were found,

1050
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,880
he has found his true self.

1051
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,880
At the site where his skeletons were found,

1052
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,080
the real Han Moo Gang was present.

1053
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,240
Then did he die on April 19?

1054
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,160
- Did he go to paradise? - No, he was punished for his sins.

1055
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,760
His sins were too much.

1056
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,800
Those who play with children are never forgiven by him.

1057
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,360
What about me?

1058
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,720
Where will I go?

1059
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,880
Of course you'll go to paradise.

1060
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,400
All of your friends went to paradise.

1061
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,520
Then does that mean 444...

1062
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,960
was also a human being?

1063
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,680
Was he also a missing person like me?

1064
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,160
Yes.

1065
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:37,359
- Repeal. - Repeal.

1066
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,240
Stop the act.

1067
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,240
- Stop the act. - Stop the act.

1068
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,720
Repeal.

1069
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,279
- Repeal. - Repeal.

1070
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,240
- Those punks. - Let's go.

1071
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,399
- Get them. - Yes, sir!

1072
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,439
You punks!

1073
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,120
What should I do?

1074
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,279
- Let go of her! - What are you?

1075
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,080
Stop it!

1076
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,720
Ha Ram. Ha Ram!

1077
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,880
Hey. Hey!

1078
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,720
Hey, Han Moo Gang!

1079
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,520
Ha Ram. Ha Ram!

1080
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,280
Where would 444 be buried?

1081
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,720
I'm not sure either.

1082
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,880
He must find out himself...

1083
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,160
from now on.

1084
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,480
(Black)

1085
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,440
Are you telling me to spare him?

1086
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,560
If he dies, Hoon Seok will die as well.

1087
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,000
I must find proof that he tried to kill me.

1088
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,240
I think that's where he was murdered.

1089
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,560
Where is that factory?

1090
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,480
What were you investigating all alone, Moo Gang?

1091
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,640
Joon.

1092
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,680
What a great grim reaper you are. How dare you forget your identity!

1093
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,320
- What were you trying to find out? - Let go. Have you lost your mind?

1094
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,440
I wish I had a face too.
