1
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,600
(20 years ago)

2
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
(Final Episode)

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
Wang Young Choon will kill me?

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,240
He'll kill me because I was investigating his wife's case.

5
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,400
Where has he gone to?

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,960
I saw him walking into the mountains.

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,560
Joon?

8
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,400
Joon, are you okay?

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,880
What happened to you?

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
- Why did he... - Mr. Kang.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,160
Mr. Kang.

12
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,440
Joon!

13
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,759
Joon!

14
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,600
Which scumbag did this?

15
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Ha Ram.

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
Ha Ram. Wake up, will you?

17
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,480
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

18
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,080
Ha Ram. Wake up. Please.

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,560
Ha Ram.

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
It was Ha Ram who shot me in the head.

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
Joon, I'm sorry.

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,640
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done these things.

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
It's me, Ha Ram. I am Kang Ha Ram.

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120
Don't you remember me? It's me, Ha Ram.

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
Is this why my head hurt so much when we first met?

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,280
Did you...

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,079
find the tape?

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,360
I can tell from his face that he couldn't find it.

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,760
Leave me alone.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,320
You said you met the grim reaper who was in charge of Young Choon.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Every Grim Reaper knows about this.

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,360
The Death Squad will be here any minute.

33
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,560
You have to get your corpse out first.

34
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,840
You will lose your corpse again if you're forced to come out...

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
because your memory will be gone.

36
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,040
It's not allowed for you to come to this world by yourself.

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,840
Only a human can help you with this.

38
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,400
Gosh. Why don't you take that laptop...

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,120
and report this to the police?

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,079
Then the police will arrest Han Moo Gang's mother...

41
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,000
and take your corpse out.

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
The one who shot me...

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,920
was Kang Ha Ram.

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,240
Sorry?

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,079
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,840
Of all places, I hid myself in a glass factory.

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,960
To Ha Ram's eyes, my reflection in the glass...

48
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,600
must have been seen as the shadow that followed her dad.

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
Oh, my goodness.

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,320
So she shot you to save her dad?

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,480
Where did he go? He even left his phone at the hospital.

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
What?

53
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,920
Is he home?

54
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,440
Detective Han. Detective Han.

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,200
Isn't he home?

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,400
What happened? Where did you go without telling the hospital staff?

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
How's your head? Are you okay?

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,440
It's not because you're Joon.

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,800
I just like who you are.

60
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,760
The one I like...

61
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
is you, Han Moo Gang.

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,080
Stay away from my daughter, you darn Grim Reaper.

63
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Get lost.

64
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
Don't you realize how obnoxious you are?

65
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,120
Because of your obnoxious eyes...

66
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,880
Detective Han.

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,000
Why did he have to approach your father?

68
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
Leave.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,320
Don't you ever come see me again. Get lost.

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Go away.

71
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
Ha Ram.

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
Why are you here?

73
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,640
How long have you been like this?

74
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,600
Did something happen?

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,600
You should have killed me then.

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,840
Even when I said no,

77
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,760
you should have killed me.

78
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
I'm such a monster.

79
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
Why didn't you just kill me?

80
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Did Detective Han say something to you?

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,080
What did he say to you to make you like this? Tell me.

83
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,520
How could he be not prosecuted?

84
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,320
He said it himself that he raped someone.

85
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,200
He said he killed people and ordered people to be killed.

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,400
He said it in front of the whole country.

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,840
Goodness. I didn't play the rapist role...

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
for this.

89
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,400
I feel ashamed.

90
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,760
There must be something behind him when everyone's against him.

91
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
We must find the tape.

92
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,720
Our only hope for now is Lee Byeong Tae. We have to find him.

93
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
Yes, sir. I'll start from Moojin.

94
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,440
- Okay, go for it. - Let's go.

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,159
Hello, this is...

96
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,000
Han Moo Gang. Where are you now?

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
Yes. I'll bring over a laptop.

98
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,360
It has all the evidence of the murder cases. Wait for me.

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,480
Did you do that?

100
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,600
Did you call my daughter a monster?

101
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,320
It's true. Isn't it?

102
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
What?

103
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,360
Do you even know how she is?

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,400
Do you know how much Ha Ram is suffering now?

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,880
You told me to get lost!

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,920
I had to be mean like that for her to leave me alone.

107
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,400
I'll get lost as you wish. So just wait, and see.

108
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
Do you even know how she is?

109
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,680
Do you know how much Ha Ram is suffering now?

110
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,240
I don't care.

111
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,159
I won't mind.

112
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,120
I will not care.

113
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,160
(Hi, it's mom. I'll be home soon. Have some food when you get up.)

114
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
(Don't forget to take the medicine.)

115
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,880
Do you know how obnoxious you are?

116
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,720
Your obnoxious eyes made me...

117
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
Detective Han.

118
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,559
Get lost now. Don't you ever come see me again. Leave.

119
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,560
Go away.

120
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,560
Who does he think he is to tell me that I'm a monster?

121
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,760
He's the obnoxious one.

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,600
He once said...

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
my eyes are dogs' eyes.

124
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,760
Now, he calls my eyes obnoxious.

125
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,160
What are you doing?

126
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,800
Let go of my hand. I hate my eyes too.

127
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,120
Let go of me.

128
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,280
Let go of me!

129
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,080
Please forget about the mean things I said to you.

131
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,800
Could you please forgive me and stay by Ha Ram's side?

132
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
What?

133
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,880
I don't think she can stand this.

134
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
She needs you.

135
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
If you leave her, that poor thing...

136
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,040
will become a mess.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,560
She will have a much more unfortunate life than mine.

138
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,800
So please stay by her side as a human.

139
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,760
Could you be next to her until the end of her life?

140
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,160
Please, I beg you.

141
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,040
Please forgive me. I'm really sorry. Please.

142
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,960
I beg you.

143
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
What? Haven't you given them that yet?

144
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
You will lose all your memories...

145
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,520
if the Death Squad comes to rip out your soul.

146
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,840
Go give it to them now. Hurry.

147
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,680
If the police find out about my death from this laptop,

148
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,280
Ha Ram will get to know the truth behind all.

149
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,440
She will also realize that it was me whom she shot, not the shadow.

150
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,040
Of course, she will. The police will start the investigation.

151
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,720
They'll also conduct an inspection of the scenes too.

152
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,200
Ha Ram won't be charged for shooting you anyway.

153
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,200
It was when she was young and it was unintentional. She won't be charged.

154
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,920
It's not about that.

155
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
If she finds out that she shot me,

156
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,520
she'll find out that I died because of her.

157
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Will Ha Ram...

158
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,960
be able to bear the truth?

159
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
So what?

160
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,320
You aren't going to cover all this, are you?

161
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,680
Have you lost your mind?

162
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
Don't you think it's unfair?

163
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,160
Don't you feel upset that you were killed...

164
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,120
for your heart to be cut out and thrown into the sea...

165
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,360
for over 20 years?

166
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,040
Yes, it's unfair.

167
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,040
It's driving me mad.

168
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,960
I pity myself so much that it's driving me mad.

169
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,520
If I hadn't died like that,

170
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,760
I would be living a normal life like other humans.

171
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,240
I was only 13.

172
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,840
It's unfair.

173
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,160
It's too much for me.

174
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,880
What are you doing?

175
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,160
I'm going to live as a human.

176
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,760
If you two keep quiet about this, I can live in this human body forever.

177
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm sure Ha Ram won't find out.

178
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,600
Are you sure you don't want to reveal the truth about your death?

179
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,320
It must be my destiny since I'm in the body of Han Moo Gang.

180
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,000
I think I got another chance to live because I died so unfairly.

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,760
It could only be another chance to reveal the truth of your death...

182
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,440
and not another chance to live as a human.

183
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,800
Shut it. Get lost if you're here to say that.

184
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,120
I have the right to be happy too.

185
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,200
I'll just live as Han Moo Gang.

186
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,160
I'll live a happy life with Ha Ram. Go away now.

187
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,080
There's somewhere you must go with me.

188
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
Let's go.

189
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,160
Whatever you're about to hear, you must hear it.

190
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,400
Is this true?

191
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,400
Is this really the brain scan copy of Detective Han?

192
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, it got in there during the hostage incident at the mall.

193
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,920
Tell her exactly what you told me.

194
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,920
Don't worry about it too much since there is a man...

195
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,520
who lived until 80 with a bullet in his brain.

196
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,160
But since the bullet keeps pressing the brain nerves,

197
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,640
there are some side effects.

198
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,560
For instance, he might be aggressive all of sudden.

199
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,400
He could even curse sometimes.

200
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,000
But it's just the brain nerves that have nothing to do...

201
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,920
with his own intentions.

202
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,000
He won't even remember those actions and curses...

203
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,480
he has done in the past.

204
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,800
No wonder.

205
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,680
As you know,

206
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,120
I do act strangely sometimes.

207
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,040
Cursing at people...

208
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,560
like how it would be so easy to sell your eyes.

209
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,000
And I don't remember how we met last night at all.

210
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,160
I feel like I just had a migraine.

211
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,880
You don't remember we met last night?

212
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,960
No.

213
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,720
I was shocked to hear about it from your mother.

214
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,599
I can't believe I said those things.

215
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,240
I'm sorry.

216
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,200
Ha Ram.

217
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,560
To me, your eyes...

218
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,440
are the most precious jewels in this world.

219
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,440
I can't stand it if your body gets hurt.

220
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,120
So please take good care of it, will you?

221
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,080
What are you going to do with that bullet in the brain then?

222
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,320
I'll get brain surgery in the US.

223
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,000
Surgery?

224
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,720
Yes. They say it's a simple surgery.

225
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,080
The most renowned neurosurgeon in the US will do it.

226
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,120
He's operated on five patients with a bullet in their heads,

227
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,360
and he succeeded in all surgeries.

228
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,880
That's a relief.

229
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,040
Let me come with you.

230
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,800
What?

231
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
Well...

232
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,760
I'm going there with my mom.

233
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,520
Right.

234
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,160
When are you going there?

235
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Soon.

236
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,160
She'll be your sister from now on.

237
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,040
She's my friend's daughter. She'll be living with us now.

238
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,520
Nice to meet you, Joon. I'm Kim Sun Young.

239
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,760
Why is this happening?

240
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
Why is my heart pounding so hard?

241
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,720
Yoon Soo Wan.

242
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,600
The reason for Moo Gang's heart to start pounding when he saw you...

243
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
was me.

244
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,440
It's been a while...

245
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,760
since you looked at me like that.

246
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,040
When are you going to the US?

247
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,040
Kim Young Seok has been released. How can I go there now?

248
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,440
I'm going to have an interview with the press.

249
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,720
If I reveal my face and tell them everything he's done,

250
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
the prosecution won't have a choice.

251
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,960
They'll have to reinvestigate.

252
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Soo Wan.

253
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
What about your life then?

254
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,160
It doesn't matter.

255
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,800
Because I've been hiding like a coward...

256
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,040
It matters to me.

257
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
I have an idea.

258
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,360
I'll take care of everything.

259
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,880
Trust me, and leave.

260
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,280
Please.

261
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
And...

262
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,520
I need to ask you a favor.

263
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,360
This beef tripe soup still smells the same.

264
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,480
It reminds me of the old days.

265
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,880
You...

266
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,800
You're my dear Sun Young.

267
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Hi.

268
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,280
I tried so hard to find you.

269
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,240
I tried so hard,

270
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,600
but after I saw the news, I felt too bad that I couldn't do it anymore.

271
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,120
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have sent you there.

272
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,200
I shouldn't have sent you to her. I'm sorry.

273
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,680
Why are you sorry to me?

274
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,520
You took me in and raised me.

275
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,160
I'm sorry...

276
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,160
for what grown-ups did to you.

277
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm sorry, Sun Young.

278
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,760
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,960
If you're really sorry,

280
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,440
support me from now on.

281
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,640
I'm moving to the US.

282
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,480
Come with me.

283
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,960
What?

284
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm going to work at a hospital there.

285
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,400
That hospital gets a lot of patients,

286
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,960
so I'll be very busy.

287
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,280
Then I won't be able to eat well,

288
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,600
and I can't keep my house clean.

289
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,720
You know I'm bad at many things, right?

290
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,000
Once,

291
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,200
I boiled your silk blouse with other laundries, and you scolded me.

292
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,720
Do you remember it?

293
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,040
So...

294
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,800
please come with me.

295
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
(Park Seung Chul)

296
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,880
(Park Seung Chul)

297
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
(Han Moo Chan)

298
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,680
(Han Moo Chan)

299
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,480
(Park Seung Chul)

300
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,040
Seung Chul, I'm sorry...

301
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,640
for putting you back in your right place so late.

302
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,320
What? Where is my laptop?

303
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,640
I can't lose it.

304
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,720
Hey, Loser.

305
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,880
What... What are you doing?

306
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,560
I didn't do anything wrong.

307
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,320
My dad is the one who did it all. I really don't know anything.

308
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,240
Of course not. You wouldn't know anything.

309
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,400
Because you're not Leo, but my idiotic partner.

310
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,280
Will you get out of his body yourself, or should I pull you out?

311
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,320
Fine.

312
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,320
1, 2...

313
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,000
All right. I'm coming out.

314
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm coming out.

315
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,400
I'm sorry.

316
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,880
444, forgive me.

317
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,080
You've been...

318
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,000
But how did you know I was inside Leo's body?

319
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What?

320
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,600
Your laptop.

321
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,080
What? That idiot.

322
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,960
Did he get inside Leo's body?

323
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,160
You took my laptop?

324
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
How?

325
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,400
Min Jae Hoon.

326
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,640
Min Jae Hoon betrayed me, didn't he?

327
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,080
Gosh. I trusted him, showed him the laptop,

328
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,760
and asked him for advice.

329
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,200
I have to go talk to him right now.

330
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
Hey, stop. Sit down.

331
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,040
Don't try to pull any tricks, you punk.

332
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,560
You've been messing with me all this time?

333
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,040
It's actually your fault!

334
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,760
Why did you send me alone?

335
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
What?

336
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,120
Goodness. 444, that jerk.

337
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,040
I know he's playing a trick to get a new partner.

338
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,640
Please don't be a child.

339
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,120
What?

340
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,720
Wait.

341
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,360
Why is Detective Han here?

342
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
What?

343
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,960
He acted like he owns the world,

344
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,360
and he's dead just like me after all.

345
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,600
Gosh. Mi Sook, that witch.

346
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,840
How could she cheat on me with Leo?

347
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
All right.

348
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,440
You should pay for what you did too.

349
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,480
Who cares? I'm dead anyway.

350
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,560
I'm not scared of anything.

351
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,520
All right. Even if I end up falling into the fiery pit,

352
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,720
I want to have a nice life for once.

353
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,320
Darn it. Whatever.

354
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,120
Leo!

355
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,080
Leo. Leo!

356
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,240
Leo. Gosh, where is he?

357
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,840
Where did he go?

358
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,400
If Moo Gang finds out, everything will be over.

359
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,360
So please convince him not to investigate his brother's case!

360
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,400
Why are you doing this to me?

361
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,040
Why?

362
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,400
- Who is he? - Don't you know why?

363
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,880
It's something we did together. We did it together!

364
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,240
I threw away the empty capsule and tried to run away,

365
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,480
but I passed out because of the drugs.

366
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,120
According to Leo's manager,

367
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,200
Doctor Min Jae Hoon took me to the hospital and treated me.

368
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,760
Since then, we've been helping each other out.

369
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,360
Help out each other? She tried to kill you.

370
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,160
What? What are you talking about?

371
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,400
She hasn't been caught for 100 years, but you caught her.

372
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,040
If she kills Leo and you come out,

373
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,000
you wouldn't remember what you saw in Leo's body.

374
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,520
I knew it.

375
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,560
I thought I was delusional because of the drugs.

376
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,640
Gosh, I thanked her when she tried to kill me.

377
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,120
That cunning old hag.

378
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,720
She can't do this to me. I'll go talk to her right now.

379
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,080
You're not going anywhere.

380
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,600
She's been on the run for 100 years. Do you think I just let her go?

381
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,960
Why didn't you answer your phone? We have a big problem.

382
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,600
Moo Gang...

383
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,040
found out everything.

384
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,600
Jae Hoon.

385
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Jae Hoon...

386
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,360
You... You killed that doctor?

387
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,600
You said you promised to let her go if she got you the laptop.

388
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,480
Yes, I did promise her. But I never said I'd keep it.

389
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,400
Right. But how did you manage to fool everyone that you're Leo?

390
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,760
You didn't even speak in dialect.

391
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,840
I told you before. I wanted to be an actor.

392
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,760
That's why I learned not to speak in dialect.

393
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,360
444. Please give me some time.

394
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,040
I worked as an extra all my life.

395
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,200
I failed over 100 auditions because I'm not handsome.

396
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
For the first time,

397
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,880
I got to act, and I've been so happy.

398
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,560
So please wait until this drama ends.

399
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,720
Could you turn a blind eye just until then?

400
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
You're a natural-born actor...

401
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,320
who's good enough to fool me.

402
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,360
I'm sorry the world didn't recognize your ability.

403
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,080
Gosh. If you can't do that,

404
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,360
please let me at least see my mom and sister one last time.

405
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,560
I was scared you might find me,

406
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
so I couldn't even go near them.

407
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
Just live as a human...

408
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
- What? - as long as you want.

409
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Just live as a human.

410
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,320
But...

411
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,920
under one condition.

412
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,920
Did you say I'll be inheriting Royeol Electronics?

413
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,480
But I signed a paper that says I relinquish my inheritance.

414
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,200
It was signed illegally, so it was nullified.

415
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,240
As you know, Royeol Electronics...

416
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,280
is the biggest shareholder of Royeol.

417
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,640
You'll be given the right to make decisions for the entire company.

418
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,360
Besides, Mr. Oh Man Ho is under investigation...

419
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,520
for bribery although it's without physical restraint.

420
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,080
That means I have the authority to make every decision...

421
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,040
about the management of the company, right?

422
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,160
Please arrange a press conference.

423
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,240
Are you really going to keep it a secret?

424
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,280
I'm asking if you can live as a human...

425
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,040
without punishing those who killed you.

426
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,280
I don't want to hurt Ha Ram again.

427
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,560
Her life has been hard enough already.

428
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,600
I'll forget about everything...

429
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,640
and protect her by her side.

430
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,320
You may forget about Moo Gang's mother,

431
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,160
but what about Kim Young Seok?

432
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,520
If you don't do anything, don't you think...

433
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,680
Ha Ram may be in danger later?

434
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
Probably.

435
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,120
Wait. You want me to resign?

436
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,000
How could you say that?

437
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,880
You need to step in and make me the next president...

438
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,160
if you want everyone to be safe.

439
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,320
His approval rating was about 30 percent, but it plunged to 5.

440
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,480
The experts think Kim Young Seok may resign from his post himself.

441
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,600
It has been revealed that Leo, the top star, is the son of...

442
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,200
Kim Young Seok, who was under suspicion of...

443
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,040
sexual assault against minors, murder, and abetting murders.

444
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,920
The public sentiment is now against him.

445
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,120
People are now boycotting the drama Leo will star in...

446
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,640
which will air soon...

447
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,840
Hello?

448
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,760
Hi, Woo Sik. It's Dad.

449
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,840
I'm sorry about all this.

450
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,920
Is it Kim Young Seok?

451
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,320
I'll send a car to you now.

452
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,760
Meet me at our house in Moojin.

453
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,239
Darn it. Why isn't 444 answering his phone?

454
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,000
I thought you wouldn't forgive me forever,

455
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,040
but I found out that you wore this jacket that day...

456
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,000
and realized how you must've felt.

457
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,679
I will remember...

458
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,000
your feelings of that day.

459
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,960
As of today, we're canceling all of our plans to build...

460
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,720
the Royeol Complex Shopping Mall.

461
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,760
Instead, we'll make a memorial park in this area...

462
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,400
for the victims of the Moojin Time Mart collapse...

463
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,160
so everyone can remember it...

464
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,480
and prevent the same thing from happening.

465
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,440
Moreover,

466
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,440
I will transfer all our family's management rights to a specialist.

467
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,200
From now on, Royeol...

468
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,680
- will no longer be a conglomerate. - I'm proud of him.

469
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,840
I'm going to be late. I should hurry.

470
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,760
Is no one here yet?

471
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,280
What about your mother and your teammates?

472
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,720
My mom went inside first,

473
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,560
and I said goodbye to my teammates at the station.

474
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,560
Call me as soon as you land.

475
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,280
Okay.

476
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,840
Goodbye.

477
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,920
Call me as soon as you land, okay?

478
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Ha Ram.

479
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,480
Mr. Oh.

480
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Has he gone inside already?

481
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,760
Yes, just now.

482
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,200
I guess I got here a bit too late.

483
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,720
His surgery will go well. Don't worry too much.

484
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,600
By the way, you look...

485
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,520
like a salesman today.

486
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,000
Today's officially my first day of work.

487
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,440
While we're on that subject...

488
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,560
- Here, take this. - What is it?

489
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,400
You promised to take out insurance.

490
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,000
I'll give you the honor of becoming my first client.

491
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,280
I saw the press conference.

492
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,920
I heard you're going to make a memorial park...

493
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,480
for the Moojin Time Mart incident.

494
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Well...

495
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,840
I'm going to make a walkway on the hill...

496
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,360
that's behind Moojin Elementary School.

497
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,560
There will be concerts and exhibitions at the park too.

498
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,600
- The hill that's behind our school? - Yes.

499
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,840
When will the construction start?

500
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,440
It starts tomorrow.

501
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,840
Oh, no. I should go get it as soon as possible.

502
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,880
Get what?

503
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,120
Joon and I buried a time capsule on that hill when we were little.

504
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,280
I forgot to take it out on the date that we promised.

505
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,480
I'll be off then. I'll see you next time.

506
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,640
Ha Ram, wait. You need to sign this.

507
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,000
Don't you want to say goodbye to her?

508
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,280
She looks happy.

509
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,280
Thank you.

510
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,640
I'm going to think of her as my birth mother...

511
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,320
and take good care of her on behalf of Joon.

512
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,240
I'm going to forget about the past and live a happy life.

513
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,800
So I hope you live a happy life with Ha Ram as well.

514
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,000
Make sure you send me a wedding invitation when you two get married.

515
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,440
I promise I'll be there.

516
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,160
Sun Young.

517
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,320
Be happy.

518
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,440
I'm sorry, Moo Gang.

519
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,880
I'll go now.

520
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,920
Mom.

521
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,240
I hope you're happy too.

522
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,880
I have just one last thing to do.

523
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,560
She's gone.

524
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,600
Now that Sun Young's gone,

525
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,080
everything's finally over.

526
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,760
Mom, give me your handbag. I'll put it inside my luggage bag.

527
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,440
- Will you do that for me? - Sure.

528
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
What?

529
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,000
What's this?

530
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
It won't take long.

531
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,960
Something urgent came up. Please stay at my house for a bit.

532
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,400
- I'll be right there. - Okay, go on.

533
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,480
Get in.

534
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,880
See you.

535
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,080
The phone is turned off.

536
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,240
Please leave a message after the tone.

537
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,520
I found out the name of Kang Soo Hyuk's daughter.

538
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,880
But where in the world does she live?

539
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,760
Moo Gang. This has to be Moo Gang.

540
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,880
Moo Gang.

541
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,720
You must've regained your memory since you've finally called me.

542
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,200
Lee Byeong Tae?

543
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,600
I'm Kim Sun Young.

544
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,440
Please don't hang up.

545
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,720
You saw Kim Young Seok get released, right?

546
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,080
I even testified everything to the prosecution,

547
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,520
but they're not even investigating. Why do you think that is?

548
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,400
That's because we can't catch him without that videotape.

549
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,880
Please. We really need to meet.

550
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,400
Then let's meet right now.

551
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,760
You've never been here...

552
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,280
ever since you went to Canada after your mom passed away, have you?

553
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,440
That's right.

554
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,680
I saw the article. I'm sorry for everything.

555
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,160
Are you still upset...

556
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,920
about what happened back then?

557
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,440
How could you give him that tape, you fool?

558
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,760
I tried so hard to hide it from him. What are you doing to do now?

559
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,640
What are you going to do?

560
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,240
What's on that videotape?

561
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,680
I'm really sorry for what happened.

562
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,160
What? Leo showed Joon that videotape?

563
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,480
I guess he told Han Moo Gang about his heart transplant...

564
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,200
so that he could protect his dad.

565
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,640
Is this Lee Byeong Tae's car?

566
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,440
Yes. The fingerprints from this vehicle...

567
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,760
and the fingerprints from the restaurant match.

568
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,360
- I see. - Look.

569
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,160
- There's a name card here. - You're right.

570
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,840
(Moojin Car Center)

571
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,080
"Moojin Car Center"?

572
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,320
Oh, this guy?

573
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,120
He came here looking for the child fortune-teller.

574
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,400
- The child fortune-teller? - Yes.

575
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,480
When I told him that she's a detective's daughter,

576
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,720
he asked me the location of Moojin Police Station.

577
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,160
Moojin Police Station?

578
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,000
Check the photo again. Are you sure?

579
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,320
Yes.

580
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,600
- Okay, thank you. - Sure.

581
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,960
- Let's go. - Thank you.

582
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,640
- Goodbye. - Bye.

583
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,920
Yes, he came to see me.

584
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,680
He asked me about Detective Kang Soo Hyuk's daughter.

585
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,440
Detective Kang's daughter?

586
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,400
Are you talking about Kang Ha Ram?

587
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,320
What? Does that mean she knows something about that videotape?

588
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,920
Hey, call Moo Gang.

589
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,080
Okay.

590
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,840
Wait. Detective Han's probably flying to the US right now.

591
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,760
Then try to find out Kang Ha Ram's number.

592
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,560
Oh, wait. I think I got her number when she made a statement before.

593
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,480
Wait a second. I have her number.

594
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,200
- It's 010... - Do you have it?

595
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,960
You're Kim Sun Young?

596
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,800
Do you know where the videotape is?

597
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,760
Why isn't the prosecution investigating Kim Young Seok?

598
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,800
There's someone behind him, isn't there?

599
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,760
I started this, so I'll end it.

600
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,280
I'll bring the videotape to the press and tell them everything.

601
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,200
So tell me where it is.

602
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,520
I don't have it. Kang Ha Ram has it.

603
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,240
Who?

604
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,360
What?

605
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,160
What was this videotape?

606
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh, right. This videotape...

607
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,760
I heard he's going to hold a concert in Moojin,

608
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,080
so I spent all night to buy these.

609
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
Sun Young.

610
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,160
I missed you so much during the year I was apart from you.

611
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,560
You know I like you, right?

612
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,600
Happy birthday.

613
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,760
I'm not going to let her watch this.

614
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,800
My gosh.

615
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,640
That means Joon will be recorded on this video.

616
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,800
What? What's wrong with this? Is it broken?

617
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,880
How dare you refuse?

618
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,080
Come here. Sit down.

619
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,160
- What's this? - Let me go!

620
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,040
How... How could he do this?

621
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Come here.

622
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,880
I can't believe this.

623
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,760
What is this?

624
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,760
What? Were there two of these?

625
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,720
I remember burying only one videotape.

626
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,120
What happened to the Grim Reaper that was in Kang Soo Hyuk's body?

627
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,200
He disappeared.

628
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,320
Because he killed a human being.

629
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,240
I don't care. Ha Ram can only be safe if Kim Young Seok dies.

630
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,840
It can't be suicide.

631
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,200
Who in the world killed him?

632
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,720
Oh Man Ho?

633
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,200
Why didn't you pick up your phone? I tried to reach you all day.

634
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
What is it?

635
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,080
I met Kim Young Seok a while ago at his house.

636
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,280
Apparently, Leo gave Joon a videotape when they were young.

637
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,400
And Kim Young Seok beat Leo for giving it to him.

638
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,520
Don't you think that could be it?

639
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,160
Woo Sik gave me a videotape?

640
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,240
Yes.

641
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,320
(Moojin Girls' Middle School)

642
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,000
Isn't that Woo Sik's dad?

643
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,440
Sun Young.

644
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,760
What's wrong?

645
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,080
I guess my memory wasn't fully recovered.

646
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,160
Some parts had been missing.

647
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,760
What?

648
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,720
Where's Kim Young Seok's house?

649
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,160
I'm sorry. I'll go bring the emergency kit.

650
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,440
Your dad's really cool.

651
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,440
He's not cool.

652
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,360
- I don't like my dad. - Why not?

653
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,440
My mom has terminal cancer, but he's never once visited her.

654
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,600
He's the worst.

655
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,320
I wish I at least had a dad.

656
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,600
Hey, you have a video player.

657
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,760
Can I use it?

658
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,800
For what?

659
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,040
I took a video, and I want to see...

660
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,280
if I came out okay.

661
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,360
What?

662
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,080
Where did it go?

663
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,280
Why? Is it something important?

664
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,080
Well, I took a video of me wishing someone a happy birthday.

665
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,280
Then you should take another video.

666
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,800
We have a camera.

667
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,400
Wait here.

668
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,680
That's a relief.

669
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,240
Let's check if this videotape is blank just in case.

670
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,760
You can check. I'll bring the emergency kit.

671
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,720
Sun... Sun Young.

672
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,760
You brat.

673
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,760
Where's the videotape?

674
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,720
It's over here!

675
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,880
The time capsule. I should hide it in there.

676
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,440
What?

677
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,120
Ha Ram?

678
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,200
Her moment of death has not passed yet.

679
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,760
It was because of this.

680
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,760
This is why Ha Ram's going to die.

681
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,720
Stay there. We'll be right there.

682
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,440
My gosh.

683
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,120
Stop it. Give it to me.

684
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,160
- Freeze! - Stop right there!

685
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,120
Stand up. Stand up, you jerk.

686
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,560
- Raise your hands! - Raise your hands! Handcuff him!

687
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,360
- Raise your hands! - Raise your hands!

688
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,880
Hey, watch out!

689
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,960
Sir! Sir!

690
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,440
Run away! Run away!

691
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,640
You little punk. Where do you think you're going?

692
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,760
Move! Get out of my way!

693
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,360
Why can't I teleport again?

694
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,960
As you can see here,

695
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,240
we're the only company that has this kind of insurance package.

696
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,920
If you sign up for this, you can get a deduction on your income tax.

697
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,760
And you can also get...

698
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,800
What? Detective Han.

699
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,320
You said you can get through anything and anyone, right?

700
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,000
I want you to find Choi Geun Ho.

701
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,560
- Who? - Choi Geun Ho.

702
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,800
Choi Geun Ho? Isn't he...

703
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,760
We brought everyone here.

704
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,080
What about Kim Young Seok?

705
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,720
He's dead.

706
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,520
I can't believe I got played by him all these years.

707
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,960
You had a dinner meeting with Oh Chun Su and Woo Byung Sik.

708
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,080
But I noticed that you didn't show up.

709
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,240
So I went to the mountain cabin just in case.

710
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,760
Who... Who sent you here?

711
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,880
Woo Byung Sik told me everything.

712
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,400
I can't believe a respected mayor like you had sex with a teenager.

713
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,720
On top of that, it was exactly when Moojin Time Mart collapsed.

714
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,680
You weren't away on vacation.

715
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,200
If people find out that you were late...

716
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,120
because you were having sex with a teenager,

717
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,800
what will happen to you in the future?

718
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,400
Without realizing that he had lost the tape,

719
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,840
we humored him all this time.

720
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,520
You'd better do your job right.

721
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,560
I'm sorry, sir.

722
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,240
Didn't you realize that he had lost it 20 years ago?

723
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,760
Goodness.

724
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,640
Captain Bong. Everyone.

725
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,120
Ha Ram, there's nothing to be scared of.

726
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,720
We'll be fine. Someone will come for us soon.

727
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,680
So be calm.

728
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,880
Shut your mouth.

729
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,880
- No. - Hit me instead!

730
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,880
Hey, he's just an old man.

731
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,920
Be quiet.

732
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,680
Hit me instead, you punks!

733
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,000
You already hid the tape, didn't you?

734
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

735
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,520
Captain Bong, I found the tape.

736
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,920
I also have Choi Geun Ho's tape.

737
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,920
They're completely insane.

738
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,960
That's right.

739
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,840
I hid the tape. So what?

740
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,200
Stop.

741
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,400
You're a horrible man.

742
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,680
While hundreds of people were dying at Time Mart,

743
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,080
while children were dying under rubbles,

744
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,720
you were committing a terrible crime.

745
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,320
You covered up what Kim Young Seok did too.

746
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,440
I knew it.

747
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,280
I knew that the scale of the crime...

748
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,160
was too great for a congressman.

749
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,320
You're very smart.

750
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,680
How can you call yourself a human being?

751
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,160
Where did you hide the tape?

752
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,240
If it's exposed,

753
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,760
I'll be in trouble.

754
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,200
"Trouble"?

755
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,760
Because of your nasty tape,

756
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,760
do you know how many people died?

757
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,880
I won't tell you. Give it a try.

758
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,120
You're worse than dogs.

759
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,640
Do whatever it takes to find out.

760
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,520
Tell us.

761
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,920
Otherwise, they'll die too.

762
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,680
No, please.

763
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,960
I'll tell you. I'll tell you!

764
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,840
No, don't tell them, Ha Ram!

765
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,040
They'll kill us anyway.

766
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,080
He saw who he was. He won't let us live.

767
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,360
We have to keep the tape away from them.

768
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,040
Someone will definitely find it.

769
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,000
Let's have him be judged, okay?

770
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,720
Take them away.

771
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,720
Don't tell him. Don't tell him!

772
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,320
- No, Ha Ram. - Don't say anything.

773
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,720
No. Please don't kill them.

774
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Tell me.

775
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,720
This is your last chance.

776
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,600
Where's the tape?

777
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,040
- What happened? - Darn it.

778
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,320
Who are you?

779
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,600
What?

780
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,920
Who are you?

781
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,160
Me?

782
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,600
I'm 444.

783
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,920
You'll find out soon.

784
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,400
Who...

785
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,800
Who are you?

786
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,840
Fall into a fiery pit.

787
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,760
Ha Ram.

788
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,120
Be happy from now on.

789
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,880
I'll erase all of your memories.

790
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,800
How do you feel?

791
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,000
- Hello, Captain Bong. - Hello.

792
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,360
I'm much better now. How are the others?

793
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,920
We're fine.

794
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,480
Soo Wan and Byeong Tae are also much better now.

795
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,920
I don't know who it was, but we were saved on time.

796
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,160
I'm glad to hear that.

797
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,480
You protected the tape until the end,

798
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,720
so the truth was revealed.

799
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,440
- Hello. - Hello.

800
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,960
Take care, Ha Ram.

801
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,280
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

802
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,800
Ha Ram, there was a letter for you at home.

803
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,320
I think it's from Detective Han.

804
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,160
(From Han Moo Gang, To Kang Ha Ram)

805
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,200
There's no water.

806
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,080
My operation went well.

807
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,360
I'll be in hospital for a while.

808
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,200
When I'm released, I'll travel the world.

809
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,040
Take care of yourself well.

810
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,920
If anyone attacks you, curse at them.

811
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,520
Okay?

812
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,560
Ha Ram, be well.

813
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I miss you.

814
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,600
I'm glad that his operation went well.

815
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,600
If someone attacks your face, block like this.

816
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,880
It still hurts.

817
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,240
So how is Ha Ram?

818
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,840
I thought she was seriously injured, but she got well quickly.

819
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,360
It's because she's young. When I was at that age,

820
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,840
I flew over the mountains in only my underwear.

821
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,840
I'm also young, but I don't heal fast. My shoulder hurts.

822
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,680
Your body is old.

823
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,120
By the way,

824
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,400
who saved us back then?

825
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,720
I think...

826
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,560
it was Moo Gang.

827
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,600
I think I heard Moo Gang's voice when I was unconscious.

828
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,360
Detective Han went to the US to receive surgery.

829
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,760
Do you have hearing problems?

830
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,040
Did you take a CT of your brain?

831
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,360
Right? I guess I was imagining things.

832
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,920
This way.

833
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,560
Come here.

834
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,000
He'll be fine.

835
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,960
What about the body of Moo Gang's brother at the clinic?

836
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,600
Once they find his body without a heart, they'll investigate.

837
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,240
I have an idea.

838
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,440
- Yes? - Doctor Park.

839
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,680
We have a brain-dead patient,

840
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,360
and his blood type is A RH negative.

841
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,080
You should prepare your son for surgery. Hurry up.

842
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,560
What... What's wrong?

843
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,080
Why? What's wrong?

844
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,840
I'm sorry.

845
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,520
I'm sorry, Moo Chan.

846
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,439
I should've...

847
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,680
waited just a little longer.

848
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:47,640
Moo Gang, please forgive me.

849
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,439
All I wanted to do...

850
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,960
was to save you.

851
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,080
I didn't think about anything else.

852
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,920
I'm sorry.

853
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,520
Your brother's body...

854
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,120
is beneath the cliff at the seaside of Moojin.

855
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,880
(I am a sinner who cannot be forgiven even after I die.)

856
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,359
It turns out that Kim Joon was shot in the head.

857
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:17,680
What? Where?

858
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,359
According to Detective Han's mother's will,

859
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,680
I think he got shot at the glass factory in Moojin.

860
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:31,600
The glass factory?

861
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,920
Detective Han...

862
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,520
must've known everything.

863
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,880
Just keep living as a human being.

864
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,920
But...

865
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,640
under one condition.

866
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,560
I want you to protect...

867
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,800
Ha Ram.

868
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,480
Kim Joon's death and the disappearance of Han Moo Gang.

869
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,280
Protect her so that she can live without knowing...

870
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,360
the truth.

871
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,000
That's the only reason I'm letting you stay alive.

872
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,080
What should I do?

873
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,200
She found out about the secret you wanted to hide from her.

874
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,560
I guess she's going to find out about that fake photo.

875
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,520
Then what about the surgery?

876
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,480
He said he would go with his mom.

877
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,040
Then where...

878
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,840
is Detective Han?

879
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,360
How's this possible?

880
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,800
I tried looking, but I can't find it anywhere.

881
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,240
Can you please check Detective Han's flight records?

882
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,960
Something was odd, so we tried to find that as well.

883
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,400
But it turns out that he never left the country.

884
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,000
My gosh.

885
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,920
He...

886
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,080
He sent me a photo.

887
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,200
He sent me a photo and a letter.

888
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,520
We already checked with the hospital in the US.

889
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,840
And they said they've never heard of him.

890
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,320
My goodness.

891
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,320
Captain Bong.

892
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,800
- What is it? - Why?

893
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,160
What's wrong with you now?

894
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,440
What is it?

895
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,760
Why are you so serious?

896
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,600
I... I found something on CCTV footage.

897
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,640
What is it?

898
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,640
Is... Is this Moo Gang?

899
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,040
What should we do?

900
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,400
My gosh, Moo Gang.

901
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,120
My gosh, what should we do?

902
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,280
What is with you guys?

903
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,600
Why are you crying?

904
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,040
Hurry up, and get ready to investigate what happened. Hurry!

905
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,040
Poor Moo Gang.

906
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,160
Hello, sir. Yes.

907
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,800
Please let us use a helicopter. Yes, it's very urgent.

908
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,200
Yes, that's right.

909
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,960
You broke rule number one of the underworld.

910
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,960
Do you admit to having harmed a human being?

911
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,920
Yes, I do.

912
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,760
You broke the one thing you should never do as a Grim Reaper.

913
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,680
I sentence you to the maximum sentence...

914
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,000
Black.

915
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,120
Ha Ram found out about everything.

916
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,000
What?

917
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,480
She found out about what happened.

918
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,440
Let me ask you for a favor.

919
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,200
I killed everyone.

920
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,680
If I could ever be reborn again,

921
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,320
I want...

922
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,200
to be reborn...

923
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,880
as an ordinary person.

924
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,760
I sentence you to the maximum sentence, dissipation.

925
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,760
Instead of dissipation,

926
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,800
please sentence me to the maximum sentence of this underworld.

927
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,840
Don't you know what happens if you kill humans?

928
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,040
You will cease to exist! That's the maximum penalty!

929
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,320
That's not the maximum penalty.

930
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
What?

931
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,960
There's a stronger punishment than dissipation.

932
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,160
Dissipation means you'll disappear.

933
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,920
But the maximum penalty means your existence itself will be denied.

934
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,520
You'll never have existed in the first place...

935
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,360
because you never did.

936
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,440
No one will ever remember you.

937
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,920
Please sentence me...

938
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,480
to the maximum sentence of this underworld.

939
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,880
Please help me.

940
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,240
You're going to get dissipated. I can't stop that from happening.

941
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,480
No, that's not it. I'm asking you to help me get a stronger sentence.

942
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,040
Are you talking about...

943
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,880
I want to set things right.

944
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,400
If this never happened at all,

945
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,480
Ha Ram will be able to live a happy life.

946
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,840
Are you worried that she'll live unhappily for the rest of her life?

947
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,680
He's right.

948
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,880
He violently killed a human being.

949
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,520
His nature of crime is too cruel and evil.

950
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,400
So in order to prevent this kind of thing from happening again,

951
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,840
please punish him and set an example for the others.

952
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,560
I shall hand down a ruling.

953
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,800
Prisoner 420.

954
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,440
I sentence you to the maximum sentence.

955
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,040
You will have never existed at all.

956
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,720
- Let me try. - I can do it too.

957
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,800
I stopped...

958
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,840
Ha Ram's parents from getting into an accident.

959
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,880
Ha Ram was born as a normal girl.

960
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,520
She didn't see the shadows of death.

961
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,920
- Hello. - Hello.

962
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:45,080
(Award given by the president, To Kang Ha Ram)

963
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,960
"So the Grim Reaper..."

964
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,120
"was erased from everyone's memories."

965
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,800
"And the others..."

966
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,880
"lived happily ever after."

967
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,520
"This is the story of the foolish Grim Reaper..."

968
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,400
"who loved a human being."

969
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,880
Are you crying?

970
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,080
What kind of ending is that?

971
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,640
He's erased even from the memories...

972
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,240
of the woman he loved.

973
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,440
So...

974
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,240
what happened to the woman?

975
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,720
She can't remember the Grim Reaper,

976
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,960
so she lived happily ever after.

977
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,000
Goodness.

978
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,080
That poor Grim Reaper.

979
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,800
By the way,

980
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,960
you told such a cruel story to the children.

981
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,400
Are you out of your mind?

982
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,440
I told the story after the children fell asleep.

983
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,880
Besides, on Halloween,

984
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,880
a mysterious thriller is the best.

985
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,680
You're showing off that you were an actor once.

986
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,840
Their mother won't like it.

987
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,400
It must be their mother.

988
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,160
I almost forgot.

989
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,720
Here.

990
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,800
It's a Halloween present.

991
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,080
A present?

992
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,880
You didn't have to do that.

993
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,360
At times like this,

994
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,200
a friend is better...

995
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,200
than my late husband.

996
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,520
- Thank you. - I'm leaving now.

997
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,880
I'm sorry...

998
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,200
for remembering only now.

999
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,280
Have you been well?

1000
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,920
Yes.

1001
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,680
I've been well.

1002
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,920
Were you happy?

1003
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,640
I was.

1004
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,600
I was very happy.

1005
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,520
I'm happy to hear that.

1006
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,760
Did you come to pick me up?

1007
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,240
Let's go.

1008
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,320
(Black)

1009
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,760
(Thank you for watching.)

1010
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,000
("Black" was a story about how human desires and greed...)

1011
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,840
(influence those around us.)

1012
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,000
(We hope it was a chance to reflect on the people around us.)

1013
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,840
("Black" was based on...)

1014
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,800
(events that won't be forgotten.)

1015
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,600
(We hope that it gave strength...)

1016
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,880
(to the victims and their families from those events.)

1017
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,800
(Thank you again for watching.)

1018
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,680
(From the staff members of Black)

1019
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,680
Come on, and play.

1020
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,360
Come on. Please?

1021
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,000
Can you please not do that?

1022
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,200
I thought everyone liked that.

1023
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,480
Let's just let her do that.

1024
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,760
I'll punch her next time.

1025
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,760
- I tried so hard. - Now?

1026
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,760
Okay.

1027
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,360
I'll stop.

1028
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,480
- You're too close. - Gosh.

1029
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,160
- Step aside. - Move a little farther.

1030
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,640
Joon?

1031
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,040
Why does she call you Joon?

1032
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,600
Did you also know that I had a sister?

1033
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,640
- You're supposed to say "brother". - Brother.

1034
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,200
- Goodness. - What did he say?

1035
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,760
- Do it for real. - Do it.

1036
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,720
They can't do it.

1037
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,080
That must hurt.

1038
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,160
Don't you like me?

1039
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,640
He doesn't look at me.

1040
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,640
- Over there. - What's wrong?

1041
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,440
- Look at him. - He's about to cry.

1042
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,520
- Look at me. - Look at him.

1043
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,480
- Hey, you try it. - Okay.

1044
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,720
- That's okay. That's enough. - Don't kick so hard.

1045
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,840
- Your toenails might break. - Let's move on to another scene.

1046
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,440
Listen. How could Captain Long...

1047
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,360
- I said Captain Long... - Gosh.

1048
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,160
- It's Captain Bong. - It's Captain Bong.

1049
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,600
- I made a mistake. - Say it clearly.

1050
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,360
- I named a new character. - That was funny.

1051
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,040
What happened? Did you save him?

1052
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,280
I have a favor to ask you.

1053
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,080
What?

1054
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,520
What?

1055
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,560
Tell me what it is.

1056
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,240
Seriously.
