00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,160
(Episode 5)

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
Yes.

3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,720
I cannot let that little kid die.

4
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,880
What are you doing here now?

5
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,600
I'll do it.

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,360
What?

7
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,840
I'll do what you asked me to do. I'll stay by your side at all times.

8
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll be glued to you.

9
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,960
Is that right?

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm glad to hear that.

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
So let's save his life.

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,400
Let's try to save that boy's life together.

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,600
Come on. Let's go.

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Where are we going?

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,000
To save that boy's life. I saw the shadow on him.

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Seriously?

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,200
What kind of psycho can do that to such a little kid?

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,360
Anyway, if I ever catch him,

19
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,920
I'll put a million cockroaches inside him and sew him up.

20
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,640
About that shadow...

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,760
Are you sure that it was inside his body?

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,680
How can he bury a little boy alive?

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,040
He shouldn't call himself a human!

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,600
And he even threw chocolate bars at him.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,680
That crazy... That insane psychopath.

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,440
The shadow wasn't inside his body, was it?

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,840
I wouldn't have been able to touch the shadow if it had been inside.

28
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,040
I wouldn't have been able to foresee how he'd die either.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Gosh, thank goodness.

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,320
I was lucky to touch it because it was outside his body.

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey, wait.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,720
You don't have time to get changed.

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,760
We don't know when that boy will die.

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,240
Let's go. We need to catch the culprit as soon as possible.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,760
Oh, we just need to find a man with a bandage...

36
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,720
that has the "Excellent job" stamp on.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Let's go.

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm busy.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,440
Sorry? Wait.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,640
You came all the way to my place to ask me to save lives with you.

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,680
Plus, how busy can you be at this late hour?

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,800
Here. Can't you see this?

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,880
What happened?

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,240
I must find the jerk who did this to me,

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,040
so go by yourself if you want to save that boy, okay?

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,680
Saving his life or not, do whatever you want.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,240
Wait. That boy will die.

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,920
He'll be buried alive and die.

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
So what?

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,760
I want to know when you see the shadow inside, not outside!

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Tell me when you see the black shadow inside someone's body, okay?

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,640
Why is he changing his words now?

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,840
You bonehead.

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,360
You said you wanted to save lives with me!

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,000
What an absurd jerk.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,520
- Gosh, open the door! - That foul mouth of hers.

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,120
How uncivilized. My gosh.

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,680
For goodness' sake.

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,079
It's her, isn't it?

60
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,040
She's the woman we saw on the bridge, isn't she?

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,320
Yes, it's her.

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Why are you guys out here? She could've seen you.

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,480
We're sorry.

64
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,520
By the way, why did she come to see you?

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,680
Did she say she'll do it? Will she be glued to you at all times?

66
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,680
I'll make her do it.

67
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,720
Why did you make her leave though?

68
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,000
She was pestering me about saving a boy.

69
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,560
How nosy. She has no idea that she's going to die herself.

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,960
She should just help me find that loser.

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,640
Are you sure you want to leave her be like that?

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,240
If that woman ends up saving that boy's life,

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,640
how will you handle that?

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,520
I don't care whether she saves him or not. It has nothing to do with...

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
Hang on.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,760
If that girl ends up saving that kid's life...

77
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,480
The kid destined to die will not die...

78
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,080
because of that woman you saved.

79
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,320
What does that mean?

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,480
If you collected that woman's soul as planned,

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,040
she wouldn't be able to save the boy's life. Then ultimately...

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
Exactly.

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
The boy destined to die will live because of 444,

84
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,480
which means that he'll end up meddling in humans' affairs.

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,960
And what happens when we meddle in humans' life and death matters?

86
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
You might be put on the brink of perishment.

87
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,120
Your fate will be put in peril.

88
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,480
Gosh, stop using those idioms. You get them wrong all the time.

89
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,160
You've been watching too many historical dramas.

90
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,280
You brat.

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,280
I didn't think about that.

92
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,000
I must stop her.

93
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Hey!

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,720
Hey!

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,360
Where did she go?

96
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,800
Hey.

97
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,600
What's going on? Has she already gone to save him?

98
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,360
Gosh, she's so fast.

99
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,160
I knew that you'd come out from there again.

100
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,000
You stupid little... I know what's going on.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,080
Hey, be honest with me.

102
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
About what?

103
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,800
You...

104
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,920
suffer from constipation, right?

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,640
Hey, I need to button my pants. Gosh, let go of me!

106
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,280
Goodness gracious.

107
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,080
Gosh, you jerk. My hands feel icky.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,960
- Let's see... - Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

109
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,560
That'd be nice.

110
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,600
Good. It's delicious.

111
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,800
Jerk, did you really have to take a sip?

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
Isn't it good?

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,840
Now, it's your turn to do this for me.

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,120
My gosh, you make great coffee.

115
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,280
It's delicious.

116
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,280
Oh, right. About that special forces agent...

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
I heard that he ended up dead.

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,240
Gosh, it sounds like he and his wife loved each other very much.

119
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,720
- After his wife died, he wanted... - Cut it out. Just do it for me.

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,720
You can find where anyone is with their phone numbers alone.

121
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
Gosh, you're such a handful.

122
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,840
Hey, how many times have I told you?

123
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,000
You need to bring a warrant if you want to track anyone's location.

124
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,600
Gosh, you idiot.

125
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,560
Think about it. It's not like he's a suspect...

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,800
or somebody reported to us about him.

127
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,000
You may be a detective,

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,920
but it's illegal to track people's locations for no reason.

129
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240
You'll get arrested.

130
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,360
Move.

131
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,840
You little...

132
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,640
Gosh, I shall be the bigger person and put up with you.

133
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,440
Hey, how can you call Captain Bong "short-legged grandpa"?

134
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,800
We even put up with that.

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
What would I gain by fighting a patient?

136
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,200
You must think that you can get away...

137
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,680
with anything because of that bullet in your head.

138
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,360
Hey, you can try all you want, but it won't work.

139
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,360
You stubborn brat.

140
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,760
By the way, why isn't my wife picking up?

141
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,720
The phone is turned off.

142
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,880
Please leave a message after the tone.

143
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
After you're connected...

144
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
Is she having an affair or what? Why isn't she picking up?

145
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
Seoun Police Station? Why does it say she's here?

146
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Honey!

147
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,000
Honey!

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,160
Surprise! I brought you some food.

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,240
(Seoun Police Station)

150
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
Seoun Police Station.

151
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,720
How does this thing know that she's here?

152
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,640
It's so delicious. I'll give you some too.

153
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,160
Now, I understand what people mean by "cringing".

154
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,200
Hey, how did you know...

155
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,680
that woman with chili pepper paste on her lips was here?

156
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,120
Is he talking about my lipstick now?

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Honey.

158
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,280
Relax.

159
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,160
I told you.

160
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,640
He's not all there.

161
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
What?

162
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,480
Oh, my darling's location?

163
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,240
I found her by using the Friend Locator.

164
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,000
Friend Locator? I want to use it too.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,320
Hey, you can't just start using it.

166
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,200
You must first add each other as friends like us lovebirds.

167
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
But you already added her. Kang Ha Ram, right?

168
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,360
What?

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
- Let's eat. - Okay.

170
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,400
When did this happen?

171
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,920
Bye, kids.

172
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
Daddy, we want fried chicken. Buy us fried chicken!

173
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,120
Okay. See you later!

174
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm hungry.

175
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Who is it?

176
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,800
Hello, ma'am. I'm Geon Young's homeroom teacher.

177
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
- Hello. - Hello.

178
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,000
Sir, what brings you here?

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,960
I was in the area to take care of something,

180
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,000
and I thought I should go to school with Geon Young.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,440
Actually, I was just about to call you.

182
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,800
He had diarrhea all night because he went out and ate chocolate...

183
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,640
while I stepped out for a few minutes yesterday.

184
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,320
I think he should stay home and get some rest today.

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,320
How is he now?

186
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
I gave him some medicine, and he just fell asleep.

187
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, would you like to see him?

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
No, it's all right.

189
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,080
Well, please give me a call when he wakes up.

190
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,000
- Sure. - Then I'll get going.

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,480
- Oh, okay. - Take care.

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,200
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

193
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
- Excuse me. - Yes?

194
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,440
Are you Geon Young's teacher?

195
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,320
Yes.

196
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,240
But who are you?

197
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,000
I just wanted to ask you about something.

198
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,560
By any chance, does Geon Young know someone...

199
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,560
who has bandages wrapped around his hand...

200
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,000
That darn banana.

201
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,600
Are you okay?

202
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,520
- Are you all right? - Gosh.

203
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,880
My gosh, why did that banana have to be on the street?

205
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,320
He isn't seriously hurt, is he?

206
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,840
What?

207
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,800
- Hang in there. - Okay.

208
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,280
No way.

209
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

210
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,520
It's nothing but just a little tear.

211
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,280
I can remove the bandages in a few days.

212
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,560
What was the thing you wanted to ask me earlier?

213
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, about that...

214
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm so forgetful these days. I have a hard time to remember things.

215
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,600
I think I wanted to ask you for directions.

216
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
Gosh, I'm going to be late for my class.

217
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,720
- Goodbye then. - Bye.

218
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,560
He can't be. No.

219
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,840
The one who killed Geon Young...

220
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
had bandages with a stamp on it.

221
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,640
It's different. He's not the one.

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
I'm sure she's here.

223
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,760
Gosh, where did she go again?

224
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,520
What? What's wrong with this? No, no. Hey!

225
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Why now?

226
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,880
I see. It must be that kid. Right.

227
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,800
If I follow him, I'll be able to stop Ha Ram.

228
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,680
Now, let's see how well your drawings are.

229
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,400
What's this? Who are these?

230
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Are they your parents?

231
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
Give me a high five.

232
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Okay.

233
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,600
- Well, this looks good. - Doesn't the heart look nice?

234
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,360
Yes, it looks very nice. I think it'd be good to color it yellow.

235
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,520
Let's see.

236
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,480
Is there a tomato as big as that?

237
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,360
You're so mischievous.

238
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,720
That's right. He even saved me from that accident.

239
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,000
That kind of a man would never kill Geon Young.

240
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
Your drawing looks so good.

241
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,560
Please stamp my drawing then. Please stamp it.

242
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,920
- Shall I stamp it? - Yes.

243
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,840
Okay. I'll stamp your drawings. Bring your drawings to me.

244
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,400
Here. Well done.

245
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,720
Is this Pikachu?

246
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,280
Here you go.

247
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,200
You did such a great job, so I'll stamp it hard.

248
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Hey.

249
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,160
What is this?

250
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,480
What are you doing?

251
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,400
My bandages have an "Excellent job" stamp now.

252
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,880
I stamped his bandages.

253
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,440
Hey, Bowl Cut.

254
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,080
Bowl Cut.

255
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
Do you know how expensive it was to have this hair done?

256
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,800
Also, my name isn't Bowl Cut. It's Han Jin Sook.

257
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,880
Why are you wandering around this late in the night?

258
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,840
Clara might kick you out.

259
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,880
- I'm going to see my friend. - Your friend?

260
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,400
You have no friends.

261
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,960
I do have friends. Seriously.

262
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
You silly.

263
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,320
Did she hurt her leg?

264
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,360
No, she has polio.

265
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,680
Because of that, it looks like...

266
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,280
her parents abandoned her at an orphanage when she was little.

267
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,000
She lives in a bar doing chores now.

268
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,920
I feel so bad for her.

269
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
She's such a good kid.

270
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,000
(Corporal Song Jae Geun)

271
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,760
(Escaped before the crackdown. Did someone leak information?)

272
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,640
(Possibility of teenage prostitution, can it be Bowl Cut?)

273
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,760
(Loser)

274
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,120
This phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

275
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,720
We need to find a man in bandages with an "Excellent job" stamp.

276
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Let's go.

277
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,560
Go by yourself if you want to save that boy, okay?

278
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,920
Saving his life or not, do whatever you want.

279
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,600
Wait. That boy will die.

280
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,360
- He'll be buried alive and die. - So what?

281
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,160
Why aren't you coming to work?

282
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
Aren't you going to report to me the VIP list you checked yesterday?

283
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,440
Sir, something urgent came up.

284
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,640
Could you find out information about someone in a hurry?

285
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,440
- What? - You got...

286
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,960
my number and address through someone you know in the police.

287
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,200
He's a teacher at Sarang Elementary School in Moojin.

288
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,840
I don't know his name. He seems to be in his early or mid 30s.

289
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,400
I'll send you his picture now. Thank you.

290
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,080
Ms. Fortune-teller!

291
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,160
My gosh.

292
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,720
Does she think I'm a private detective?

293
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,680
What? Mr. Song.

294
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,920
Hi, Man Soo.

295
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,360
You're here. It must be hard for you.

296
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,920
Not at all. Are you visiting my dad?

297
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,440
Yes. How is he?

298
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,920
- Who is that? - What?

299
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,800
He's a police officer.

300
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,440
He patrols our neighborhood sometimes.

301
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,520
You didn't tell him anything, did you?

302
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,400
Of course not. If I did, Clara will kick me out.

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
- I'm sorry. I've been busy. - It's okay.

304
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,920
- I'll take you to his room. - Would you?

305
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,600
- Excuse me. - Gosh.

306
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,600
Doctor.

307
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,800
Here. You dropped your pen.

308
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,600
Thank you.

309
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,720
- Man Soo. - Yes?

310
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm sure you're busy. You can go now.

311
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,520
I'll just see him for a while and leave.

312
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,040
Okay. Take care then.

313
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,520
All right. Congratulations on your promotion. Cheers.

314
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,320
- Thank you. - Also,

315
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
I wish your business...

316
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,080
to grow beyond Moojin and nationwide. Cheers!

317
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,000
That watch looks new.

318
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,440
It looks very unique and classy.

319
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,680
- It's expensive, right? - This is not a watch.

320
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,360
It's an artwork.

321
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
It's made by a Swiss master craftsman,

322
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,800
Schneider El... Something. El...

323
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,280
I can't remember. Anyway, it's made by a world-famous craftsman.

324
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,600
He even made all of the parts himself too.

325
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,120
Schneider? No wonder.

326
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
It's so luxurious.

327
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,280
Surely, you should wear something like this...

328
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
as the president of Chunsu Insurance.

329
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,640
It will make you look dignified as the president.

330
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,800
By the way, how much is it?

331
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,360
I don't know. Someone gave it to me as a gift.

332
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,640
Anyway, to your success.

333
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,280
- Cheers. - Cheers.

334
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm sure it was his watch.

335
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
Are the things written on it true?

336
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,640
Is what the woman named Clara said really true?

337
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,600
She says you got sexual favors from a teenage girl. Is that true?

338
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,680
Please answer me now!

339
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,640
- I... - Why did you do that?

340
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,800
Are you insane?

341
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,600
If we start investigating...

342
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,080
Jae Geun.

343
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,200
I must have been out of my mind back then.

344
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,960
I know I did something crazy.

345
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,800
If people find out about this, it'll ruin my company and my family.

346
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,120
It will destroy everything I've built.

347
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Look, Jae Geun. Please let this slide just once.

348
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,080
That hostess of the bar. Please silence her, would you?

349
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Even if I did,

350
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,280
if that teenage girl tells the truth, it will end me too.

351
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,920
I heard she ran away. She will never show up.

352
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,360
So please.

353
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,560
Man... Man Ho.

354
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,280
Look who it is.

355
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,640
It's been such a long time.

356
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,320
You look very nice now that you're a commissioner general.

357
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,360
Your way of speaking still hasn't changed.

358
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,160
Man Ho.

359
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,360
It's about the watch your dad used to wear back in Moojin.

360
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,600
Do you remember it?

361
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,040
It had a butterfly shape.

362
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,840
Oh, that watch.

363
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,640
He gave it to me...

364
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,880
when he and I were still on good terms.

365
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,440
Why are you suddenly asking about it?

366
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,720
What?

367
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,320
It's nothing.

368
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,760
I just thought of the time when your dad was showing it off to me.

369
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,760
I didn't realize the time.

370
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,120
I should get going.

371
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes. It's me.

372
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
I must speak with you.

373
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,720
I'll go over there now, so let's talk in person.

374
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,240
Eun Hye. Eun Hye?

375
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,080
Eun Hye.

376
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,560
This darn brat.

377
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,000
Gosh, why is he taking so long to find information about someone?

378
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,160
Maybe he lied about how he had connections in the police.

379
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,480
Hi, did you find out?

380
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
He doesn't seem to have any problems.

381
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,920
- Really? - Yes.

382
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,440
His evaluation as a teacher is good,

383
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,720
and he won the great educator award.

384
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,600
He majored in special education in Paris.

385
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,320
He also worked at a special-education school there.

386
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,640
He's an elite.

387
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,760
Really?

388
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Gosh, have I been mistaken?

389
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,000
I think he worked all over in Europe and not just in France.

390
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,360
He did a lot of volunteer work too.

391
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,600
Okay. I have to go now.

392
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
Hold on a second.

393
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,480
What the...

394
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,080
What is it?

395
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,200
This... This jerk...

396
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,880
What? What is it?

397
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,160
This jerk was arrested in Paris...

398
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,600
for child molestation and possession of child pornography.

399
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
What? Child molestation?

400
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,360
Child pornography?

401
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,240
It says the victim was one of his mentally handicapped students.

402
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,440
The prosecution was suspended because he fled back to Korea.

403
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,240
Ms. Fortune-teller. How do you know this scumbag...

404
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,920
Ms. Fortune-teller?

405
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,360
So that's why he kidnapped and killed Geon Young.

406
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,720
That jerk deserves to be covered in feces.

407
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,440
My gosh.

408
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,960
I'm sorry.

409
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,560
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry.

410
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,200
Wait. This place is...

411
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,320
Eun Hye.

412
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,800
"Eun Hye"? Is that the name of your apartment?

413
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,640
He was looking for his teacher's house, not his own.

414
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,360
Eun Hye Apartment.

415
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,840
Eun Hye. Eun Hye Apartment.

416
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,160
Where...

417
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
As soon as this jerk comes out, I'll kill him.

418
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,000
What? Isn't that...

419
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,440
Wait.

420
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,720
Hi. I'm the person who took Geon Young to the police station.

421
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,240
Is Geon Young home?

422
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,840
You're watching him, right?

423
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,360
Actually,

424
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,760
- Geon Young disappeared... - Geon Young!

425
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,280
while his mom was in the bathroom.

426
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,880
- Geon Young! - We're looking for him now.

427
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,400
No.

428
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,080
No.

429
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,640
Stop the car. Stop the car right now!

430
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,960
Are you crazy?

431
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
You're the woman...

432
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,240
You scumbag.

433
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,600
Open the trunk now.

434
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,160
- Open the trunk now! - What are you? Get off me!

435
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,880
What's her problem?

436
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,960
Stop the car! Stop it right now!

437
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,080
Let Geon Young go.

438
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,280
- Let Geon Young go! - What a crazy witch.

439
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,680
Let Geon Young go!

440
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,240
No! No!

441
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
Open the door!

442
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,640
Stop the car.

443
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,680
Stop the car.

444
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,960
Right. You must be desperate to die.

445
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I'll fulfill your wish and kill you.

446
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,240
Let Geon Young go! Let him go.

447
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,480
What... What is this?

448
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
What was that?

449
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,880
You jerk.

450
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,480
What...

451
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,960
My gosh.

452
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,880
Hey.

453
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,600
My gosh. Geon Young. Geon Young.

454
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,480
Geon Young.

455
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,000
Geon Young. Geon Young.

456
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,520
What are you guys doing here?

457
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,040
Do you want to go to my house and see my puppy?

458
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,120
No, Geon Young. You should go home.

459
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,440
- Your mom's waiting for you. - I want to go too.

460
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,480
Geon Young, you can come next time. Okay?

461
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,480
Let's go, Eun Hye.

462
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,960
I want to see his puppy too.

463
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,840
I want to see his puppy.

464
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,560
Eun Hye, it might be a little suffocating, but hang in there.

465
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,440
If you make any noise, you won't be able to see my puppy. Okay?

466
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,720
Puppy.

467
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,960
Puppy.

468
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,440
I want to see the puppy too.

469
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,159
Puppy.

470
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,239
What?

471
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,760
Puppy. Puppy.

472
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,600
Puppy.

473
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,199
Eun Hye.

474
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,240
Do you want to poop?

475
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,120
My stomach hurts.

476
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,280
Are you hungry?

477
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,960
My stomach hurts.

478
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,640
Eun Hye's hungry.

479
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,800
I should get her snacks. Snacks.

480
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,080
My goodness, are you okay?

481
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,720
Hey, are you okay?

482
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,040
Hey.

483
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Hey, little kid.

484
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,360
Hey, what are you doing here?

485
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,320
Don't you know your way home?

486
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,400
Eun Hye. Eun Hye.

487
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,040
"Eun Hye"?

488
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,680
Eun Hye, it's time for your medicine.

489
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,720
Geon Young better not have said anything to anyone.

490
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,040
Sir, what are you doing here?

491
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,800
I wanted to go to school with Geon Young. I'll go now.

492
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,680
- Okay, bye. - Goodbye.

493
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,080
- Bye. - Bye.

494
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,840
I guess he hasn't said anything.

495
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,360
What? Eun Hye's hungry.

496
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,000
Geon Young.

497
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,920
This darn brat.

498
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,320
- Eun Hye, eat this. - I'm scared.

499
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,600
- I miss my grandma. - Are you scared?

500
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,440
- Come on. Let's go. - I'm scared.

501
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,560
Come on. Follow me.

502
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,560
Follow me. Come on.

503
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,960
No, I'm scared.

504
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,800
I miss my grandma.

505
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,400
You little jerk.

506
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
- My goodness, what was that? - What should we do?

507
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,120
My gosh.

508
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,200
My goodness.

509
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,320
Did he fall?

510
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,640
My goodness.

511
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,760
Did he jump off?

512
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
Hey, wake up.

513
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,400
My goodness, what happened?

514
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,720
My gosh, I can't believe this.

515
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,840
How did this happen?

516
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,960
I wonder if he's okay.

517
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,920
Move aside. The ambulance is going.

518
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,360
Stop the car.

519
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,560
You're the woman...

520
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,600
You scumbag.

521
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,800
- Open the trunk now! - What are you? Get off me!

522
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,240
Yes, sir. I took care of him.

523
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,200
How's she doing?

524
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,240
She was shocked, but everything else is normal.

525
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,480
Fortunately, he didn't do anything to her.

526
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,480
After knowing that Geon Young had come by,

527
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,120
he wasn't able to do anything because he became nervous.

528
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,240
That's a relief.

529
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,720
But why did he go for Eun Hye?

530
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,120
She was probably his target from the start.

531
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,480
Girls like Eun Hye can easily become...

532
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,400
targets of child molesters.

533
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,320
Her grandmother's ill, and she's intellectually disabled.

534
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,720
The assailants know that girls like her won't be able to report them...

535
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,960
or tell anyone about what happened.

536
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,360
I guess Geon Young...

537
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,640
was trying to protect Eun Hye.

538
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,240
Are you really not going to talk?

539
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,200
You're a mess.

540
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,840
What does he say?

541
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,360
I think what you told me was right.

542
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,720
Did he confess?

543
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,560
Did he say he was going to kill Geon Young...

544
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,880
because he's a witness?

545
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,040
Yes.

546
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,840
By the way, what did you tell the police?

547
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,440
Well...

548
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,040
I said you told me that you heard a child's voice...

549
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,040
coming out of his luggage bag while you were passing by,

550
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,360
and that's why I arrested him.

551
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,480
Did they believe that?

552
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,720
Of course. I'm a homicide detective.

553
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,960
If I told them that, they would've treated me like a crazy person.

554
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,000
I guess that's because you actually look like a crazy person.

555
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,320
My gosh, seriously.

556
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,200
Do you want me to show you what crazy really looks like?

557
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,680
Forget about that. It's all over now, right?

558
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,960
Let's go.

559
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,440
I can't believe this.

560
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,640
Where is he?

561
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,840
Excuse me.

562
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,320
Oh, hello. I heard about what you did.

563
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,120
Did you get seriously injured?

564
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,880
No, I'm fine.

565
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,160
What about Geon Young? Is he doing okay?

566
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,560
Yes, he's okay. Thankfully, his injury wasn't serious,

567
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,600
so I came here as soon as I took him back home.

568
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,680
I'm so relieved.

569
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,040
Geon Young's a really brave kid.

570
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,120
He did so much to save his friend.

571
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,400
Thank you so much.

572
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,960
If it weren't for you, he would've...

573
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,920
No, don't say that. You should go inside.

574
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Okay. Thank you.

575
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,760
Hey, you little...

576
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,240
How could you do that?

577
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,960
You dirty jerk.

578
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,960
How could you do that to them?

579
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,480
- Separate them. - My gosh.

580
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,760
- Don't do this to me. - You jerk. Seriously?

581
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,040
This isn't right.

582
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,800
It's all over now, right?

583
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,480
- Let's go. - Gosh, it hurts.

584
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,400
Stop exaggerating.

585
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,720
I'm not a culprit.

586
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,960
And what kind of man grabs a woman by the wrist like that?

587
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,240
Let's drop by Geon Young's place before we leave.

588
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,640
Why?

589
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,600
I want to check if that shadow is gone.

590
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,800
The culprit got arrested, so I'm sure it's gone.

591
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,880
I'm busy. Let's just go.

592
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,320
Then...

593
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
you can go to Seoul first.

594
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,880
I must see for myself to be at ease.

595
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,640
I'll see you at Seoul then.

596
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,480
Hey. Hey.

597
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,640
My gosh, I hate that human.

598
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,960
- Welcome. - Hello.

599
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,680
I came to see Geon Young.

600
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,160
Come inside, and have some tea.

601
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,760
No, it's okay. I must leave now.

602
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,320
Goodbye.

603
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,600
- Bye. - Bye.

604
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Let's go.

605
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,080
Thank you.

606
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,520
Forget it. Let's go now.

607
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,040
If it weren't for you, he would've gotten run over by that guy's car.

608
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,440
But how did you know where I was?

609
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,360
We're friends.

610
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,240
Oh, that's right.

611
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,720
You saved my account when we caught that guy.

612
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,880
You said you were too busy to help last night.

613
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,120
There's nothing more important than saving lives.

614
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,000
Thank you.

615
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,480
You may have lost your memory,

616
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,240
but you're still the same.

617
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,640
In what way?

618
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,720
You always did the right thing. You were really cool.

619
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,080
Me?

620
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,240
I was a bit cool today.

621
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
I was talking about back when you were young.

622
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,080
What? Then what about now?

623
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,680
Right now, you're...

624
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,520
What was that smirk about?

625
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,800
Why aren't you finishing your sentence?

626
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,520
I'll save it for next time.

627
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,840
I'll keep my eyes on you for a bit more.

628
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,560
What? Don't...

629
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,440
Don't keep your eyes on me. What do you mean by that?

630
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,280
How dare a human say that?

631
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,920
Right now, you've become a lot more handsome and cool.

632
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,160
Don't keep your eyes on me. I'm warning you.

633
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,120
I can't believe she said that. My gosh.

634
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,520
(Seoun Police Station)

635
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,600
Hey, Detective Park.

636
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,320
Hasn't the remaining part of this CCTV footage been restored yet?

637
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,760
Not yet. The footage itself is in very low quality.

638
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,120
My gosh.

639
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,400
Hurry up, and have this restored. Beat someone up if you must.

640
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,720
Okay.

641
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,080
Where are you going?

642
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,760
Gwang Gyun, can you please buy a new cell phone?

643
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,400
That thing always breaks down.

644
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,680
You use it for an hour, and charge it for two hours.

645
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,160
My gosh, you're the only person who doesn't use a smartphone.

646
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,880
Gosh, you're like an old man.

647
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,600
I missed a call from Jae Geun.

648
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,680
(Check voice message)

649
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,000
I must speak with you.

650
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,520
Let's talk in person.

651
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,760
What does he need to talk about with me?

652
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,120
Hey, Jae Geun. I noticed that you called me.

653
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,760
The owner of this phone got in an accident.

654
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,680
What? An accident?

655
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,200
This stop is Moojin Elementary School.

656
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,320
Moojin Elementary School.

657
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,560
Who are they?

658
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,640
What? Are we there already?

659
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,240
What? Wait.

660
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,720
Sir, wait. Please stop the bus.

661
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,200
Please stop the bus.

662
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,240
Joon, get off the bus now.

663
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,800
Where are you taking me again?

664
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,080
Come on. Just get off the bus.

665
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,160
Seriously.

666
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,800
Can't you remember this place?

667
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,200
It's Moojin Elementary School.

668
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,000
Do you remember? Can you remember this place?

669
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,960
It says Moojin Elementary School right here.

670
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,840
(Moojin Elementary School)

671
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,400
This place...

672
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,560
is where you and I went to school together.

673
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,560
Let's go inside.

674
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,880
You might be able to remember something.

675
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,240
(Moojin Elementary School)

676
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,240
My gosh, this place hasn't changed at all.

677
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,120
Back then, the schoolyard seemed to be as big as the Pacific Ocean.

678
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,760
But it seems very cute now.

679
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,480
That place over there...

680
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,160
is where we first met.

681
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,200
- She can see ghosts - She can see ghosts

682
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,520
- She can see ghosts - She can see ghosts

683
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,240
Seeing shadows beside people used to scare me so much...

684
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,440
that I always tried to keep my eyes fixed on the ground.

685
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,480
That's why I was always an outcast at school.

686
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,160
Hey, fortune-teller. Have you been waiting for us?

687
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,400
Why? Do you want to get beaten up again?

688
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,680
- Hey, what is that? - What is she wearing?

689
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,480
It looks ridiculous.

690
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,200
What is this?

691
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,360
Hey, don't do that.

692
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,840
What is he doing?

693
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,320
- Guys, let's go. - Come on.

694
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,600
- We'll see you later. - Gosh...

695
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,600
Kiddo, are you all right?

696
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,520
You have such pretty eyes.

697
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,160
Why do you keep covering your pretty eyes?

698
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,080
You're a student here, right?

699
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,840
I'm Kim Joon. I'm in sixth grade.

700
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,720
Do those boys bother you often?

701
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,400
Don't cry.

702
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,160
Do not let them think that you're an easy target.

703
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,640
Say this to them if they ever bother you again.

704
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,720
"You jerks. Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?"

705
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,640
"Shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?"

706
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,840
- Repeat after me. - What?

707
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,080
I'll say it again. Listen up, okay?

708
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,040
"You jerks. Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?"

709
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,120
"Shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?"

710
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,040
Hey, you...

711
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,920
I can't hear you. Say it louder.

712
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,240
"You jerks. Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?"

713
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,520
"Shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?"

714
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,760
Good. Curse at them like that if they bother you again.

715
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,920
Say it like a spell whenever you feel scared or afraid.

716
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,560
- Like a spell? - Yes.

717
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,360
That's right. Then whatever that's bothering you will look like a joke.

718
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,520
It'll look like a joke? All of them?

719
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,880
You must know how to protect yourself.

720
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,160
Try to look strong at all times.

721
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,840
Then no one will be able to bother you. Don't forget that.

722
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,600
Life works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?

723
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,240
You said that when we met again after 20 years...

724
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,920
What are you looking at?

725
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,240
Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?

726
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,240
Or shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?

727
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,400
Isn't it fascinating?

728
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,680
I said what you taught me when we met again.

729
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,560
Kim Joon taught you those absurd curse words?

730
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,280
Yes, you told me...

731
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,600
that whenever I feel scared or afraid,

732
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,640
I should say those words like a spell.

733
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,920
If I do so,

734
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,440
everything that's bothering me will look like a joke.

735
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,680
Then why do you curse all the time?

736
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,920
About that...

737
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,520
that's because they've been bothering me every second...

738
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,120
of every day for the last 20 years.

739
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,640
Who are they?

740
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,280
You mean the shadows that you see?

741
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,600
No, I meant people.

742
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,320
- Humans? - Wherever I went,

743
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,360
they would always whisper to each other in front of me...

744
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,800
and behind my back.

745
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,800
"That girl has eyes of a ghost."

746
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,960
"They're the eyes of a goblin."

747
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,520
I've seen ghosts and goblins myself.

748
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,120
Ghosts' eyes look duller than yours,

749
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,360
whereas goblins' eyes are much bigger than yours.

750
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,960
I think that your eyes are...

751
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,640
My eyes?

752
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,560
What about them?

753
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,240
They're deep,

754
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,880
brown, and...

755
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,640
They look different from other humans' eyes.

756
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,640
How should I put this? There's something special about them.

757
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,520
They're... They're special?

758
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,400
What... What makes you think that they're special?

759
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,520
Looking at them up close like this,

760
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,840
they look like eyes of a dog.

761
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,000
Eyes of a dog?

762
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,160
How dare you say such a thing?

763
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,240
Joon, Joon! Then your eyes are...

764
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,840
You have eyes of a doe.

765
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,000
Gosh, that sailor mouth.

766
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,960
So Kim Joon taught her to talk like that?

767
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,120
Joon, where are you going? Joon, Joon!

768
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,160
You two do so many absurd things together.

769
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,920
So? What did you guys bury inside?

770
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,520
What was in there?

771
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,920
Can't we dig it up?

772
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,000
No, we can't. I promised her we'll open it together 20 years later.

773
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,920
Just don't tell her.

774
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,240
I'll keep my lips sealed. Let's dig it up and see.

775
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,360
Shall we?

776
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,280
Joon!

777
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,240
What are you doing here? You took off after teasing me.

778
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,880
This is where we buried our time capsule.

779
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,240
I guess construction for the commemoration park hasn't begun yet.

780
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,840
Joon, do you remember?

781
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,120
We buried a time capsule here together.

782
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,720
Do you remember it now?

783
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,680
No. Don't.

784
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,400
Don't dig it up.

785
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,200
The day we promised to open it together...

786
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,200
is still a month away.

787
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,840
Keep the promise, okay?

788
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,240
There, it's covered now.

789
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,160
We should hurry.

790
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,160
Let's go.

791
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,880
Come on now. This way.

792
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,440
This place hasn't changed at all.

793
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,520
You used to live here as a kid.

794
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,640
Don't you remember?

795
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,200
- Come on. - Goodness.

796
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,880
That punk doesn't even respect me after everything I did to raise him.

797
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,240
It's not like I wanted to be born into a family like this.

798
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,640
Move out. Live on your own then. Don't you ever come back again.

799
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,320
- Stop it! - Why?

800
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,280
Gosh, I shouldn't have given birth to that punk.

801
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,960
I should've just aborted him.

802
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,920
Yes, why did you have me? I never wanted a mom like you.

803
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,760
What did you just say? That little...

804
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,760
Die, die!

805
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,120
You embarrass me!

806
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,200
I'm embarrassed of you.

807
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,360
I don't need a son like you. Die!

808
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,640
Just die! I want you to die!

809
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,160
- Joon... - Just die already.

810
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,880
Joon. Joon...

811
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,080
Right.

812
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,880
It's probably better to not remember this place.

813
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,360
We should get going, Joon.

814
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,160
- Let's dig it up and see. - Shall we?

815
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,240
What on earth is going on?

816
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,520
Why do I keep seeing flashbacks from Han Moo Gang's past?

817
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,120
No! No!

818
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,880
Stop the car.

819
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,160
Let's go.

820
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,360
Gosh, it hurts.

821
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,560
Stop exaggerating.

822
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,800
She must've thrown a fit because she was in pain.

823
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,520
She's such an odd human.

824
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,280
She's doing all this to save a complete stranger's life.

825
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,880
By the way, about this woman...

826
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,560
Why must she die?

827
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,000
Hey, what happened?

828
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,040
We'll need to investigate it further to find out about the details,

829
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,680
but I heard that he probably dozed off while driving.

830
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,400
There are no CCTV cameras in the vicinity,

831
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,840
and there aren't any witnesses either.

832
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,000
It'll be a difficult case.

833
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,200
I must speak with you. Let's talk in person.

834
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,240
Did he get into the accident on his way to meet me?

835
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,160
What did he want to talk about with me?

836
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,000
Hey, you made it. What is that?

837
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,120
They're the things that were in the commissioner general's car.

838
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,760
I brought them to give them to his wife.

839
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,080
- The car that was crashed? - Yes.

840
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,680
Just a moment, okay? This is...

841
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,440
Gwang Gyun, Gwang Gyun. Wait!

842
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,680
What are you doing now?

843
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
(Evidence)

844
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,560
What's he doing? Goodness.

845
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,560
(Santorini, Ask for Singing Pumpkin)

846
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,160
What's this? It's a bar.

847
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,560
Did he go to a bar alone?

848
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,880
Pumpkin?

849
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,000
Could this be Han Jin Sook's husband?

850
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,840
- Hey. - Yes.

851
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,040
Was this really found in the commissioner general's car?

852
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,320
Oh, yes.

853
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,840
It was caught in the sunroof of his car.

854
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,320
That can't be.

855
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,240
I'll be right back.

856
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,640
- Gwang Gyun! - Gwang Gyun!

857

(Pumpkin Singer)

863
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,480
How is this possible?

864
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,760
How can Clara's drawing...

865
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,200
be on Singing Pumpkin's business card?

866
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,640
Thanks, Joon.

867
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,600
Thanks to you, I was able to save Geon Young's life.

868
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,040
You have to go somewhere with me tomorrow.

869
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,160
Where?

870
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,480
We're going to find a person that has the shadow inside their body.

871
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,240
But I have to take care of what my boss asked me to do.

872
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,240
Saving lives is more important, isn't it?

873
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,080
Yes, it is. That is true.

874
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,080
Stop making excuses.

875
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,520
I just need you to check if you see the shadow or not, okay?

876
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,120
Okay, I will. Go in now.

877
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,640
Get some rest. I'll get going.

878
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,360
Gosh.

879
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,480
I'm okay. Seriously.

880
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,200
Gosh, this...

881
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,640
This is exactly why I painted this white.

882
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,000
Goodness, I can never pull this out either.

883
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,280
I'll get going.

884
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,320
She sure is clumsy.

885
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,080
How could she not see that?

886
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,720
She sure has dog eyes.

887
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,880
He pressed charges against them again after a small group...

888
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,880
of politicians criticized it as a sabotaging action.

889
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,880
Next news.

890
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,560
Kim, the man with French nationality who's been arrested for abducting...

891
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,440
and confining a disabled child in Moojin,

892
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,280
was actually indicted five years ago in France...

893
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,800
for sexually molesting children and possessing child pornography.

894
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,040
It's been revealed that he fled to Korea...

895
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,600
while he was being investigated by the French prosecution.

896
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,960
Just because he graduated from a renowned university in Paris,

897
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,000
no verification or certificates were required for him to...

898
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,880
What on earth have you done?

899
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,360
You went to stop her but ended up helping her save that boy's life.

900
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,160
How are you going to handle the consequences?

901
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,080
Don't you know what will happen...

902
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,920
when you meddle in humans' affairs?

903
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,560
I never meddled in anything.

904
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,920
You saved that kid's life.

905
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,120
I didn't save anyone's life.

906
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,360
I came to see Geon Young.

907
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,160
Goodbye.

908
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,280
- Bye. - Bye.

909
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
Let's go.

910
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:21,160
Does that mean he'll die like he's destined to be?

911
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,760
Of course.

912
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,000
That woman...

913
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,680
will never be able to save anyone's life.

914
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,120
I won't allow that.

915
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Never.

916
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,359
(Black)

917
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,200
What on earth are you doing here?

918
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,439
We got a call.

919
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:24,040
Someone is after Leo.

920
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,040
Who sent this?

921
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,040
No one can dare touch my Leo.

922
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,760
- Loser! - Joon! Joon!

923
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,720
He must've gotten his hands on that tape.

924
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,240
It's only a matter of time before he finds out who I really am.

925
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,000
Backup team. I'm requesting backup...

926
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,840
right now. Come immediately. You got that?

927
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,840
It's that jerk.

928
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,200
I must make sure that he can't bother me anymore.

929
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,279
How dare you, human.

930
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,319
Why did I remember it just now?
