1
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Hey, what is this?

2
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,240
(Episode 12)

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,400
It looks like a talisman of some sort.

4
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,920
Inspector Choi.

5
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,280
What do you think this is?

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,280
I'm not sure. I should test it first.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,800
Can't you tell right away?

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not a ghost.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,200
How does Moo Gang know it then?

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,360
Hey. What do you mean by the thing you said earlier?

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,840
It's the same way the director of the mental hospital was murdered?

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,039
Are you saying the person who killed the director killed this woman too?

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,120
Open it.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,200
The way she was murdered is the same as the director.

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,520
It's the same weapon, the same depth, and the same twist.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,800
What is it then?

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,400
Are you saying she was murdered because of a grudge?

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,920
There is a difference between the two deaths.

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,440
Yes.

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
There was no mentioning of a tape.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,720
What kind of tape is it that...

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,240
It's him, isn't it?

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,240
You and he schemed to lock me up in here, right?

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,280
He stabbed the director several times while avoiding vital spots.

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
You and that punk locked me up in here...

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,480
for 20 years.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,479
He enjoyed watching her be in pain...

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,120
and stabbed a vital spot at the end.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,680
He enjoyed watching her die slowly.

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,120
What is it?

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,040
What?

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,560
What is this?

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,040
Who are you?

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,800
What is this? What's going on?

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,880
On the other hand, he stabbed Lee Mi So's vital spot at once.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,680
With the director, he stabbed a vital spot at the end.

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,600
But he stabbed Lee Mi So's vital spot first and killed her.

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,320
He stabbed her in different places after that.

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
She probably wasn't in pain.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,680
So it's the same guy,

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,400
but he doesn't hold a grudge against Lee Mi So?

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
He's right. Here.

43
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,320
He stabbed her neck first.

44
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,520
This is the cause of her death.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,480
Is that so?

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,920
Ms. Lee Mi So was found dead in her car.

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,960
According to the witness, the suspect had bandages on his hand...

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,800
and a scar on his face.

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
A scar?

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,680
No way. A lot of people have scars on their faces.

51
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,440
Don't try to change people's fate carelessly.

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,920
Remember what I said.

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,920
You won't be able to bear the consequence.

54
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
No way. It wouldn't be him.

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,520
It wouldn't be him.

56
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,280
He has no reason to kill an actress.

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
Welcome.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,240
I'm looking for a person who had a meal here and signed like this.

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,560
Do you remember this?

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,840
We get many customers. I don't remember everyone's signature.

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,360
It's also two months ago.

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,480
May I see the security camera footage on this date?

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,560
I really have to find this person.

64
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,440
We don't have security cameras here.

65
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Moo Gang. Did you go to Chuncheon?

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
What?

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
Yes, for an investigation.

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,560
This isn't your signature. Whose is it?

69
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,440
It's someone who helps me with work...

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
like an operative. We had a meal, and that person signed it.

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,400
What's the case?

72
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,200
Actually,

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,880
it's the hit-and-run accident of my brother.

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,880
I'm investigating it.

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm sure this person...

76
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
knows where the tape is.

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,280
I have to find it before they do.

78
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,680
That's the only way I can protect Moo Gang.

79
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,920
Gosh, let him go already. I have to take him outside.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,560
Even if he stays here, the loser won't come in here.

81
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,840
All right. This is our case now.

82
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,120
We got a new identikit of the suspect of the asylum murder case.

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,600
- Here. Take a look. - What?

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,040
Darn it.

85
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,440
What is this? Gosh.

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,320
Why does he suddenly have a scar on his face?

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,520
You're pulling all kinds of tricks to steal our cases now.

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,480
It was on the news that the one who killed Lee Mi So had a scar.

89
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,680
The hospital staff changed her statement.

90
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,920
That's absolute nonsense.

91
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,960
When we went to back you up, no one said anything about a scar.

92
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,040
Don't try to fool us.

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,400
Someone did tell me.

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,640
Someone told me...

95
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,800
that the suspect had a scar on his face.

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,640
I forgot to say this earlier because of the mess,

97
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
but that patient...

98
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,040
had a scar on his face shaped like a hook.

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
Why are you telling us that now?

100
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,960
Didn't I tell you before?

101
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
No, you didn't.

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,760
That's why I said it's the same guy who killed the hospital director.

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
What on earth have you been investigating all this time?

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
It happened a long time ago, and the identikit isn't even right.

105
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,640
Do you think this is a common scar?

106
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,760
If you had found it out sooner, we could've stopped additional murder.

107
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,680
Don't you try to lay the blame on us.

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,880
The nurse told Moo Gang about the scar.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,680
It all happened because that lunatic didn't tell anyone about it.

110
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
"Lunatic"? How dare you...

111
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
- call him that? - Gosh, stop.

112
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,160
- Let go of me! - Captain Bong!

113
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,720
- How dare you! - Please stop.

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,200
- I'm going to kill you! - Stop, Captain Bong.

115
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,640
I saw him.

116
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,920
You jerks!

117
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,960
I saw him. Hey! I said I saw him!

118
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
Yes. I remember this scar.

119
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,480
It was my first day working with him.

120
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,240
He came to my office and asked for work.

121
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,159
He was short, but his figure, eyes, and nose seemed strong.

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,440
I thought he'd do a good job.

123
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,159
Did he know that you were going to Moojin?

124
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Yes. He knew it when he came.

125
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,240
He even checked it with me several times.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
- Is that so? - Yes.

127
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
(Interrogation Room)

128
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,960
Hi. Please don't worry. Our team is on the case now.

129
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,440
Also, I think the one who chained the container is him. Yes.

130
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,400
I checked it myself.

131
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay.

132
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,840
Excuse me.

133
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,000
What did he say? Does he know where the suspect is?

134
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,960
What kind of a murderer lets people know where he is?

135
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,760
He must've run away already.

136
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,240
I shouldn't have saved his life. Why am I so meddlesome?

137
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,799
If you want to pull your hair out, you should pull harder.

138
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,880
Leo... What is Leo doing here?

139
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,240
He will be filming a drama about detectives or something.

140
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,159
He's following me around to study his character.

141
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,600
I guess I'm the best detective there is.

142
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,120
It's the drama that the writer who tried to die at the rooftop wrote.

143
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,160
Oh, is it the one she wrote?

144
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,200
I just thought it's unfair that...

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,400
the filthy idiots in this field are trampling on a weak person together.

146
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
I have some power, so I backed her up a little.

147
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,640
That's good news.

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,160
Wait.

149
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,520
It's him.

150
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,200
The person I saw at the broadcasting station.

151
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,080
That scar on his face.

152
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
When that writer was trying...

153
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
to throw herself off the rooftop of the broadcasting station,

154
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,920
he almost died by having her fall on him.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,040
You shouldn't be here. You'll die if you stay here.

156
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
Move to that side now.

157
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
That's right.

158
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,320
The security camera there might have caught him.

159
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,080
- Let's go now. - That's enough.

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
Do you think you're a detective?

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,120
He's already on the wanted list, and the police started investigating.

162
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
You should just wait without doing anything.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
But...

164
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Look at yourself.

165
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,560
You're injured everywhere by trying to save people's lives.

166
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,600
You will get yourself killed if you keep doing this.

167
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,240
He's a brutal serial killer.

168
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,040
How can someone like you catch someone like that?

169
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,000
What then? Do you want me to just sit back and watch?

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,600
It'd still be distressing to just wait without doing anything.

171
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,280
If I hadn't saved his life twice,

172
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,760
Lee Mi So wouldn't have died.

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,600
He may be killing another person somewhere even at this moment.

174
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,040
Let's go. Please.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,960
Fine. Let's go.

176
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Let's go. Lead the way. Go.

177
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
What does that mean?

178
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,320
She saved his life twice?

179
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,400
What should we do?

180
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
It's not showing his face.

181
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm sure it's him.

182
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,680
Was that dead girl also at the broadcasting station on that day?

183
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Yes, she was.

184
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,360
She was the host of the music show Leo performed in that day.

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,560
So he didn't pick an imported car because he needed money.

186
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,480
Look at it here.

187
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
He's hanging around. It looks like he was waiting for someone.

188
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
Oh, it sort of looks like that now that I'm looking at it again.

189
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,000
Then let's check if Lee Mi So...

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,920
came to the broadcasting station on any other days.

191
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,320
I'll look into that.

192
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,120
I'm close with her manager.

193
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,680
Thanks so much, Leo.

194
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,400
I deserve that too.

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,080
I found out everything too.

196
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,720
Gosh, what on earth happened?

197
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,280
There's nothing notable. Why did they wipe all the data from 1997?

198
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,920
Goodness, Oh Man Ho sure covered his tracks very well.

199
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,160
30 million dollars?

200
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,280
That is a lot of money. Where did they send 30 million dollars?

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
What is this bank account?

202
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,760
Hold on a second. Look. He's back.

203
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,880
It seems certain now.

204
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,280
Like you said, Lee Mi So didn't get killed randomly.

205
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,160
It must've been premeditated.

206
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,320
What should we do though?

207
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,640
Even here, his face wasn't caught on camera.

208
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
He must know the exact locations of all the CCTV cameras.

209
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,640
He purposely avoided his face getting caught on any of them.

210
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,880
Wouldn't his face have been caught on the car's dashboard camera?

211
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,280
Who's in that car?

212
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,400
I think whoever was in that car probably saw him.

213
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,840
Was it Lee Mi So's manager?

214
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,080
But her manager wouldn't get her behind the building so secretly.

215
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,920
Oh, could it be her backer?

216
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,280
When I ran into her at the club,

217
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,120
she told me that she loves someone now.

218
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,040
From my experience, I know that fans can turn into stalkers...

219
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,000
when something like that gets disclosed.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,320
I think it was a stalker's doing.

221
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,520
What? Han Moo Gang?

222
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
What are you doing here?

223
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,040
The person who killed Lee Mi So. We think it's him.

224
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,880
- What? - Please have a look at this.

225
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,120
His face must've been caught on this car's dashboard camera.

226
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,840
It's possible that the driver of this car saw the killer's face.

227
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,000
We must...

228
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,240
identify that person first.

229
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,880
Find footage that shows this car from a different angle.

230
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,640
Let's see if the license plate was caught at least.

231
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,880
How is it possible that nothing was caught?

232
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,760
This is ridiculous.

233
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,680
I'll look into it. Moo Gang and all of you should get out now.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,760
Don't go snooping around in our cases from now on!

235
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
Let's go.

236
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,520
Come on.

237
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
Those rats...

238
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
(Security Management Office)

239
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
I should get going.

240
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,280
I have a costume fitting booked for my new drama.

241
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm certain that the loser is somewhere around that jerk.

242
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,520
I'll get to that after helping Ha Ram with her urgent matters.

243
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,960
It wasn't your fault.

244
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,760
I prevented his death twice,

245
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,240
and someone died as a result.

246
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,320
You didn't know that he was a murderer.

247
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,400
So just leave it up to the police to catch him.

248
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,600
But what if he kills another person?

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,720
His face could've been caught on CCTV cameras in the vicinity,

250
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,360
so I'll look into it more before I leave.

251
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,640
Ha Ram...

252
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,640
Gosh... That human. Seriously.

253
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
I barely managed to shake off the guards.

254
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
What?

255
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,240
Dad.

256
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,520
Dad, you can watch TV on your own now.

257
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,960
Dad, I came to see you because I had a question to ask.

258
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,560
This. I found this in one of the reports from 1997.

259
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,800
Do you know what this is?

260
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,320
(Send 30 million dollars, 110-312-250850)

261
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,200
You know what it is, don't you?

262
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,480
What's this about? What was the money for? And whose account is it?

263
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,600
I went through all the documents,

264
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,080
but there was nothing about this bank account.

265
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,320
Also, it looks like someone wiped all the data from 1997.

266
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,120
It sounds strange to you too, right?

267
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,800
Dad, do you know anything about this?

268
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,200
Don't do anything useless.

269
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,640
It's Man Ho, isn't it?

270
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,640
He must've done something bad with this money.

271
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,240
You probably can't say anything because you want to protect him.

272
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,480
Man Soo.

273
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
I bet you don't like seeing this...

274
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,200
going on between us brothers.

275
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,000
I would've turned a blind eye to everything and acted...

276
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,640
as if everything was fine if he hadn't done that to Sip Gyeon,

277
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,000
but it's too late now.

278
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,440
I cannot forgive him.

279
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,400
Forget it if you don't want to tell me. I'll find out on my own.

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,200
The key.

281
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,920
Man Soo.

282
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,480
There's a key...

283
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,240
inside the safe in my room.

284
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,440
Bring it to me immediately.

285
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
What's the key for?

286
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,320
I'll tell you when the right time comes.

287
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
The password...

288
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,320
It's... It's your date of birth.

289
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,120
- Okay, Dad. - The police are openly searching...

290
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
for a suspected serial killer.

291
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,880
It's been revealed that the suspect in Actress Lee Mi So's murder...

292
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,160
is the man who is suspected of killing...

293
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,520
the director of the mental hospital in Yangju recently.

294
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
The suspect has a scar on the right side of his face, and...

295
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,920
- How far will you take this? - his height is presumed to be...

296
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,160
How far are you going to go? You fool.

297
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,000
If Man Soo is put in danger,

298
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,520
I'll never forgive you.

299
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,520
What's going on?

300
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,720
How did you get in?

301
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,960
Has this jerk ever come to see you?

302
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,960
Who is that man?

303
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,720
He's the one...

304
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,040
who killed the madam 20 years ago.

305
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,400
I got him locked up in a mental hospital,

306
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,480
but he escaped and has been causing trouble ever since.

307
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,720
If he does come to see you,

308
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,160
do whatever you can to buy time, and call me right away.

309
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,360
Because his modus operandi is cruel,

310
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,680
and it's possible that he might commit additional crimes for money,

311
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,040
the police have decided to openly search for...

312
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,480
I just escaped from a mental hospital,

313
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,760
so you'll have to help me.

314
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,200
I was totally surprised. Who knew you'd become a doctor?

315
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,920
And you're Han Moo Gang's girlfriend.

316
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,920
Answer me.

317
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,840
How on earth do you know Moo Gang?

318
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,600
Han Moo Gang?

319
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,560
That boyfriend of yours came to see me at the mental hospital...

320
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,280
and asked me about his brother.

321
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,920
Back then, I was in pretty bad shape,

322
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,240
so he told me not to take my medication.

323
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,200
He said he'd come back, but he never did.

324
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,600
That's why I got out of the hospital on my own.

325
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,480
You must keep your promise.

326
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Do not show up in front of me ever again, and stay away from Moo Gang.

327
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,640
Don't you worry.

328
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,720
He'll be fine as long as he doesn't interfere with what I'm doing.

329
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,600
I won't forget that you helped me out this time.

330
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,040
Just keep your eyes wide open, and watch...

331
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,280
how I slowly kill that scumbag.

332
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,720
Look forward to it, Kim Sun Young.

333
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,520
No way.

334
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,520
Moo Gang won't investigate the case, right?

335
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,120
(Confirmation of Life Insurance Payment)

336
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,520
Wang Young Choon...

337
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,000
The man who killed Ha Ram's dad?

338
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,520
Why is Dad keeping this in his safe?

339
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,200
Thank goodness.

340
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
I guess Moo Gang's team isn't handling his case.

341
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,200
Who is on their side?

342
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,280
Hey. Are you really not going to control that lunatic on your team?

343
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,440
Why are you picking a fight again?

344
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,680
He's snooping around everywhere to catch the one who killed Lee Mi So!

345
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,560
Tell him to stay out of our case!

346
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,200
Moo Gang is...

347
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,480
investigating his case?

348
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,440
- Hi, Ms. Fortune-teller. - You said you can trace anything.

349
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,720
Could you find out what Lee Mi So has been up to?

350
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,800
Lee Mi So?

351
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,520
The one who got murdered?

352
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,000
- Why? - A man I saved twice...

353
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,200
- seems like the one who killed her. - What?

354
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,360
I was wondering if he and she were related in any way.

355
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,960
I'm looking into it with Detective Han, but we haven't found anything.

356
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,440
- Could you help us? - Okay. I'll try.

357
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,600
All right.

358
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,080
Lee Mi So?

359
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,000
Who is that?

360
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,480
Can I help you with something?

361
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,240
Who...

362
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,960
What?

363
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,600
Aren't you the prettiest doctor at Royeol Hospital?

364
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,520
Who are you?

365
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,720
Here, please drink this.

366
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,880
Do you know where Moo Gang is?

367
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,960
He's not answering his phone.

368
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,280
He seemed busy chasing a killer with Ms. Fortune-teller.

369
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,280
Miss... What?

370
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Sorry?

371
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,280
Don't you know Ms. Fortune-teller?

372
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,600
She's Detective Han's friend from his hometown,

373
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,280
who often wears sunglasses.

374
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,520
She's a great fortuneteller.

375
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,200
She's such a talented fortuneteller that...

376
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,560
she can see if someone will die soon.

377
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,800
She's been saving people's lives,

378
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,320
but one of the people she's saved...

379
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,880
turned out to be the man...

380
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,680
who killed Lee Mi So.

381
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
What?

382
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,160
She's someone who'd run wildly to catch him herself.

383
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,920
That's probably why Detective Han is tagging along with her.

384
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,320
She should just leave it to the police.

385
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,720
By the way, why is that girl wearing sunglasses?

386
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,720
Her eyes are special.

387
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,840
- "Special"? - Yes.

388
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
She can see death. She knows how someone will die.

389
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,280
No way.

390
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,720
It's true. I didn't believe it either, but it was true.

391
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,840
What?

392
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,800
Are you saying...

393
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,440
Moo Gang is chasing after that killer...

394
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,680
because of that woman?

395
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,400
Yes. Detective Han does everything she asks for.

396
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,200
Oh, please... Please don't misunderstand.

397
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,880
He's with her because of work and nothing else.

398
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,040
They're not in any romantic relationship.

399
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,560
I'm sorry, but could you get me some more coffee?

400
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Sure.

401
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,520
Wait. What about... What about the coffee?

402
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,200
I can't believe not a single camera caught him.

403
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,440
He's meticulous.

404
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,360
He didn't even leave any traces at the mental hospital either.

405
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,440
I'll call you after checking if they made any progress at the office.

406
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
Thank you, Joon.

407
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,720
Call me.

408
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,640
I have to keep them apart...

409
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,520
to make sure Moo Gang is safe.

410
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,520
Maybe I shouldn't have saved anyone's life.

411
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,480
What brings you to my house?

412
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,920
I thought I should tell you this.

413
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,760
What is it?

414
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,920
Moo Gang...

415
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,440
isn't Joon.

416
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,520
I'm sorry?

417
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,840
Kim Joon, your first love.

418
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,480
It's not Moo Gang. It's his brother.

419
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,040
Han Moo Chan. He's Moo Gang's stepbrother.

420
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,080
I don't understand.

421
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,120
I've never seen him in person,

422
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,160
but Moo Gang once told me...

423
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,360
that he had a brother from Moojin.

424
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,280
His name was Kim Joon,

425
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,800
but they changed it...

426
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,320
to Han Moo Chan because he wanted to have his dad's last name.

427
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,280
What happened to Joon then?

428
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,880
Where is he now?

429
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,680
I heard...

430
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,360
he died a long time ago.

431
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,040
He... He died?

432
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,000
Did you just say...

433
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,360
Joon died?

434
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,520
At Moo Gang's place the other day,

435
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
you called him Joon.

436
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,320
I thought it was strange, so I asked him.

437
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,280
He said he hid it from you on purpose.

438
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,120
He said he wants to use you for his investigation,

439
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
but you wouldn't help him if you found out the truth.

440
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,760
He also asked me...

441
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,200
to pretend not to know and not tell you.

442
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,200
I'm... I'm sorry.

443
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,040
This is why I couldn't tell you then,

444
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,080
but I was worried about you.

445
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,040
No. He...

446
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,040
even wears the bracelet I gave him.

447
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,520
He's wearing it because it's a keepsake from his late brother.

448
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,280
That's what he told me.

449
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,920
He still has the face he had when he was little.

450
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,360
It just doesn't make sense.

451
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,480
They're brothers.

452
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,840
They look very much alike.

453
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,920
I can't believe not one of them knows where Kim Sun Young is.

454
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,320
Is she even alive?

455
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,120
But why is that brat hovering around them all night?

456
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,280
Goodness! Get off me!

457
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,880
Hey, get off me!

458
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,040
- Are you crazy? - Yes. Come here.

459
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,800
Let go of me!

460
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,920
Are you on their team?

461
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,200
Why are you so interested in their case like a beggar?

462
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,360
Don't you have any pride?

463
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,080
Try to catch the one who killed Han Jin Sook instead.

464
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,320
We need to get some results too.

465
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,040
My gosh, he's sulky again.

466
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,360
Hey. Did you think about the thing I told you about?

467
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,080
- What? - You little...

468
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,120
I'm talking about the skeleton!

469
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,520
Why did you hide it? Why did you go to Moojin Girls' Middle School?

470
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,760
I can't remember.

471
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,960
You brat.

472
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,280
Is there a politician in your family?

473
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,200
You can't remember? Is that the best you can do?

474
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,680
You have to remember it!

475
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,520
Joon.

476
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,080
What is it? We haven't found anything yet.

477
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,960
- I said I'll call you if we do. - Can I talk to you?

478
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,760
I know you're worried. I'll call you if we find something.

479
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,360
Joon.

480
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,200
What?

481
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,600
"What"?

482
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,520
How despicable.

483
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,240
My Joon.

484
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,480
Is he really dead?

485
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,040
Did he really die?

486
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,800
- Well... - Is he dead or not?

487
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,280
Yes, apparently.

488
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,800
You mean jerk.

489
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,720
What did he do wrong to get slapped by her like that?

490
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,920
My gosh, he must've gotten himself into trouble.

491
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,680
What?

492
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,600
My gosh.

493
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
This boy...

494
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,200
- Hey. - Here.

495
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,880
It's him.

496
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,120
But why does Moo Gang have a photo of this boy?

497
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,800
Moo Gang?

498
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,360
What's he doing here?

499
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,920
Moo Gang went there that day to meet him.

500
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,240
Which hospital did Moo Gang's mother work at?

501
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,880
Do you know him?

502
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,560
No.

503
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,400
It's just an identikit, so it's not perfectly correct.

504
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,000
But he has a hook-shaped scar on his right cheek.

505
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,600
I've never seen this man before.

506
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,520
But who is he?

507
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,400
Well, he's a mental patient who recently killed someone...

508
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,960
and escaped from the mental hospital.

509
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
We're assuming that he could've killed someone else last night too.

510
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,200
What?

511
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,880
Right before this guy escaped from the mental hospital,

512
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
it seemed like he was trying...

513
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,880
to get rid of this by burning it and throwing it in the toilet.

514
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,800
But thankfully, we were able to find it.

515
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,960
Why... Why did he have a photo of Moo Chan?

516
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,840
That's what I was curious about.

517
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,640
I think Detective Han went to see him, showed him this photo,

518
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,200
and left it there before having lost his memory...

519
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,440
due to the accident.

520
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,440
- What? - It's just my assumption.

521
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,880
I think he was in the middle of...

522
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,840
investigating something by himself before he had lost his memory.

523
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,480
Do you remember anything from back then?

524
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,880
I think he also went to Moojin a couple of times.

525
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,120
"Moojin"?

526
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,800
Yes. Do you know what it could've been about?

527
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,720
Yes. That's where his older brother got into an accident.

528
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,840
Really?

529
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,920
Yes.

530
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,800
I had to attend a seminar in Moojin,

531
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,920
and the kids didn't have to go to school that day,

532
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,480
so I took them with me to Moojin.

533
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,720
Rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors.

534
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,240
Rock-paper-scissors.

535
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Hey, you guys. Look outside.

536
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,720
Let's take a photo here.

537
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,560
Look over here, you two. Put your arms around each other.

538
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,000
Look here.

539
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,840
(April 16th, 1997)

540
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,920
I heard you were going to attend the seminar.

541
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,600
Long time no see, Doctor Min.

542
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,480
It feels like yesterday when you used to be my intern.

543
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,280
How is it being a resident? It's hard, isn't it?

544
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,760
No, it's okay. I'll get going now.

545
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,520
What? Wait.

546
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,199
Hello?

547
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,880
Hey, Moo Gang. What were you doing?

548
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,880
I see. I'll be there as soon as I'm done with my seminar,

549
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,159
so have fun with your brother...

550
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,320
By the way,

551
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,840
ask your brother to take you around Moojin.

552
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,440
I'll see you later.

553
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,679
Excuse me. What happened?

554
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,800
Didn't you see the news?

555
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,120
- Moojin Time Mart just collapsed. - What?

556
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,080
Casualties from the collapse of Moojin Time Mart kept coming in.

557
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,360
And there was a shortage of doctors.

558
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,040
So I ended up working at the hospital for four days straight.

559
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,880
I couldn't take care of my children for days like that.

560
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,240
Then I got a call in the middle of the night from an unknown number.

561
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,280
Hello?

562
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,200
Yes, I'm Moo Chan's mother...

563
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,800
Moo Chan got into a car accident?

564
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,840
This photo ended up...

565
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,680
being Moo Chan's last photo.

566
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,640
What kind of accident was it?

567
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,640
It was a hit-and-run accident. We couldn't catch who it was.

568
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,280
I see. I'm sorry.

569
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,640
Then that means Detective Han's brother died...

570
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,480
four days after the collapse...

571
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,320
of Moojin Time Mart. Is that correct?

572
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
Yes.

573
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,240
I got a call exactly at dawn, just when it was about to...

574
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,800
become the fifth day.

575
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,640
I see.

576
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,080
Okay, I'll call you if I have any other questions.

577
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,720
Thank you.

578
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,600
Nice.

579
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,480
What is this?

580
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,880
What got into him?

581
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,000
Humans tend to do stuff to forget about...

582
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,600
their worries and stress.

583
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,600
He's following exactly what humans do.

584
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,840
That's because he used to be human.

585
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,520
Hey, you're here.

586
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,560
Do you want me to show you something nice?

587
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,480
Come here. Come on.

588
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,040
Come on.

589
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,840
How do they look?

590
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,160
I used all of Moo Gang's credit cards.

591
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,200
How do they look? They look nice, don't they?

592
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
It's here. It's finally here.

593
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,240
I love intestine soup.

594
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,320
Gosh, it tastes great.

595
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,000
I feel sorry for you. You can't taste something so delicious.

596
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,080
Are you really okay?

597
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,240
That lady said she's never going to see you again.

598
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,320
At first, I was worried that...

599
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,080
I won't be able to find that loser without her help.

600
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,520
But come to think of it, she's of no help at all.

601
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,920
She gets nothing done properly.

602
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,400
I figured that she's just a huge burden to me.

603
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,040
And who am I?

604
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,600
I'm 444.

605
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,240
I can find that loser even without the help of a mere human being.

606
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,720
Did you really...

607
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,800
stick by her side solely because of that loser?

608
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,280
What?

609
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,320
Why else would I have stayed by her side?

610
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,320
Whatever. I'm tired. Go away.

611
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,040
Get lost.

612
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,520
What? You want me to get lost?

613
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,520
How can you say that to me? I have nowhere to go right now.

614
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,560
Hey, I wasn't talking to you right now.

615
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,480
Are you kidding me? Then who were you talking to?

616
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,280
There's no one else in this room but me.

617
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,600
You're so mean.

618
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I even put my issues behind me...

619
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,920
so that I could help you and Ms. Fortune-teller...

620
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,440
find that murderer.

621
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,360
What?

622
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,080
I'm not looking for him anymore, so don't talk about her in front of me.

623
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Wait.

624
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,600
But how did you know that we were looking for him?

625
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
What?

626
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,040
Did she come here?

627
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,880
Did she take a photo or something?

628
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,600
No. She told me about the case over the phone.

629
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,120
By the way, your fiancee came to see you.

630
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,920
I think she took something from the drawer.

631
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,600
What?

632
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,440
I knew it. I knew it was that human doctor.

633
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,320
My gosh, I shouldn't have trusted that human doctor.

634
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,720
What's his problem? Why would he call his own fiancee a human doctor?

635
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,920
He's so weird. He's not normal at all.

636
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,840
He's mean and arrogant.

637
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,640
My Joon.

638
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,720
Is he really dead?

639
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,360
Did he really die?

640
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,600
Oh, right. It was the day when they found...

641
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,000
Woo Byung Sik's body.

642
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,720
We never saw Clara and Sun Young after that day.

643
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,080
Jin Sook also disappeared after that.

644
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,440
The body was found on April 19th, 1997.

645
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,840
Let's see.

646
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,760
Clara, Han Jin Sook, and Kim Sun Young all disappeared...

647
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,320
in the evening of April 19th, 1997.

648
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,200
And Moo Gang's older brother's corpse was found...

649
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,160
the next day at 4am on April 20th.

650
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,480
Clara was found dead in this factory.

651
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,640
And Moo Gang's brother was found dead on this road,

652
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,880
which is only 1.1km away from the factory.

653
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,360
1.1km.

654
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,000
It's either a 1 minute drive or a 10 minute walk.

655
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,160
Is this Moojin Police Station?

656
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,200
Hey, Detective Choi. It's me.

657
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,040
Please do me a favor.

658
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,240
If you look through the statute-barred cases,

659
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,760
you'll be able to find a hit-and-run accident that happened...

660
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,920
around 4am on April 20, 1997.

661
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,040
The victim's name is Han Moo Chan, and his original name is Kim Joon.

662
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,680
Can you send me the investigation files via email right now?

663
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,680
Okay. Thank you.

664
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm sure...

665
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,000
these two cases are correlated with each other.

666
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,440
That's why Detective Han looked into both cases at once.

667
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,680
But why did he go to Hope Mental Hospital?

668
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,880
Does this guy...

669
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,200
also have something to do with Clara and Kim Joon's death?

670
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,720
A planned murder?

671
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,040
Ms. Fortune-teller.

672
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,520
Let's go see Joon.

673
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,160
Let go of me. He's not Joon.

674
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,440
I'm talking about the real Joon.

675
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,160
(Han Moo Chan)

676
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,720
(Han Moo Chan)

677
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,040
Joon.

678
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,160
That jerk...

679
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,720
knew that Joon's ashes were kept here.

680
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,160
(Han Moo Chan)

681
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,560
(Han Moo Chan)

682
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
I didn't even know you were here.

683
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,280
I had no idea.

684
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,600
I prayed so much that I'd be able to meet you.

685
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,840
But I was stupid enough...

686
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,000
to think that someone else was you.

687
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,120
I was foolishly mistaken.

688
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,800
Why did you have to die like this too?

690
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,720
Even my dad's dead.

691
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,400
Why did you die?

692
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,120
Why caused...

693
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,920
Joon's death?

694
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,440
Well...

695
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,680
Hey, wake up.

696
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,760
Gosh, why?

697
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,240
Leave me alone when I sleep.

698
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
You need to take Ha Ram somewhere.

699
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,240
Where?

700
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,480
Take her to Kim Joon.

701
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,760
It was a hit-and-run accident. They failed to catch the culprit.

702
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,600
The truth will hurt her, so just tell her that it was an accident.

703
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,880
Apparently, he was in a car accident.

704
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,680
I didn't even know that.

705
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,880
I feel so ashamed and apologetic.

706
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,280
Why do you feel that way? You missed him so much.

707
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,760
What's the use? I didn't even recognize him properly.

708
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,440
I mistook someone else as Joon.

709
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,200
I feel like Joon must've been...

710
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,080
completely dumbfounded.

711
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,720
I'm not going to let that jerk get away with this.

712
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,000
He fooled me and took advantage of me.

713
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,600
I can never forgive him for that.

714
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,680
I'm sure he didn't fool you on purpose.

715
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,160
He lost his memory because of the accident.

716
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,760
So he probably thought he was Joon at first...

717
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,320
because you kept calling him that.

718
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,520
Let's say he did.

719
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,360
But he found out the truth later on.

720
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,360
He kept lying to me even when he knew that he wasn't Joon.

721
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,200
He pretended like he was Joon.

722
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,240
Although he found out,

723
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,480
he probably missed the right timing to tell you.

724
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,160
It must've been hard for him to keep lying to you as well.

725
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,320
No.

726
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,560
That jerk took advantage of me.

727
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
How is she?

728
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,760
Don't worry. She visited Kim Joon.

729
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,600
I'll take her back safely.

730
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,560
- Hey. - Yes?

731
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,600
Thank you.

732
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,880
I can't believe this arrogant jerk just thanked me.

733
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,720
- What? - Aren't you going to come to work?

734
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,240
I'm sick.

735
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,680
Cut that nonsense. Get over here right now.

736
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,200
Your older brother's birth mother's here.

737
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,880
You better get over here right now.

738
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,440
Detective Han.

739
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,560
What's this smell?

740
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,680
What is it?

741
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,240
I came in the middle of delivering fish.

742
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,320
I should've gotten changed.

743
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,160
She's your older brother's birth mother.

744
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,720
She's Kim Joon's mother?

745
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,480
Detective Han?

746
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,520
Who are you? Do you know me?

747
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
No. I must've mistaken you for someone else.

748
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,040
What are you doing? Sit down.

749
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,080
I want you to listen to what she has to say.

750
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,120
Then tell me right away if there's anything you remember. Okay?

751
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,320
You're Han Moo Chan's birth mother, right?

752
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,520
He's your son, right?

753
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,760
My baby.

754
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,120
My poor baby.

755
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
I'm sorry.

756
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,080
Was Joon raised by his father?

757
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,240
I raised him at first.

758
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,920
But there was a situation.

759
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,160
Search every single corner!

760
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,560
What are you doing?

761
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,920
We received a report.

762
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,360
What report? What report?

763
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,280
Why are you going through my child's room?

764
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,560
Let me go.

765
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,400
- Let me go! - You can't be like this.

766
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,440
That's mine.

767
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,280
I put it in there.

768
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,280
- Arrest her. - Yes, sir.

769
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,920
Ma'am.

770
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,120
No! No!

771
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,680
Let me go! Let go of me! No, you can't go.

772
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,040
- What are you doing? - Joon.

773
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,200
Why are you taking my mom?

774
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,320
She's been charged for possessing drugs. Get out of the way.

775
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,320
- Joon. - Ma'am, no!

776
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,840
- Joon. - You even do drugs now?

777
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,440
Don't even call my name anymore.

778
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,200
I'm so embarrassed of you!

779
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,720
Joon, how can you say that to her?

780
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,840
- My gosh. - What's going on?

781
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,360
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly like this.

782
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,560
I couldn't think of...

783
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,240
anywhere else to send Joon.

784
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,640
It must've been shocking news to you.

785
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,160
It did surprise me a little.

786
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,680
By the way, how did Professor Han pass away?

787
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,360
He passed away...

788
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,720
from heart disease last year.

789
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,600
- I'm sorry. I had no idea. - Don't worry.

790
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,760
Joon...

791
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,960
I'll look after him.

792
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,120
But a few days before I was released,

793
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,520
I heard that Joon died.

794
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,680
Why did you tell the police that the accident was a premeditated murder...

795
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,600
and not a simple hit-and-run case?

796
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,720
Well...

797
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,600
What is this?

798
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,160
It was found in Joon's backpack,

799
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,600
which he was wearing on the day of the accident.

800
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,320
These are... Aren't these pens?

801
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,240
No, they're not. What should I call them?

802
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,240
They're some sort of smoke bombs.

803
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,960
- Smoke bombs? - Yes.

804
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,720
There was a detective Joon was very fond of like his own dad.

805
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,640
Joon used to hang out with punks and misbehave himself,

806
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,760
but he changed after meeting that detective, so I was very happy.

807
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,120
All right. It's done.

808
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,720
It just looks like a pen.

809
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,960
Are you saying pressing it will make the smoke bomb go off?

810
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,040
Of course.

811
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,440
It's true.

812
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,920
Daddy said that he's making those bombs so that his station...

813
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,800
can distribute them to residents for emergency situations.

814
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,480
All right. The red pen...

815
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,960
should be pressed when there's a fire.

816
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,480
The yellow one is for when someone is trying to harm you.

817
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,480
Press it in such situations.

818
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And use this green one...

819
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,960
when you're feeling ill.

820
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,080
Joon made the yellow one go off by mistake that day,

821
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,720
so I spent the rest of the day trying to get rid of the smoke.

822
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
What is this?

823
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,840
That's why I remember it clearly. The yellow smoke bomb.

824
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,960
I'm certain of it. The pen was already used.

825
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,680
That's when I became convinced.

826
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,480
If Joon made the yellow bomb go off,

827
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,600
it means that he was being chased by someone,

828
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,800
and that person must've intentionally hit him with the car.

829
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,080
Then what did the detective who made these smoke bombs say?

830
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,200
I obviously went to talk to him immediately after the accident,

831
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,120
but I found out that he also died from an accident.

832
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,400
Gosh, he's dead.

833
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,680
Do you happen to know that detective's name?

834
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,440
I don't remember it because it was too long ago.

835
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,320
I think he introduced himself as Detective Kang.

836
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,960
Detective Kang Soo Hyuk?

837
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,160
Yes, that's right.

838
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,040
Do you know him?

839
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,480
Yes, I do. I also worked in Moojin a long time ago.

840
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,240
By the way, you said that you had a bar in Moojin, right?

841
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,520
Whereabouts in Moojin was it?

842
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,960
You must know it if you used to work in Moojin.

843
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,680
It was under Mount Moojin by all those abandoned factories.

844
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,200
Then do you know Clara by any chance?

845
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,000
Clara? We were like sisters.

846
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,600
Then do you also know the girls who used to work at that bar?

847
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,480
Han Jin Sook and Kim Sun Young.

848
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,680
Sun Young?

849
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,280
Of course I know her. I practically raised her like my own daughter.

850
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,040
She's my friend's daughter,

851
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,840
but her parents died in a car accident,

852
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,800
so I took her in and raised her.

853
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,480
When I got arrested,

854
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,560
I sent Joon to his dad's place in Seoul,

855
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,680
but I didn't have anywhere to send Sun Young,

856
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,280
so I asked Clara to take care of her.

857
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,720
Clara said that she'd make her do chores and send her to school.

858
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,640
Where is Kim Sun Young now?

859
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,360
Actually,

860
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,720
I went to Clara's place because I wondered if Joon met Sun Young...

861
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,320
on the day of the accident.

862
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,160
But everything was closed in that area...

863
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,960
because of the police's prostitution crackdown.

864
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,480
I asked around, but no one knew where Clara and Sun Young were.

865
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,120
(Mother)

866
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,800
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave a message...

867
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,520
She's not even picking up.

868
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,800
This is so unlike her.

869
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,720
What if something happened to her?

870
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,280
Gosh.

871
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,440
Where's my charger?

872
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,880
What is this?

873
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,400
What are you doing?

874
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,920
Why are you touching my stuff without my permission?

875
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,280
Well, I was just...

876
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,320
I just thought that we could go home together.

877
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,080
Doctor, there's an emergency patient.

878
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,560
Go home before me.

879
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,080
Even Moo Gang's mother didn't believe me,

880
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,600
but I finally met someone who believes me after 20 years.

881
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,760
I recognized him right away.

882
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,200
He resembles his dad a lot.

883
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,400
I thought that Joon would look like him if he was alive.

884
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,960
I contacted you while going through reports about my brother's accident.

885
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,640
The accident that killed Joon wasn't a hit-and-run.

886
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,600
He was murdered.

887
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,480
You don't believe me, do you?

888
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,560
I do.

889
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,200
I believe you.

890
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,680
I do believe you.

891
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,360
Actually,

892
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,280
I think I have an idea of what happened that day.

893
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,360
Really?

894
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,280
What on earth happened?

895
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,000
I'll tell you everything later on.

896
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,640
I'm sorry. I should've come to see you sooner.

897
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,240
I know that it's very late,

898
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,640
but I'll reveal the truth about my brother's death...

899
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,680
at all costs.

900
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,600
He said that he had a good job in the States,

901
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,760
but he quit right away,

902
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,760
took the police exam, and joined the police force.

903
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,840
Moo Gang told me that there's something he had to do.

904
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,880
It must've been revealing the truth about his brother's death.

905
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,160
But Detective Han called me one day...

906
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,800
and said that he found out who killed his brother.

907
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,440
- He did? - Yes.

908
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,120
He said he'd call me again after securing firm evidence,

909
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,880
but I didn't hear back from him for quite a while,

910
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,240
so I called him about a month ago.

911
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,880
Then he said that he was on his way to find evidence and hung up.

912
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,880
What happened after that?

913
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,640
I couldn't get a hold of him after that.

914
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,360
I kept calling him, but he didn't pick up.

915
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,080
Then recently,

916
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,200
I heard about the accident from his mother.

917
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,880
She said that he lost his memory.

918
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,360
He found evidence?

919
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,360
Han Moo Gang did?

920
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,080
When did you call him?

921
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,080
Just a moment, please.

922
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,080
Oh, it was October 14th.

923
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,600
October 14th?

924
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,040
October 14th...

925
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,280
That was the day you were in the hostage situation.

926
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,880
May I look at your phone for a second?

927
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,200
4:27pm?

928
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,920
Where's Doctor Min? I think it's cardiac arrest.

929
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,920
- Get the defibrillator... - Doctor Min, it's cardiac arrest.

930
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,000
Move.

931
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,560
- Really? - Yes.

932
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,680
The speeding ticket was issued on the day of the accident.

933
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,480
What? 120 dollars?

934
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,240
"October 14th. Gangjeong Intersection."

935
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,160
"140km per hour"?

936
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,920
Gangjeong Intersection is...

937
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,560
in the opposite direction from the shopping mall.

938
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,480
He said he went to the shopping mall,

939
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,600
but he got a speeding ticket at a totally random place.

940
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
I was like, "What is this about?"

941
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,960
The ticket was issued at 4:20pm,

942
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,440
so at 4:27pm,

943
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,120
Moo Gang must've been driving at 140km per hour...

944
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,520
while going somewhere.

945
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:48,960
He went for evidence and appeared 2 hours later at 9pm.

946
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,720
That's enough time...

947
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,440
to find and place the piece of evidence somewhere.

948
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,200
I found it.

949
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,840
"LMB Investment"?

950
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,040
Hold on. Where did I see that company's name?

951
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,440
Royeol Construction gave 65 million dollars to the company 10 years ago.

952
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,480
They bought the land of Moojin Time Mart.

953
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,240
In 1997, Oh Man Ho invested...

954
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,240
30 million dollars in this company.

955
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,200
With that money, the company bought the land.

956
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,360
10 years later, Oh Man Ho bought the same land...

957
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,680
by giving 65 million dollars.

958
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,680
That means he put 35 million dollars in his own pocket.

959
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,240
That's right.

960
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,880
What's this?

961
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,320
It's a paper company.

962
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,760
I knew it. The books were too clean.

963
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,800
They were using the difference for lobby funds through the company.

964
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,480
What's the piece of evidence?

965
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,240
If he found it, he must have kept it somewhere safe.

966
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,560
What's this?

967
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,840
(Royeol Oh Man Ho)

968
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,920
"Royeol Oh Man Ho"?

969
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,480
Why did Moo Gang do this?

970
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,040
"1997", "Moojin, "Woo Byung Sik".

971
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,320
Did Woo Byung Sik work at Moojin Chunsu Insurance in 1997?

972
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,240
Did Oh Man Ho...

973
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,440
"A Fire at Moojin in 1997".

974
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,720
Wait, where did I see this?

975
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,280
What's this?

976
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,240
"A Fire at Moojin in 1997".

977
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,040
He struggles with a case from two days ago.

978
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,160
Why is he looking at a case from 20 years ago?

979
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,360
That's right.

980
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,920
Han Moo Gang...

981
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,160
had the investigation file for this case.

982
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,080
No way.

983
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,720
The smell will get stuck in the car.

984
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,960
I'm sorry.

985
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,480
I was delivering fish when the detective called me.

986
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,720
I came in such a hurry.

987
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:53,200
Why did Crazy Dog ask me to drop her off? It's a nuisance.

988
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,040
What happened to you...

989
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,280
wasn't an accident.

990
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,720
He will...

991
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,440
try to kill you again.

992
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,120
So...

993
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,560
That means Han Moo Gang was killed while investigating Joon's case.

994
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,880
Then did the same person kill Joon and Han Moo Gang?

995
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,720
That's none of my business.

996
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,040
Thank you, Detective Han.

997
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,480
Goodbye then.

998
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,320
Ma'am, why are you so late?

999
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,520
- What are you doing? - Darn it.

1000
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,960
- You jerks. - Hey!

1001
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,320
- Seriously. - Get off me.

1002
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,280
- Darn it. - Hey, break everything!

1003
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,320
What?

1004
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,480
Where did he go after telling me to drop off that smelly woman?

1005
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,760
Didn't you see him?

1006
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,920
He ran out after reading a document that he found in your drawer.

1007
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,120
A document?

1008
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,680
Didn't Ha Ram's father investigate this case?

1009
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,560
Was it in Han Moo Gang's drawer?

1010
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,400
In the lady's belly,

1011
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,800
a piece of yellow paper is burning.

1012
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,800
A piece of yellow paper is burning?

1013
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,320
What we found at the fire incident at Moojin...

1014
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,160
was also found at the crime scene of Lee Mi So?

1015
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,560
- Get off me! - You brats!

1016
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,120
Come here!

1017
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,560
You punks, stop right there!

1018
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,600
(Identity search)

1019
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,920
Are these Chinese bills?

1020
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,200
The test result shows that it's a bill.

1021
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,200
It's yellow, so I'm sure it's Chinese bills.

1022
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,360
Why would he burn money after murdering?

1023
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,760
In China,

1024
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,600
people burn money when someone dies.

1025
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,320
It's a custom to free the spirit.

1026
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,520
Maybe it was an act of exorcism after the murder.

1027
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,840
Did he come from China?

1028
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,920
I think it's him indeed.

1029
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,120
It's a video of the night before Sang Min's warrant was overturned.

1030
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,000
Let it be a prosecutor. It can be Nam Joong Pyo.

1031
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,000
Just dare to get into that car.

1032
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,760
What?

1033
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,240
What's this?

1034
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,720
Why is Mi So with him?

1035
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,480
What's the matter?

1036
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,160
Look. It's him, isn't it?

1037
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,080
Isn't this man who killed the doctor and ran away?

1038
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,160
Give it to me.

1039
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,160
Look.

1040
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,720
Yes, it's him.

1041
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,880
Really?

1042
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,560
Did this insane murderer kill Ha Ram's father?

1043
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,120
And he's still alive?

1044
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,560
Who's still alive?

1045
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,560
The man who killed your father. Take a look.

1046
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,680
I definitely heard...

1047
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,720
that he was dead.

1048
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,200
Why is there a scar on his face?

1049
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,040
Where did you get this photo?

1050
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,840
It was taken by Oh Man Ho's black box.

1051
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,360
It was taken from behind his car when he was with Mi So.

1052
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,960
Lee Mi So?

1053
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,040
Is the murderer of Lee Mi So...

1054
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,400
who killed my father?

1055
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,080
Did I let the man who killed my father get away twice?

1056
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,080
Ha Ram... Ha Ram.

1057
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,279
No way. I heard that he was dead.

1058
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,560
He's definitely dead. It can't be.

1059
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,319
His sister-in-law said that he was dead.

1060
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,279
Is your brother-in-law dead?

1061
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,439
This isn't your brother-in-law, right?

1062
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,960
Please leave.

1063
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,560
Answer me. Tell me that your brother-in-law is dead.

1064
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,279
Tell me that it isn't him.

1065
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,800
Tell me that the serial killer is someone else.

1066
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,800
Answer me!

1067
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,399
I don't know anything about him.

1068
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:07,399
So don't ever come back.

1069
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,439
Your brother-in-law will kill you.

1070
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:11,680
Run away now.

1071
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,560
You're insane.

1072
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,040
Wait.

1073
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,560
Ha Ram already found out.

1074
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,160
Wait.

1075
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,160
Did she go to his sister-in-law's house already?

1076
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,280
I guess she hasn't come yet.

1077
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,040
Excuse me.

1078
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,480
Is this the man who killed the director?

1079
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,760
I think so,

1080
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,840
but another detective already came to ask.

1081
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,680
What? Who?

1082
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,920
- When are the forensics guys coming? - They're coming right now.

1083
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,080
In that case...

1084
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,400
Don't step on it. Move away from it.

1085
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,360
- How dare you? - Leave it alone.

1086
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,520
Goodness.

1087
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,400
Let's talk. Come here.

1088
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,280
What happened? Do you remember anything?

1089
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,720
No.

1090
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,040
Then how did you know...

1091
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,560
that the man from the fire incident at Moojin was the murderer?

1092
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,560
Gwang Gyun! Gwang Gyun.

1093
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,200
- What is it? - Look.

1094
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,560
What is it? Stop trembling.

1095
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,800
You hold it.

1096
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,360
Something was caught on camera. I think it's the culprit.

1097
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,080
Look, someone is following him.

1098
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,960
What? Did she come here already?

1099
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,960
Ha Ram.

1100
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,200
Ha Ram!

1101
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,600
Ha Ram.

1102
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,200
Ha Ram!

1103
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,000
Ha Ram.

1104
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,680
Ha Ram!

1105
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,520
No.

1106
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,440
She isn't dead.

1107
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,680
She can't die unless we open the capsule.

1108
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,920
Why is this here?

1109
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,840
Who leaves this around so carelessly?

1110
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,400
Gosh, it belongs to 444.

1111
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,120
I thought that he ran away.

1112
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,720
This will serve him right.

1113
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,600
Ha Ram!

1114
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,640
Ha Ram.

1115
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,720
Ha Ram!

1116
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,880
Ha Ram.

1117
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,400
- Hello? - I have the blood test results.

1118
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,160
It's 99.98 percent certain that it's Ha Ram's blood.

1119
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,280
What?

1120
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,920
If she lost two liters of blood,

1121
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,560
it's impossible for her to survive.

1122
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,920
She... She died?

1123
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,360
(Black)
