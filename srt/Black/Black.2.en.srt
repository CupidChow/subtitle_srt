00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,800
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm so happy.

3
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,560
- Honey. - Yes?

4
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,240
- I love you. - I love you too.

5
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,640
Look at the sea!

6
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,600
My, this is so nice.

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,360
It's dangerous.

8
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,040
Honey.

9
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,880
No, honey.

10
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,120
No.

11
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
No, honey. No, don't die!

12
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,960
Honey.

13
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
No, no.

14
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,240
Don't ever forget.

15
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,000
You must not make eye contact with any human who's in love.

16
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,800
If you do,

17
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,680
a horrible tragedy will happen to you.

18
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,880
(Black)

19
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Ma'am.

20
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,160
What do you mean he died? Where's Moo Gang?

21
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,520
Soo Wan.

22
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,040
It's not true, right?

23
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,320
This can't be happening. I've been misinformed, right?

24
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
Mother.

25
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
No, no. That can't be.

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,840
How...

27
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,600
Do you know what I went through to make sure he could live?

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,000
Where's Moo Gang? Where is my son?

29
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,120
- Where is he? - Ma'am.

30
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,240
Wait.

31
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,000
There... He's there...

32
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,800
He's alive.

33
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,480
He's totally fine and alive.

34
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,079
He's over there.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,160
What? You mean Moo Gang... Moo Gang is alive?

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Yes.

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,320
What are you talking about? I confirmed him dead.

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,680
I just ran into him in the hallway.

39
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,880
Moo Gang!

40
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
Moo Gang.

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,240
Where is he?

42
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,240
He was right there.

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,079
I should die.

44
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,519
I should die.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,720
I should die...

46
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,600
According to the most recent update, Sergeant Han Moo Gang who was...

47
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
said to have been shot to death in the hostage situation...

48
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,080
that took place at N shopping mall in Seoul...

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
is actually alive.

50
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,840
Sergeant Han is being treated at Royeol Hospital at the moment,

51
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,280
and the injury will not...

52
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,680
- affect his life. - What? How...

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,840
The Human Rights Commission has pointed out...

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,040
that there might have been excessive use of force...

55
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
Help. Help me.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
He's alive?

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
Then why should I die? I shouldn't have to die.

58
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm going to live. I want to live.

59
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
I want to live.

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,760
Help. Help me, Dad.

61
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,360
Is that possible? How can someone who's been shot be totally fine?

62
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,080
- Ma'am. - Mother.

63
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,040
What is this dog doing? It's disgusting.

64
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,520
- What do you want? - You have...

65
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,480
such a nasty temper.

66
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,080
- What is going on? You startled me. - Sorry, calm down.

67
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,880
Who are you? What do you want?

68
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,600
Let me introduce myself.

69
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
My name is Oh Man Soo.

70
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,920
My father named me Man Soo because he wanted me to live a long life.

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,240
And this is my brother, Oh Sip Gyeon.

72
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,880
He saved your life.

73
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,200
He saved my life?

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,360
Hey, are you okay?

75
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,520
Did you really come for me?

76
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,360
You little...

77
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,800
- Are you a thief? - What?

78
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,600
- That's why my house is a mess. - No.

79
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
You worthless scumbag.

80
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,280
Why would you break into someone's house?

81
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,880
- Get out. - Wait.

82
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,440
- Go. - Let me explain.

83
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,159
The vet says my dog will die soon.

84
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,880
That's why I came to ask you if he'll really die or not.

85
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,000
What? How should I know that?

86
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,720
Let go of me first.

87
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,640
I saw you at the police station.

88
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,360
You were suspected as a terrorist.

89
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,640
You said you can see the shadow of death or something.

90
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,000
I got your phone number secretly at the police station.

91
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
Excuse me.

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,760
Ms. Shaman?

93
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,080
Let's go, Sip Gyeon.

94
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,520
Hey.

95
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,920
Dad.

96
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
You're saying...

97
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,560
that dog saved my life?

98
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,280
What do you think? Can you see it?

99
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,240
Is Sip Gyeon going to die?

100
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,840
Do you really think I can see death?

101
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,480
Of course.

102
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,000
You knew that plane would crash. How can I not believe it?

103
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,520
You recently became a shaman, right?

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
You totally sounded like it.

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,720
Has it been 3 months? Just 1 month?

106
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,840
My goodness.

107
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,480
You must be really good.

108
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,480
Hurry.

109
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you...

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
have a car?

111
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,159
What?

112
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,000
(Private Lee arrested at the scene)

113
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,720
(Approval rate for Nam Joong Pyo has plunged.)

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,040
What?

115
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,480
Stop. Stop the car.

116
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,120
Ma'am.

117
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
You should pay for my service.

118
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,480
What will happen to Sip Gyeon?

119
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,200
He will live until he gets old and eats his own poop.

120
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,960
Wait. Hey! My gosh.

121
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,840
He's old and smelly already.

122
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Joon! You're alive.

123
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
Who are you? Get lost.

124
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,520
Joon, I'm sorry.

125
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,520
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it.

126
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,800
I said get lost!

127
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,360
Joon. Joon!

128
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,320
Joon.

129
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,200
Joon, wake up.

130
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,560
Help. Can anyone help me?

131
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,560
Joon. Are you okay?

132
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
Help. Help!

133
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,600
Gosh, thank you.

134
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,360
I heard you brought him to the hospital.

135
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,160
How is Detective Han?

136
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,840
He just fell asleep.

137
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,680
By the way, how do you know him?

138
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,760
What about you? Who are you?

139
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,760
I'm his mother.

140
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,280
His mother?

141
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,640
Oh, it's his mom in Seoul.

142
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,760
Excuse me?

143
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,280
May I ask how you know Moo Gang?

144
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,680
He and I met... Well...

145
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,320
I helped Detective Han with his investigation before.

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,920
I see.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,800
It's late. You should go home.

148
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,280
We'll call you if he wakes up.

149
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,880
Okay.

150
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,160
You should go home and get some rest too, Mother.

151
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,720
You must've been startled.

152
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,560
Okay, I will.

153
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
The head of neurosurgery wants to see you.

154
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,160
She called his mom "mother".

155
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
Is she his girlfriend?

156
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,200
If it had gone only 0.5mm deeper,

157
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,840
he would've died. He was lucky.

158
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,640
He was also lucky that the bullet got stuck...

159
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,480
instead of penetrating his head.

160
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,080
- He needs a surgery... - The bullet is near his medulla.

161
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,360
I might nick his cerebral artery if I operate.

162
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,200
It's better to leave it in for now. Let's keep monitoring him.

163
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,000
Wait, but...

164
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,680
Well, I haven't handled a case like this before,

165
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,760
but there's a case where a man lived until 80 with a bullet in his head.

166
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,480
Don't worry too much.

167
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,920
Does he have any other problems?

168
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,280
His blood pressure and pulse are all normal.

169
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,080
His gunshot wound is healing quickly too.

170
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,840
There's no more bleeding,

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,800
and he doesn't have any infections.

172
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,560
What happened?

173
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,960
I heard your son was in an accident.

174
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,600
Fortunately, it won't affect his life.

175
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,600
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.

176
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,720
Doctor Yoon.

177
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,880
I heard you called his time of death.

178
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,520
What happened?

179
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,920
That's... He was clearly...

180
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,760
I thought Moo Gang was dead.

181
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,200
If he really had been dead,

182
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
I would've followed him.

183
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
Please don't say that.

184
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,480
Moo Gang is alive.

185
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,040
I should give this back to him before I go.

186
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
All right.

187
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,160
Understood.

188
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,480
I'll inject it.

189
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm sorry. Here...

190
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,360
I can't believe how rude he was.

191
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,520
He should apologize to me too.

192
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,240
What a strange guy.

193
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,600
(Royeol Hospital)

194
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,120
You're awake.

195
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,120
Do you have any pain? What about headaches?

196
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,720
I'm sorry, Moo Gang. It's...

197
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,920
It's all my fault. Please forgive me.

198
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,040
Listen.

199
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,640
I didn't approach you on purpose.

200
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,080
I just...

201
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,400
Who are you?

202
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,560
What?

203
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,120
Why does your appearance...

204
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,240
make a change of feeling here?

205
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,760
Why is this happening?

206
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,080
Why?

207
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,840
Why do I feel a flutter here?

208
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,320
What...

209
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,600
They say your heart recognizes the one you're meant to be with.

210
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,640
Does this mean I'll die?

211
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,160
What is going on?

212
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,040
Is this broken?

213
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,840
You told me...

214
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,280
that your heart will recognize...

215
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,520
the one you're meant to be with before anything else does.

216
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,920
What are you talking about? I have no idea what that means.

217
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,760
Get lost.

218
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
I said, get lost.

219
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,160
Yes.

220
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,120
Looking at him up close, I can see that he looks just like he used to.

221
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,720
I'm an idiot. Why couldn't I recognize him sooner?

222
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,000
Joon.

223
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,880
You grew up into a wonderful man.

224
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,040
You weren't sleeping?

225
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,680
Ha Ram.

226
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,840
- Do you like me that much? - What?

227
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Yes.

228
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
What do you like about me?

229
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,200
Everything. From your eyes, nose, and lips to how nice you are...

230
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,760
and how well you can fight, I like everything about you.

231
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,120
I'll become your bride when I grow up.

232
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
What?

233
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,400
My bride?

234
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,840
That's right. So don't like that girl.

235
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,120
That girl?

236
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,760
Don't. I hate it.

237
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,800
I don't want you to like that girl.

238
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,040
I'll be 100 times prettier than her when I grow up.

239
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,400
You don't even know her face.

240
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,960
Right, so like me back instead of her, okay?

241
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,880
I don't even wear my glasses these days...

242
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,480
because you said my eyes are pretty!

243
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Okay, all right. I won't like her. Stop crying now.

244
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,240
All right. I'll marry you, Ha Ram.

245
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,520
Okay.

246
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,080
Promise me.

247
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,720
We even made a pinky promise.

248
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,840
He grew up so well.

249
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,800
The bracelet.

250
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,800
My gosh!

251
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,400
Who are you?

252
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Joon, I'm...

253
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,880
What? You're that girl from...

254
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm... I'm Ha Ram, Kang Ha Ram.

255
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,320
Don't you remember me? I'm Kang Ha Ram.

256
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,040
Joon, do you remember the outcast at Moojin Elementary School?

257
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,680
The shaman kid with sunglasses.

258
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,800
- I'm... - Get lost.

259
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,920
Joon, you don't remember me? That's impossible.

260
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,200
I told you to get lost!

261
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,440
I saw you letting that woman rub your chest.

262
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,720
Do you get disgusted even when I just touch you?

263
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,520
Then why have you been wearing this bracelet I gave you all this time?

264
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,240
You confused me, jerk.

265
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,040
You're such a jerk!

266
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,960
Who is that girl?

267
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,360
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

268
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,480
He doesn't remember me?

269
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,360
That is crazy!

270
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,400
Gosh, where did I put it?

271
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,240
The jacket.

272
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,240
Yes.

273
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,280
Hey, you!

274
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,760
Gosh, that startled me.

275
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,560
That's...

276
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,240
Well, what are you doing now?

277
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Move.

278
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,160
Where are you going? I have to talk to you about something!

279
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,560
Where are you going?

280
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,680
Leave me alone. I don't know.

281
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,560
You're a patient. You can't just leave like that.

282
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,560
Joon, Joon.

283
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,320
I'm asking you where you're going.

284
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,320
Joon!

285
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,800
Gosh, where are you going right now?

286
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,520
Joon.

287
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,720
Joon! My gosh.

288
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,600
What do you want? Why do you keep following me around?

289
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,640
What is your problem?

290
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,160
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

291
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,760
If you're embarrassed of me, just tell me so.

292
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,800
You recognized me...

293
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,560
when you saw me at the burger place, didn't you?

294
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
You must've come to see me knowing who I am.

295
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,760
I knew it.

296
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,760
The spiel about how my ability is a blessing, not a curse.

297
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,840
That's exactly what you said to me right before you moved to Seoul.

298
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,480
Right, the pieces of the puzzle are finally falling into place.

299
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,840
I mean, I'm probably the only person in the world with such ability.

300
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,920
There's no way you can't recognize me.

301
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,400
Joon, why did you pretend you didn't know me?

302
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,160
Why? Because I'm in this mess when we met again after 20 years?

303
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,520
Are you disappointed and embarrassed of me?

304
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,960
Was it because you're embarrassed of me?

305
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,320
How... My gosh!

306
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,880
What are you doing?

307
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,480
What are you doing now?

308
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Joon, Joon!

309
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,520
Go. Hurry up!

310
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,240
What are you waiting for? Let's go! That girl is following me. Hurry up!

311
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,400
I can't go anywhere until you pay your fare.

312
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,800
- What? - Get off if you have no money.

313
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,480
It's for two people.

314
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,440
We can't find him anywhere.

315
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,440
He's in no condition to leave the hospital.

316
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,640
You guys didn't even notice him leaving. What were you all doing?

317
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,960
We're sorry.

318
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,640
Thank you for calling Royeol Hospital.

319
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,640
Pardon me?

320
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,040
Doctor, your son is...

321
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,960
Moo Gang.

322
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,360
Hello, I'm not Han Moo Gang.

323
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,640
I'm the girl who brought him to the hospital yesterday.

324
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,920
Yes, he's on a bus now. It looks like he's going somewhere.

325
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,200
Where are you going?

326
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,840
I keep telling him to go back to the hospital, but he's not listening.

327
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,760
Yes, I'll call you again as soon as we get off the bus. Okay.

328
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,520
Look. Stop trying to look cool, and hold on to the strap.

329
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,320
You might tumble.

330
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,800
No.

331
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,760
How can I lose this woman?

332
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,760
She's so annoying.

333
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,920
Oh, gosh.

334
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,840
What did I tell you? I told you to hold on to the strap.

335
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,520
Why are you so stubborn when your legs are so weak?

336
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,280
Do I look like such a weak person?

337
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,960
I don't rely on these things!

338
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,960
- Oh, my. - Hey.

339
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,640
You have time for bluffing,

340
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,680
and you don't have time for an apology?

341
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,120
What's your problem?

342
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,520
You just stepped on my foot.

343
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,680
You should apologize.

344
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,160
Does it hurt?

345
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Of course.

346
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,920
If I apologize, would it hurt less?

347
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,040
What?

348
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,920
- Would it hurt less? - What did you say?

349
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,600
I can't believe this jerk!

350
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,240
I'm sorry, sir. This man injured his head in an accident.

351
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,080
He's not in a good state.

352
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,480
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

353
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,680
He's supposed to be in a hospital. I'm sorry.

354
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,520
Come this way. Gosh, come on now.

355
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,280
I told you to hold on to it.

356
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,440
Hold on to this for goodness' sake.

357
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,520
When will these people get up?

358
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,680
Hey.

359
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,920
Hey, wake up. I said wake up.

360
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,720
Do you think this is your own room?

361
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,960
What are you doing?

362
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,960
Wake up. Wake up!

363
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,120
Who are you?

364
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,880
I've been watching. You two have been sitting down the longest.

365
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,280
Get up.

366
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,600
Get off already!

367
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,040
What's wrong with you?

368
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,000
Look. I'm getting off now. Just sit here,

369
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,880
and stop making noises.

370
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,600
I don't take orders from humans.

371
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,800
Oh, goodness.

372
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

373
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,640
Oh, my back. Gosh, my legs.

374
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,440
Goodness, this is killing me.

375
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,440
Don't worry. You won't die soon.

376
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,920
Gosh.

377
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,560
Old people should just die.

378
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,760
My gosh.

379
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,040
Why are you hitting me, old lady?

380
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,960
Goodness. Young people these days are...

381
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
just so rude.

382
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,720
What a rude person.

383
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,240
How uncivil.

384
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,200
You brat. Don't you have parents?

385
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,720
No. What are you going to do?

386
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,160
Gosh, he startled me.

387
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm sorry...

388
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,480
Oh, gosh.

389
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,120
I'm sorry.

390
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

391
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,280
Joon.

392
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Ma'am. Where did he...

393
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,600
Joon!

394
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,920
Oh, goodness!

395
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,840
Gosh, it got on my hand.

396
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,960
What? Moo Gang.

397
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,200
Why are you coming out of there?

398
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,040
Hey. Moo Gang.

399
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,160
Are... Are you okay?

400
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,680
Hey, I thought you died...

401
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
(Oh So Tae)

402
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,880
- Get it off of me. - What?

403
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,640
How dirty.

404
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

405
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,000
I thought you were staying in a hospital.

406
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,480
When did you get here?

407
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,320
You're even wearing a hospital gown.

408
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,120
Are you a detective?

409
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,000
What?

410
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,040
Have you gone crazy?

411
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,520
I'm your senior. How dare you?

412
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
What?

413
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,840
What is it? What?

414
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,640
Anyhow, you're a detective.

415
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,880
Follow me.

416
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,040
How dare you tell me to...

417
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,160
Wait. Hold on a second.

418
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,120
Gosh, it hurts.

419
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,600
Here it is.

420
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,480
Why do you need this address?

421
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,640
Write it down.

422
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,880
Gosh, you rude brat.

423
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,080
Hey, do you think I'm a pushover?

424
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,800
I said write it down.

425
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,440
My gosh.

426
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,200
Fine.

427
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,600
I'm only doing it because you injured your head...

428
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,040
and you're clearly not okay yet.

429
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
There won't be a next time.

430
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,280
Hey!

431
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,720
You think I'm a pushover, don't you?

432
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,440
He's not in his right mind. What should I do about him?

433
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,200
Hold on. What was his mom's phone number?

434
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,560
Let's see.

435
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,720
Hello? This is Oh So Tae of...

436
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,480
What? A murder?

437
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,400
I'm sure he will show up here.

438
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,720
Are you okay?

439
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,040
You must be cold.

440
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,040
Mind your own business. I'm busy.

441
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,720
Why are you so busy?

442
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,960
I'm tailing someone. Stop talking to me.

443
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,360
Whom? Whom are you tailing?

444
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,880
You.

445
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
What is this?

446
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,000
Get yourself some food with this.

447
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,360
You remind me of my late son.

448
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,080
Ma'am.

449
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,920
Today is the appointed day. Did you get the money ready?

450
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,720
I don't get many customers these days.

451
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,800
What? What are you doing?

452
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,600
Where are we going?

453
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,160
He finally showed up.

454
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,400
What are you doing?

455
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,320
That's right. He would need money to stay in hiding.

456
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,400
Who are you?

457
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,640
What do you think?

458
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,480
You punk.

459
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,880
I guess you know how to fight a little.

460
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,960
Gosh, all right.

461
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,040
I won't go easy on you this time.

462
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,760
I won't go easy on you now, you punk.

463
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,000
Why... Why are you doing this to me?

464
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,159
What? I got the wrong person.

465
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,400
Hey! Who are you?

466
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,120
Who are you?

467
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,800
Are you an underling of Gal Chi?

468
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,320
Gosh, he doesn't know a thing about business ethics.

469
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,880
Let me say this again.

470
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,239
This area belongs to us.

471
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,239
Do you hear me?

472
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,000
Move, Baldy.

473
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,199
"Baldy"?

474
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,639
Are you begging us to kill you?

475
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,560
Boss, we need to teach him a lesson.

476
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,960
Wait.

477
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,400
Isn't he the detective from the other day?

478
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
What? Is he a detective?

479
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,800
Don't you remember him? At the barbecue restaurant.

480
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,960
Oh, that's right. You're that loser.

481
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,360
That was you.

482
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,520
It looks like he's sick.

483
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,160
Come on. Where do you think you're going?

484
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,480
You beat my guy into a pulp.

485
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,200
You should either apologize or compensate for what you did.

486
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,080
Don't you agree?

487
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,080
He's the one who confused me by taking the money.

488
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,680
Get lost.

489
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,480
I don't think this detective gets my message.

490
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,160
Go get him!

491
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,040
- My gosh. - Look at him.

492
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,000
- How incredible. - My goodness.

493
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,240
- He's a great fighter. - How impressive.

494
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,560
- Look at him. - My gosh.

495
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,520
My goodness.

496
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,400
I'm so good.

497
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,840
His sister apparently goes to this school.

498
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,360
My goodness gracious.

499
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,360
Sir, it fits you perfectly.

500
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,640
You look like a model.

501
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,120
How much is it?

502
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,360
Let me see.

503
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,480
With a 10 percent discount, it costs 2,370 dollars.

504
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,120
Why?

505
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,280
Do I need to give you more?

506
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,640
Sir.

507
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,320
What?

508
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,800
Where did he go? What happened?

509
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,920
- I completely failed this year. - Me too.

510
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,320
- Whatever. - My gosh.

511
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,440
What was that sound?

512
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,360
What's a guy doing here?

513
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,080
My gosh, that startled me.

514
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,520
What's their problem?

515
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,360
You look completely normal.

516
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,920
I can't believe you acted like a pervert in the girls' bathroom.

517
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,400
"Pervert"?

518
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,880
What did that mean again?

519
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,400
I can't remember what it meant.

520
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,160
Hey, hey! Close them.

521
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,600
I said, close them.

522
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,920
Close what? I'm not a door.

523
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,120
My gosh, what a lunatic.

524
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,640
I can't even be bothered to swear at you.

525
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,680
What's your name?

526
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,280
Tell me your name!

527
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,480
Han...

528
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,040
What was it?

529
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,240
Oh, right. Detective Han.

530
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,560
"Detective Han"?

531
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,160
Is your name Detective? That's too grand of a name for you.

532
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,520
What's your social security number?

533
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,640
"Social security number"?

534
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,640
Well, I'm not a member of this society.

535
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,800
Are you trying to pick a fight with me or what?

536
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,040
Where are you going? Hey!

537
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,480
What? What are you doing?

538
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,040
What's your problem?

539
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,320
You punk.

540
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,480
Do you know this guy?

541
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,040
- You punk. - What's your problem?

542
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,720
- My gosh. - Put it down.

543
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,840
- Hey! - Stop it.

544
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,120
Detective Han?

545
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,920
I can't understand it either.

546
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,240
But he got caught red-handed.

547
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,680
Okay, sir.

548
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,600
Detective Han. Detective Han!

549
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,800
Here, you need to take this call. It's Crazy...

550
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,560
It's Detective Na.

551
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,040
I don't know who he is.

552
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,760
He's your partner, Detective Na. Hurry up, and take the phone.

553
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,320
What do you want?

554
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,920
What do you want?

555
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,760
You're holding it upside down.

556
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,720
It's the other way around.

557
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,840
Han Moo Gang!

558
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,080
What? What?

559
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,240
How dare you talk to me that way? Have you gone mad? Hey!

560
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,520
Get over here right now.

561
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,360
- I'm busy. - You're not busy.

562
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,760
If you don't get over here right now,

563
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,320
you'll never be able to work as a detective again.

564
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,920
- This punk. - Who is it?

565
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,120
It's Moo Gang.

566
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,320
How dare he talk to me like I'm his friend?

567
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,920
This psycho completely slashed her to death.

568
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,640
Why did he stab her so many times? Her intestines are falling out.

569
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,480
I'm sure that psychopath didn't even think of her as a human being.

570
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,440
Where's the witness?

571
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,320
Ms. Kim Mi Yeon?

572
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,520
I heard you saw the patient stab her and run away.

573
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,800
Yes.

574
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,560
It was time for her to do her rounds.

575
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,960
But she wasn't coming out, so I went inside her office.

576
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,480
Are you saying he just ran away without harming you...

577
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,960
even when he knew that you had witnessed the murder?

578
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,800
My goodness. Hello, Detective So.

579
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,160
I don't know you. Hello, Detective Kang.

580
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,200
Good work. We'll take it from here.

581
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,960
You guys can go now. You must be busy.

582
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,800
And tell the chief that I respect him a lot.

583
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,480
Are you sure you can do this?

584
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,960
Of course. You can go now.

585
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,320
He said he's going to trust you with this.

586
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,440
Okay, trust me. You can go now. Go on.

587
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,960
Hey.

588
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,360
What happened? Did you find anything out?

589
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,200
We're looking for him with the help of a nearby precinct station.

590
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,720
It's a rural area, so he couldn't have gone too far away.

591
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,360
- I'm sure we'll catch him soon. - Okay.

592
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,880
What about his identity?

593
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,680
His real name isn't Kang Bong Gyu, and all the documents are fake.

594
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,600
We're checking for both his fingerprints and DNA...

595
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,080
from the hospital room he was staying at.

596
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,400
So we'll be able to find out his identity soon.

597
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,520
You know this is a great opportunity for us, right?

598
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,320
Let's do this well and recover our reputation.

599
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,440
Yes, sir.

600
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,680
- My gosh. - Hey, Chief Bong.

601
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,160
- Hey. - What do you have?

602
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,800
- Here. - What is it?

603
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,240
This was stuck in between his toilet seat.

604
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,880
I think he was trying to burn it and flush it down the toilet.

605
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,840
What? Who is he?

606
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,960
Do you think it's his son?

607
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,720
I don't know.

608
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,720
Hey, So Tae. Go to the office, and check if there are any...

609
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,160
fingerprints or DNA on this photo. And look into who this could be.

610
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,280
Okay.

611
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,200
My gosh.

612
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,720
I have to go to the bathroom again. I'll leave after I take a leak.

613
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,120
Just wear diapers, you punk! How can he call himself a detective?

614
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,520
Can this guy...

615
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,440
stop Moo Gang from working as a detective?

616
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Have you lost your mind?

617
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,240
Don't you know how hot-tempered he is?

618
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,440
You'll not only lose your job.

619
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,840
If Crazy Dog decides to hunt you down,

620
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,680
you'll end up losing your life.

621
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,920
Really?

622
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,560
I can't lose my job. It'll ruin my plan.

623
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,680
- Where's this punk? - "Punk"?

624
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,640
He's at Hope Mental Hospital in Bookyangju.

625
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,280
"Hope Mental Hospital"?

626
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,920
Gosh, I got it on my hands again.

627
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,320
Hey, why are you coming out of there again?

628
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,120
And why are you dressed like that?

629
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,920
You're not even wearing underwear. What a pervert.

630
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,880
(Evidence)

631
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Hey, take your time coming out of here.

632
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,120
It's not easy to aim.

633
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,240
Hey.

634
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,800
I know. Calm down.

635
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,080
I'm not a pervert. I'm a detective.

636
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,240
I'm Detective Han.

637
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,240
But why aren't you wearing any pants?

638
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,920
Don't mind me.

639
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,040
Anyway, do you know where...

640
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,440
Crazy Dog is?

641
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,240
- "Crazy Dog"? - Yes.

642
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,840
Oh, are you talking about that detective?

643
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,920
Everyone's at the director's office.

644
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,880
Sir, wait.

645
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,840
I forgot to tell anyone this earlier because things were so hectic.

646
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,720
But about that patient who was in room number seven...

647
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,120
He had a hook-shaped scar on his face.

648
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,040
He also had a burn scar on his hand.

649
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,600
Emergency! Emergency!

650
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,880
Emergency! Emergency!

651
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,000
Moo Gang's here! Hide the corpse!

652
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,360
Hurry up! Cover it up!

653
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,520
He can't be here already.

654
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,560
- Hurry up. - Cover it up.

655
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,320
- Do that later. - Be quiet.

656
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,680
Detective Han!

657
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,840
Stop shaking your hands.

658
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,280
Hold it properly.

659
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,240
Crazy Dog.

660
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,080
Crazy Dog!

661
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,600
My gosh, what's this punk's problem today?

662
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,760
What do you want?

663
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,520
Was it you?

664
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,520
What?

665
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,640
Why did you ask me to come? You told me to come right away.

666
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,640
How dare you talk to me as if I'm your friend?

667
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,480
Have you gone mad?

668
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,640
Did you want me here so you could ask me that question?

669
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,960
Moo Gang!

670
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,000
Anyway, I got here.

671
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,640
So you better not fire me.

672
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,360
- What? - I need this job for a while.

673
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,400
So don't fire me until I'm done getting what I need.

674
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,920
Hey, Moo Gang. Are you okay?

675
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,240
Do you feel okay even after looking at this...

676
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,680
corpse that's covered in blood?

677
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,200
Look at the corpse.

678
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,920
It's okay.

679
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,480
He must've been full of resentment.

680
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,760
How foolish of him. Humans don't get to live for that long anyway.

681
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,200
What a load of nonsense.

682
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,360
He was just a psycho who stabbed her anywhere he could.

683
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,160
You're wrong, you stupid fool.

684
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,760
What did you just say?

685
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,520
He didn't just stab her anywhere.

686
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,320
He purposely stabbed her...

687
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,080
only in places that cause the most severe pain.

688
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,040
He stabbed and twisted the knife.

689
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,240
He watched her die a very painful death.

690
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,520
Detective Han must be really ill.

691
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,720
Wait a second.

692
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,560
My gosh, give me that.

693
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,160
Look at this.

694
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,240
He stabbed her and twisted the knife in a 90 degree angle.

695
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,240
She must've died very painfully.

696
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,080
People who murder people like this are normally...

697
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,920
gang members or a hired assassin.

698
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,520
That makes sense.

699
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,680
He has a point.

700
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,960
Of course, we'll only be sure after we do an autopsy on her.

701
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh, is that so?

702
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,440
How do you know about all this, Detective Han?

703
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,560
I know just by looking at it.

704
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,240
I've been doing this for years now.

705
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,400
He must've gone completely insane...

706
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,320
after having been shot in the head.

707
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,960
Who ordered food?

708
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,720
What?

709
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,400
What kind of crazy jerk ordered food at a crime site?

710
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,600
Me.

711
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,840
Yes, this is it.

712
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,920
This must be the liver.

713
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,960
Moo Gang couldn't eat stuff like that before.

714
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,320
What's this? I got something.

715
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,560
Get him!

716
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,480
I guess this is why everyone prefers to be in this world no matter what.

717
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,320
Are you really Moo Gang?

718
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,120
My gosh.

719
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,160
- Hey, come on. - No way.

720
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,880
Hey, don't tell me...

721
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,520
Moo Gang.

722
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,600
Hey, get off the car.

723
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,480
My gosh.

724
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,880
- Get off. - You crazy jerk.

725
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,600
- My gosh. - Hey, listen to me.

726
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,160
- I need to go somewhere. - Hey.

727
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,280
- That's my gun. - No.

728
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,520
No, you can't have it.

729
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,120
- Give me back my gun! - My gosh.

730
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,480
- Stay still. - My gosh, just go inside.

731
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,600
He can't recognize both me and Soo Wan.

732
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,960
I don't think he remembers anything.

733
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,640
His colleagues told me that he does things that...

734
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,320
he normally wouldn't have done in the past.

735
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,560
It could be a temporary memory loss due to shock.

736
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,000
So let's give him some time.

737
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,960
How could you do this to me?

738
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,560
How?

739
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,280
I'm sorry, Moo Gang.

740
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,800
I know I should've told you everything from the beginning.

741
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,280
But I was scared that you might end up leaving me.

742
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,920
Yes.

743
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,400
Maybe it's for the best.

744
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,720
His memory might not even come back at all.

745
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,560
Then Moo Gang and I...

746
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,640
will be able to go back to how we used to be.

747
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,520
Joon, I'm...

748
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,600
I'm... I'm Ha Ram.

749
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,560
Do you remember the outcast at Moojin Elementary School?

750
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,600
The shaman kid with sunglasses.

751
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,960
Get lost.

752
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,960
My gosh. First love, my foot.

753
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,000
Everything's useless.

754
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,680
(Royeol Insurance)

755
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,600
Look at this. "President Oh Man Soo".

756
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,200
(Sang Min: I told you so.)

757
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,840
(Rumor says that Royeol Insurance might get sold due to bankruptcy.)

758
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,960
Give me last year and this year's...

759
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,400
business reports and financial statements.

760
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,280
I also want all the documents regarding the insurance settlements.

761
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,440
I'm not sure if I should be saying this to you,

762
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,520
but there really is no hope.

763
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,960
It's worse than I had expected.

764
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,080
Yes.

765
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,960
Hello, ma'am.

766
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,880
I just wired you the deposit money,

767
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,160
so give it a check.

768
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,240
What? What do you mean?

769
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,120
Your dad just came earlier...

770
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,360
and told me that you're going to move out.

771
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,480
What? I don't have a dad.

772
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,080
My gosh, this jerk.

773
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,000
Open the door. I know you're inside.

774
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,480
Give me back my money! My gosh!

775
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,880
Give me back my deposit money!

776
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,720
Give it back!

777
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,400
Dad's not here.

778
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,080
My gosh.

779
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,280
There it is. I found it.

780
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,800
What?

781
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,320
What is this?

782
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,520
Oh, that's Mom's.

783
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,880
She looks at it from time to time,

784
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,040
but she cries every time she sees it.

785
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,240
She cries?

786
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,600
This is Dad's.

787
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,120
(Moojin Regional Police Agency, Kang Soo Hyuk)

788
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,640
"I don't think your husband's death was caused by loss of footing."

789
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,800
"I'd like to meet with you in secret."

790
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,440
Dad!

791
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,360
Dad.

792
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,680
That shadow.

793
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,960
It's okay.

794
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Ha Ram.

795
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,640
Can you try to foresee...

796
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,120
how Dad will die?

797
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,720
Someone will push you.

798
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,480
A spider is drawn on his hand.

799
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,800
Spider?

800
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360
Okay.

801
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,880
I'll catch that scoundrel before he can do anything, so don't worry.

802
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,880
I'll be back soon, okay?

803
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,960
No! Dad, don't go.

804
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,520
It's okay. Dad won't die.

805
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,560
I'll catch that bad guy and come home very soon.

806
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,080
No! Dad, no!

807
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,240
No! Don't go!

808
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,680
No, Dad!

809
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,560
The number you've dialed is not in service.

810
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,200
How may I help you?

811
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,480
Chunsu Insurance, please.

812
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,480
No phone number is found for Chunsu Insurance.

813
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,320
What? It doesn't exist anymore?

814
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,080
Hey, where's that woman?

815
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,720
Can you not call Mom like that? That's so rude.

816
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,240
I asked you where that woman is now!

817
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,800
She's obviously working at the hospital now.

818
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,360
Dad!

819
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,120
- Dad! - My gosh.

820
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,560
Go stay with your mom, okay?

821
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,320
- Dad... - I'll take you to your mom.

822
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,760
That man killed my dad. That man over there.

823
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,120
Who?

824
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,880
He has a spider drawn on his hand.

825
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,360
Where did he go?

826
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,240
What is this?

827
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,400
Answer me.

828
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,400
Don't cause a scene here. Let's talk outside.

829
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,560
Come out.

830
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,120
This person said it wasn't an accident, right? Someone killed Dad.

831
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,800
Who did it? Does he know who the killer is?

832
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,640
Why didn't you report this to the police right away?

833
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,040
I didn't meet that person.

834
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,120
What? What did you just say?

835
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,840
Are you deaf or what?

836
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,600
I never called.

837
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,960
Well...

838
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,200
You didn't call that person after reading this?

839
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,560
Why? Why didn't you call?

840
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,560
Why didn't you meet that person?

841
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,400
Your dad's death was an accident.

842
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,520
Why do I have to listen to such nonsense?

843
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,440
I mean, what will it change? Will it bring your dad back to life?

844
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,200
Well...

845
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,440
You read this, didn't you?

846
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,960
How could you do that?

847
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,040
You should've at least met him and heard what he had to say.

848
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,680
How...

849
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,480
How could you not meet someone who wants to tell you how Dad died?

850
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,480
How could you not even meet him?

851
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,200
I told you that I saw it.

852
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,120
I clearly told you. I saw what happened with my own two eyes.

853
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,520
I saw a man pushing Dad and killing him.

854
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,080
Why don't you believe me when I'm telling you that I saw it?

855
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,600
Why is it that no one believes me?

856
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,760
You wench.

857
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,080
Listen.

858
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,520
I told you to keep your lips sealed.

859
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,440
I said you should pretend you can't foresee anything!

860
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,320
Who do you think you are?

861
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
Why do I have to listen to you?

862
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,560
You...

863
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,680
left me and Dad,

864
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,720
and you even turned a blind eye to Dad's wrongful death.

865
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,040
Had you...

866
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,160
met this person back then,

867
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,960
had you listened to this person and reported it to the police,

868
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,600
that murderer who killed Dad...

869
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,760
would've been caught.

870
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,360
You're not any better than the murderer who took Dad's life!

871
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,640
Back then,

872
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,560
whether your dad lost his footing and fell to death...

873
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,320
or was murdered,

874
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,160
it didn't matter to me.

875
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,080
I didn't want to care!

876
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,200
But still,

877
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,800
he was your husband.

878
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,520
What did he do so wrong?

879
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,560
What did we do so wrong to you?

880
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,480
What was wrong?

881
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,520
Everything was wrong from the get-go.

882
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,480
Every single thing was wrong. That day at that place,

883
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,240
Kang Soo Hyuk had to die.

884
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,560
What?

885
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,960
That's right.

886
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,320
Everything was wrong.

887
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,400
Every single thing that happened,

888
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,840
including falling in love with him...

889
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,960
and giving birth to you.

890
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,240
What?

891
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,200
- No, we can't. We can't do that. - But...

892
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,640
The police can look up information on people though.

893
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,240
I just need the address.

894
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,720
We can't look up information on people just because you want us to.

895
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
Please leave now.

896
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,160
Wait, Officer. Officer!

897
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,120
How heartless.

898
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,200
That's right. Joon is a detective.

899
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,560
He checked out? Already?

900
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,720
Yes.

901
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,800
But...

902
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,640
The customer you're calling is unavailable at the moment.

903
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,960
Excuse me.

904
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,200
Would I be able to get Detective Han's address from you?

905
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,640
We cannot give out our patients' personal information.

906
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,280
I see.

907
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,440
Gosh. What should I do, then?

908
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,720
Oh, right.

909
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,160
Would he still live at the same place?

910
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,320
Where was it? Right, the letter.

911
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,520
It's at home. I need that letter.

912
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,680
Well...

913
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,080
Moo Gang.

914
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,280
You really should stay with me at my place today.

915
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,560
For the next few days, I'll...

916
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,080
Gosh, wait.

917
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,280
All right. Just a second.

918
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,640
This is the passcode for the door.

919
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,440
Please don't worry too much.

920
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,880
Doctor Hwang said that it'll only be temporary.

921
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,560
Yes, I'm sure it is.

922
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,320
How tacky.

923
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,800
Gosh.

924
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,640
Darn it.

925
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,800
Let's see.

926
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,240
(To: Joon)

927
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,440
Right, Myeonhee-dong.

928
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,960
I hope he still lives there.

929
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,000
Who are you?

930
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,680
You hid it here.

931
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,800
It took me so long to find this.

932
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,560
- You can't take it. Give it back. - Let me borrow it, will you?

933
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,800
Give me back my money.

934
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,800
You can charge me hefty interest.

935
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,680
Give it back. And I want my rent deposit back too.

936
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,680
I'll be kicked out of this place without that money.

937
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,680
Your rent deposit?

938
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,720
I know that you created a bank account using my name.

939
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,920
Oh, that.

940
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,560
That was transferred to a loan shark's account a long time ago.

941
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,280
That's all I had.

942
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,920
Do you know what I went through to save that money?

943
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,360
Don't you worry.

944
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,840
I'll hit the jackpot with this money...

945
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,040
and pay you back right away with interest.

946
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,440
By the way, all you do is hide in the house like a pathetic loner.

947
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,480
How did you manage to save up this much?

948
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,760
Do you earn money from giving people fortune-telling readings?

949
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,520
Yes, that's how I made all that money.

950
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,480
You know how good I am, right?

951
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,560
I do, you wench.

952
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,600
You're cursed.

953
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,920
That's why your dad died.

954
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,520
That's right.

955
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,640
My dad died because of me.

956
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,680
Shall I kill you too?

957
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,560
What? What did you just say?

958
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,520
Are you deaf?

959
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,280
I'll give you a reading since I'm not wearing my sunglasses.

960
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,280
Goodness, you stupid wench.

961
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,920
I raised you for years.

962
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,280
You should be thanking me. How can you talk like that to your stepdad?

963
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,360
Wait!

964
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,560
If you take that money,

965
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,600
you'll die before you can even take 10 steps.

966
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,000
And you won't just die.

967
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,120
What?

968
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,640
That crazy wench.

969
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,880
This is insane! I shouldn't have seen it!

970
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,360
How can someone die like that?

971
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,120
My gosh!

972
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,000
You crazy wench.

973
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,200
Don't put on a show!

974
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,640
How can someone die like that?

975
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,640
Go away! Go! Get out of my face!

976
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,160
I don't care. If I don't take this money,

977
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,160
those jerks will kill me anyway.

978
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,480
Wait, no!

979
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,560
No, no. You can't leave.

980
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,720
Let go, you wench!

981
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,000
Joon.

982
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,760
Joon.

983
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,479
Joon.

984
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,080
Joon.

985
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,080
Ha Ram.

986
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,319
You shouldn't fall asleep here.

987
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,920
You'll catch a cold. Wake up already.

988
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,120
Joon.

989
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,680
Is it you, Joon?

990
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,120
Joon.

991
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,279
Joon.

992
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,440
Why did you never write me back?

993
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,400
I waited for your letter every day.

994
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,960
Joon.

995
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,440
Why did you pretend not to know me?

996
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,240
Why?

997
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,920
Joon.

998
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,480
No, no, no! No...

999
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,160
Joon.

1000
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,320
Who are you?

1001
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,440
Joon.

1002
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,680
Are you dead?

1003
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,520
Joon...

1004
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,960
Goodness.

1005
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,280
Is there a big hole in the sky or what?

1006
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,360
Why is it pouring so hard?

1007
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,680
What happened? You haven't found him yet?

1008
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,360
I think he already got out of the area.

1009
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,680
Darn it.

1010
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,600
Have you managed to identify him?

1011
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:09,920
Well, that's...

1012
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,840
About the murder suspect of the mental hospital case...

1013
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,840
I heard all the records have been deleted.

1014
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,280
What?

1015
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,840
All the records are gone.

1016
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,480
I'm calling about the murder suspect of the Hope Mental Hospital case.

1017
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,960
Have you guys found any fingerprints or DNA?

1018
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,120
All right.

1019
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
- Nothing has been found. - Goodness.

1020
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,640
They've found nothing?

1021
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,480
How is that possible?

1022
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,520
He ate and slept in that room.

1023
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,360
That jerk must've deleted all hospital records...

1024
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,720
as well as his traces and DNA before he fled.

1025
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,760
Seriously?

1026
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,560
Don't think of him as just a crazy guy.

1027
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,760
The murder was meticulously premeditated.

1028
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,680
I bet he had an elaborate plan to make sure he can kill the director.

1029
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,440
What is it, then?

1030
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,480
That means Moo Gang was right.

1031
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,520
He didn't just stab her anywhere.

1032
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,200
He purposely stabbed her...

1033
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,040
only in places that cause the most severe pain.

1034
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,960
He stabbed and twisted the knife.

1035
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,800
He watched her die a very painful death.

1036
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,920
Gosh, what happened to Moo Gang?

1037
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,280
He's acting like a totally different person.

1038
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,480
I asked you who you are.

1039
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,560
He must be fated to live such a long life.

1040
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,560
I should've pulled his eyes out back then.

1041
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,160
This man will die!

1042
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:09,720
If you don't come out, this jerk will really die.

1043
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,640
What? What? What are you looking at?

1044
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,520
Stop hiding already.

1045
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,440
I'll really kill this guy!

1046
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,640
Don't come near me. Stay away.

1047
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,800
Or I'm really going to kill him.

1048
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,960
I said, I'm really going to kill him!

1049
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,080
This is a real gun.

1050
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,480
Shoot him.

1051
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,320
We'll get punished for being an accomplice.

1052
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,040
I can't watch you get harmed.

1053
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,800
I'm going to catch you with my own two hands.

1054
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,040
You may not remember this.

1055
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,040
Clear! Shoot!

1056
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,040
You died back then, Moo Gang.

1057
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,840
What?

1058
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,400
Who are you?

1059
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,760
Me?

1060
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,680
(Black)

1061
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,360
He might act weird,

1062
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,960
but let's just think of it as a mental illness.

1063
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,040
Moo Gang! No!

1064
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,160
I can't take your soul to the afterlife yet.

1065
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,600
Just wait a little more.

1066
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,000
He would've come after me if I had told him.

1067
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,360
Remember that woman who you said was going to die? She got murdered.

1068
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,600
Did that guy almost die a couple days ago?

1069
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,600
There's a shadow inside his body.

1070
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,320
Did you think I'd never be able to find you?
