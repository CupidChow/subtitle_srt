1
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,560
You should've laid low and behaved yourself when I let you live.

2
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,600
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,240
What's happening? Why can't I get out of here?

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
What is going on?

5
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
Why can't I get out of here?

6
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,560
Gosh, who was it?

7
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,479
I clearly saw it.

8
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,720
By the way, where did Joon go?

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
Why can't I get out?

10
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Why can't I...

11
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,240
get out of this body?

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
Joon, were you here the whole time?

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,520
I looked everywhere for you.

14
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,680
Actually, there's something urgent.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,200
When the power went out earlier,

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
I saw a moment of death.

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,520
It might've been an abduction case. The person was tied to a chair.

18
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,880
Then the building exploded.

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,040
Why did that girl pop into my mind when I was about to die?

20
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
I can't understand it. How unpleasant.

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,480
Joon.

22
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,920
Joon, you're listening, right?

23
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
Yes.

24
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,920
What about Leo?

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,640
I checked right away, but it wasn't him.

26
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,280
I checked people around him, and I don't think it's them either.

27
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480
I have no idea who it was.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,600
I'll get out soon. Give me a minute.

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,440
Someone will die.

30
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm tired. Let's leave.

31
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,600
This is crazy. I must've lost my mind.

32
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,240
She's really not my type.

33
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
Hey, Mr. Green.

34
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,400
It looks like Joe Black is abducting Princess Green.

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,640
Will you let him leave with her, Mr. Green?

36
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,960
Cut it out, okay?

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,320
Gosh, you're making me feel embarrassed.

38
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,400
What's the matter with you? I was just joking.

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,120
Hey, why are you drinking so much?

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,600
You'll black out again.

41
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,440
You don't remember a thing when you black out.

42
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,760
Stop drinking. You'll make a mistake.

43
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,200
Let go. Hey!

44
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,440
That shadow...

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,720
Who could it be?

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,960
They're never around when I need them.

47
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,080
Why aren't they back yet?

48
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
Why are you getting back just now?

49
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
Why are you welcoming us so enthusiastically?

50
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,680
You must have a hidden agenda.

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,360
Come on! You better tell us the facts.

52
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
It's "truth".

53
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,240
- It's "facts". - It's "truth".

54
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,200
- "Facts". - Be quiet. Listen up, guys.

55
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,960
I can't get out. I cannot get out of this body.

56
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,120
What? What do you mean?

57
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,320
Look at this.

58
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,320
This body fell into a river and died after some jerk stabbed me.

59
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm certain that it died. It fell into a river and died.

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
But I couldn't get out of it.

61
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,040
That's why it's alive again now. Does this make sense to you?

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,680
Gosh, no way.

63
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
416.

64
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,480
Do I look like I'm lying now?

65
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,640
Do I? Look at me.

66
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,800
What are you doing now? Are you trying to poop or what?

67
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,320
I can't get out. I can't leave this body.

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,280
Sorry? We can go in and out of human bodies freely...

69
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,040
after entering them.

70
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,160
Exactly. But I can't get out of this body.

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
No matter how hard I try, I just can't leave this body.

72
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,200
007, why is this happening? Say something.

73
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
Well, I'm not sure.

74
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,920
I've never been through anything like this even in the Joseon era.

75
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,400
Then hurry up, and look into it.

76
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,040
Find out why this is happening to me, would you?

77
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,040
What if I can't get out of this body even after catching that loser?

78
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I'll be doomed.

79
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,600
Okay, I heard you.

80
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,120
But try to look at the bright side.

81
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
As long as you're locked up in that body,

82
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,760
it'll be invincible and immortal no matter how many times...

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,040
that jerk who's after Han Moo Gang tries to kill him.

84
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,480
That means you'll be able to continue using his body.

85
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,760
- Really? - Yes.

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Am I supposed to be happy about this or what?

87
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,320
Why did you kill Han Moo Gang?

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,400
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,880
I lost my reason momentarily.

90
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,280
If we kill Han Moo Gang, that jerk won't let it slide!

91
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,880
I'll make sure there are no further problems.

92
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,720
And I'll take care of the body before it gets found.

93
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,920
You didn't have to kill Moo Gang!

94
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Shut it before I rip your mouth off.

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,520
It's me.

96
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,880
What happened to the informant tailing Moo Gang?

97
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,159
Still?

98
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,560
The situation is quite urgent now. Find that jerk immediately.

99
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
What?

100
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,160
Why am I here?

101
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm supposed to be in Ha Ram's storage.

102
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,640
- Side effects? - That's right.

103
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,960
You might not be able to teleport as you please.

104
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,600
I can't teleport? Why not?

105
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,760
You have dreams now. That means you're becoming more and more human.

106
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,760
Humans cannot teleport, can they?

107
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
What is this?

108
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Am I really becoming a human?

109
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,840
I won't be able to get out of this body or teleport.

110
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,400
Han Moo Gang's body is gone? What do you mean?

111
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,560
Have you looked everywhere?

112
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,320
Search the bottom of the lake if you have to!

113
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,320
These idiots.

114
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
What?

115
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,080
He's not dead.

116
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,720
I'm busy, but I have to walk like those stupid humans?

117
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,200
Isn't this a car key?

118
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
That's right.

119
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Where is it?

120
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,960
Yes, this is it.

121
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
All right.

122
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I've spent ages in cars waiting to take those who die in car accidents.

123
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,200
This will be a piece of cake.

124
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,560
Where is the key?

125
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
Where should I put it in?

126
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
There.

127
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Good. Oh, gosh.

128
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,000
I can do this.

129
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,320
I can do this. Of course I can.

130
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
Hello?

131
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,800
What?

132
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,040
My dad?

133
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes. Okay.

134
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Yes, I just got here. Where should I go?

135
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,840
That man...

136
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,680
- Hey! - Just die! Die already, please!

137
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,520
Let go of me!

138
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Ms. Fortune-teller.

139
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
Hurry!

140
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,080
Hurry up!

141
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
What do you think?

142
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Do you see it?

143
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,360
Hey, you brat.

144
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,920
I told you to never come here.

145
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
What... What are you doing?

146
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,120
Who are you?

147
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Get off me!

148
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,240
Are you okay?

149
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's go.

150
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,720
Why that little...

151
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Hi, Lawyer Jung.

152
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,880
Did you copy it?

153
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,600
Bring it to my office.

154
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,120
The person who killed that man was wearing the same watch.

155
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,800
Does that mean the person who will kill that man...

156
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
will kill Mr. Oh's dad as well?

157
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,200
Listen.

158
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,640
Don't be so discouraged. Let's wait a little longer.

159
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,960
He has survived crises worse than this.

160
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
- Hello. - Okay then.

161
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,920
- What is it? - It's about Yoon Soo Wan.

162
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,240
She handed in her resignation, and I can't reach her. What's going on?

163
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
She... She handed in her resignation?

164
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,840
You didn't know about this? Here.

165
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,320
(Letter of Resignation)

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hold on.

167
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,520
The phone is turned off...

168
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,360
Her phone is off.

169
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,160
What happened to her?

170
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
Did the man who was here leave?

171
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,080
You mean that grump? He left earlier.

172
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,440
- Where is her other guardian? - She didn't come here today.

173
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
(Kim Soon Hee)

174
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,920
She must've seen something again.

175
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,120
I told her not to get involved in it.

176
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,680
Please help me this once.

177
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,640
I told you. I can't give you the patient's personal information.

178
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,200
What should I do?

179
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,320
Listen. You can give it to a police officer, right?

180
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
What?

181
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,360
So please come to Royeol Hospital now, and check it for me.

182
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,520
Hello? Hello...

183
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,360
There she goes again. It wasn't easy for me to come this far!

184
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,600
Have you seen someone wearing a watch...

185
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,360
with a butterfly shape around your dad?

186
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,040
I'm not sure.

187
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,200
I should call the police.

188
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,960
No one would believe me.

189
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,800
What should we do then?

190
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,040
Don't worry too much.

191
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,240
There will be a way to catch the killer.

192
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,360
- But... But how? - Before...

193
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,480
he kills your dad,

194
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,360
he will kill someone else first.

195
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
- What? - It's the husband...

196
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,440
of a patient in this hospital.

197
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,000
I saw the killer stabbing him to death.

198
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,520
How can you be sure it's the same person?

199
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,560
You said you didn't see his face.

200
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,800
His watch. He was wearing the same watch.

201
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,920
But...

202
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
that can't be the only watch of its' kind.

203
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,040
The bloodstain he got on his watch when he killed the husband...

204
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,400
was still there...

205
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,320
when he was removing your dad's respirator.

206
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,160
There may be many watches which look alike,

207
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,280
but the bloodstain can't be the same, can it?

208
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,440
So there is still a chance.

209
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,080
If we catch the killer before he kills the husband,

210
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,080
your dad may be fine as well.

211
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,240
So if we catch him when he tries...

212
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
to kill the husband...

213
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,920
Then my dad won't die either.

214
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,240
- Who would try to kill those two? - I don't know.

215
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Did you find out?

216
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,720
His phone is turned off. This is his address.

217
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,080
Let's hurry up and go.

218
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
What?

219
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Let go of me.

220
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,320
How persistent.

221
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,360
You're such a nosy person.

222
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,920
You hold my hand whenever you want.

223
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
Fine, I won't hold your hand. Let's hurry off.

224
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,119
Wait. Let me come with you.

225
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,040
You should stay here.

226
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Don't leave your dad's side,

227
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,040
and call me if someone comes to your mind.

228
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't worry too much. We'll catch the killer.

229
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,520
- Thank you. - What are you doing? I'm busy.

230
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Hello?

Ha Ram!

235
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,680
Seung Chul.

236
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,760
Did Joon write you back?

237
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,560
He must be busy trying to get accustomed to Seoul.

238
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,920
Are you wearing that again because Joon isn't around?

239
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,360
He told you not to cover your pretty eyes.

240
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,960
Take it off.

241
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,040
I’m going to tell him everything if you wear them again.

242
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,920
Gosh, I might be late. See you!

243
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,000
Seung Chul! The shadow...

244
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,000
The shadow...

245
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,400
Ha Ram, what's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

246
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,640
Don't... Don't go. Don't go to the movies.

247
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
What?

248
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,640
Are you talking about going to the movies as a group tomorrow?

249
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,600
Tomorrow? Is it tomorrow?

250
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,120
Don't... Don't go. Please don't go there.

251

Hey, Seung Chul.

255

All right, Hyun Soo. Let's go together.

256
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,160
Don't... Don't go. Don't go there.

257
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Okay, I won't go to the movies.

258
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
You should get going. I'll go now.

What's the matter with that kid?

261
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
It's nothing.

262
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,200
Back then,

263
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
I was too young.

264
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,880
I should’ve held on to you more tightly.

265
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
I should've tried harder to make sure you didn't go there.

266
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,240
Is it someone you know?

267

Back in elementary school,

268
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,880
he was your closest friend.

He was my friend?

20 years ago,

275
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,280
a newly built mall in Moojin collapsed.

276
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,640
In the theater on the fifth floor of the mall,

277
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,760
seventh graders from Moojin Middle School...

278
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,880
were watching a movie altogether that day.

279
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,200
That accident...

280
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,640
killed nearly 300 people.

281
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,960
Even though so many people died,

282
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
we still don't know why that building collapsed,

283
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
and...

284
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,920
what kind of corruption took place in the construction process.

285
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,640
The truth wasn't fully revealed yet,

286
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,280
but the case just got buried away.

287

Why?

288
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
The building owner, Woo Byung Sik,

289
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,560
tried to flee abroad with all related documents.

290
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,840
But he got into a rollover accident on his way to the airport...

291
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,320
and was found completely burnt.

292

but no one was responsible for the disaster. It was total nonsense.

He actually told his parents he didn't want to go because...

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,280
You should pray that you can fully recover soon.

333
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Gosh, my baby.

334
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,880
And this is for you.

335
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Mom and Dad will stay at the prayer center for about a week.

336
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,920
Watch movies and buy yourself some good food.

337
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,440
You should take your friends to the karaoke too.

338
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,840
Where did you get this money?

339
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
Mom, where's your ring?

340
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,960
She took it to a pawnshop...

341
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
so that you can watch the movie and hang out with your friends.

342
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,320
Gosh, you didn't have to say that.

343
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,800
I'll start working again when I get better,

344
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,320
so I'll be able to get my ring back very soon. Don't worry.

345
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,520
Mom.

346
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,760
Get going. Go, and have fun, okay?

347
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,800
You don't need to be frugal. Just spend it all. All right?

348
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,640
And don't skip meals while we're gone.

349
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,240
Order some jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk with your friends.

350
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,400
- Wait for further information. - Please calm down. We're...

351
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,720
We're really doing our best now, so please...

352
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,520
- When the investigation is done... - Kyung Min.

353
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,560
Officer, I'm here for my son, Seung Chul.

354
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,440
The accident happened a while ago. Why didn't you come sooner?

355
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,840
We didn't know because we were at a prayer center in the mountains.

356
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
What's his name?

357
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,760
Park Seung Chul.

358
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,400
Grade 7 Class 3 at Moojin Middle School.

359
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,560
His name isn't on the death roll.

360
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,280
Thank you so much.

361
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,240
The building collapsed, so we haven't collected all bodies yet.

362
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Park Seung Chul.

363
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Just a moment, please.

364
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,840
Please check.

365
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,520
What... What is this?

366
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,960
Seung Chul's friend said that it is his hand.

367
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,160
Before heading to the theater, they stopped by a pawnshop together...

368
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,480
to get his mom's ring. He wore it to make sure he doesn't lose it.

369
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,680
Please check it, and make sure that it's your ring, ma'am.

370
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,680
No, it can't be our dear Seung Chul...

371
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Try this. I picked the leaves and brewed it myself.

372
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,880
I'm the chairman of the Truth Commission...

373
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,680
on the Time Mart collapse disaster, Pastor Kang Dong Chul.

374
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,200
It happened 20 years ago,

375
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,720
so most people have forgotten about the accident.

376
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,120
Thank you very much for visiting us.

377
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,400
Do you know this man?

378
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,240
Yes, he's Mr. Park, Seung Chul's father. I know him well.

379
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
I can't get a hold of him.

380
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
I was wondering if you know where he might be.

381
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,440
Actually, we haven't spoken to him for quite a while now.

382
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,400
He had some conflicts with other victims' families.

383
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,040
Conflicts? Like what?

384
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,600
It was because of Seung Chul's mother.

385
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
What about his mother?

386
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,080
After losing Seung Chul like that,

387
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
the two of them came to our church and prayed a lot.

388
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,600
They even served as representatives of the bereaved at one point,

389
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,480
but she received...

390
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,960
settlement money from the company...

391
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,920
to keep our lips sealed behind other families' back.

392
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,640
The media found out about it...

393
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,640
and made it look like all victims' families were...

394
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,480
trying to use their children's deaths to earn money,

395
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,000
so we lost the people's support and couldn't reveal the truth.

396
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,240
All other victims' families as well as Seung Chul's dad...

397
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,880
felt extremely betrayed by her.

398
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,920
I heard she ended up leaving the country with the settlement money.

399
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,680
That left Mr. Park devastated.

400
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,640
After that, he started falling apart and lost his faith as well.

401
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,880
Then that incident broke out.

402
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,320
Incident?

403
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,120
People started to suspect...

404
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
that the donation was being used for other purposes.

405
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,480
Other families brought it up and suspected that it was his doing...

406
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,520
because of what his wife had done in the past.

407
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,880
He had a big fight with a few families because of that.

408
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,600
And he never came back since that day.

409
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,240
I tried calling him, but he wouldn't answer.

410
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
By the way,

411
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,880
did something happen...

412
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,880
to Mr. Park?

413
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,880
Well... No. Nothing has happened to him yet.

414
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,440
Gosh, it's hot.

415
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,400
- Oh, dear. Goodness. - Gosh.

416
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,840
Are you okay?

417
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,960
Yes, I'm okay.

418
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,880
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

419
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,600
Gosh, that was clumsy of you.

420
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,080
He's lying.

421
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,400
What? About what?

422
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,040
He lied about not seeing Mr. Park for a long time.

423
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,800
He went to that house.

424
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,760
And it was very recent.

425
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,960
That house? You mean Seung Chul's house?

426
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,640
How did you know that?

427
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,720
His shoes match the prints on the blanket.

428
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,160
But why would a pastor lie to us?

429
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,200
Do you think pastors never lie?

430
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,080
What is this?

431
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,560
This picture was also at that old man's hospital lobby.

432
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,960
Is this Mr. Oh's dad?

433
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,320
The pastor is suspicious.

434
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,560
He's related to both Mr. Park and Mr. Oh's dad.

435
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,800
Excuse me.

436
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,000
But you really haven't heard anything about Mr. Park, right?

437
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,920
You haven't seen him...

438
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,040
or visited his house recently, right?

439
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,160
No. I'm also curious how he's doing these days.

440
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,200
Hi, Mr. Oh. Do you know Pastor Kang Dong Chul?

441
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,680
Pastor Kang?

442
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,440
Of course.

443
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,160
How do you know him?

444
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,200
My dad has made donations to the families...

445
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,840
of the Moojin Time Mart incident victims for a long time.

446
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,160
I heard he and Pastor Kang met in the process.

447
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,560
After my dad collapsed,

448
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,280
he came to see my dad and pray for him once a month.

449
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,680
I'm very grateful to him.

450
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,520
But why are you asking about him?

451
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,360
It's not certain yet,

452
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,360
but he's suspicious.

453
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,240
He's also related to the man I told you about.

454
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,440
It looked like he hasn't visited my dad for a while.

455
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,560
Really? Could you find out if something happened to him recently?

456
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Okay.

457
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,600
But...

458
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,120
why do you think he snuck into Seung Chul's dad's house?

459
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,920
He came outside.

460
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,560
(Royeol Insurance)

461
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,800
- What about the original copy? - It has been placed...

462
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,680
in the safe.

463
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,880
Okay. You can go now.

464
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,680
Excuse me, Man Ho.

465
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,280
Don't you know how to knock?

466
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,280
I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.

467
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,200
But why isn't Pastor Kang coming to see Dad these days?

468
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,880
He came to pray for Dad once a week.

469
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,240
Pastor, my foot.

470
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,320
- He's a total fraud. - What?

471
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,280
Before Dad collapsed,

472
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,600
he stopped making donations to the victims of Time Mart something.

473
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,880
- Why? - How should I know that?

474
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,120
Anyway, that man came to me and begged me to support them again.

475
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,400
So I told him I'd think about it after Dad dies. What a scumbag.

476
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,160
But why are you suddenly asking about him?

477
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,600
It was nothing. I'll get going now.

478
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,840
Gosh, that brat.

479
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,880
Lastly, I will leave Royeol Electronics...

480
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,280
to my youngest son, Man Soo.

481
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
That senile old man.

482
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Who does he think made Royeol into what it is now?

483
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,160
What? Your dad stopped making donations?

484
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,040
Yes. I checked it out,

485
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,680
and the amount of money he had donated to them is quite big.

486
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,440
Why do you think he stopped it so suddenly?

487
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,560
- Oh, gosh. - Goodness!

488
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,960
Ms. Fortune-teller. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

489
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,080
- No, I'm... I'm fine. - That jerk.

490
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,880
You're such a terrible driver.

491
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,360
- You used to be a good driver. - Be quiet.

492
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
This is harder than it looks.

493
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,840
It looked easier when I watched it.

494
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,320
We're almost there.

495
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,120
(Kang Dong Chul)

496
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,120
Unbelievable.

497
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,960
He was the one who embezzled the donations, not Seung Chul's dad.

498
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,600
Mr. Oh's dad must've stopped making donations because he found out.

499
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,240
Just a moment. I'll call you right back.

500
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,440
Humans never disappoint me.

501
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,040
I can imagine why he would try to kill Mr. Oh's dad,

502
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,560
but I still don't know why he'd kill Seung Chul's dad.

503
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,199
Do you think...

504
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,040
Pastor Kang really is the killer I saw in the shadow?

505
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,920
If he has that watch in his house, won't it become clear?

506
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,480
Yes, it will.

507
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,000
- Wait here. - What are you going to do?

508
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,719
I'm a detective. This is a piece of cake.

509
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,400
Yes. This is the watch I saw.

510
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,480
Let's capture him right now.

511
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,640
- On what grounds? - What?

512
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,160
The things you said can't be evidence. Don't you know that?

513
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,560
Then what should we do?

514
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,840
There must be a reason he ransacked Seung Chul's house.

515
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,360
We should find that out.

516
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,640
There's a fly here.

517
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,040
- Gosh. - Joon!

518
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
- What is this? - You surprised me.

519
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
What's this?

520
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Joon.

521
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,000
This is the evidence of Pastor Kang's embezzlement.

522
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,240
Yes.

523
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,280
I think Mr. Park has carefully gathered these for a long time.

524
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,120
This must be the reason why he wanted to kill Mr. Park.

525
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,160
- Get out now. - Let go of me.

526
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,600
You! Were you on that jerk's side?

527
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,640
You devils!

528
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
- Quiet! - You're the devil.

529
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,160
You devils!

530
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,520
I want to kill that man.

531
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,800
It's all over now, right?

532
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,520
Seung Chul's dad and Mr. Oh's dad will both be fine, right?

533
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,920
Probably. That punk has been arrested.

534
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,120
But still, I should see him to be at ease.

535
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,160
Stop talking nonsense.

536
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,880
Let's go now.

537
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,160
Hello?

538
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,120
I'm calling from Royeol Hospital.

539
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,840
You told me to call when the patient's guardian came.

540
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,680
He's in the hospital room right now.

541
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,760
(World Drink)

542
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,720
(World Drink)

543
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,160
Get off.

544
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,720
What do you think you're doing?

545
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,640
It was him.

546
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,520
Hey, Ha Ram.

547
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,800
You might cross paths, so I'll just wait here and check if he comes out.

548
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,800
Call me right away if you see Seung Chul's dad.

549
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,040
What?

550
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,040
Is this guy really the culprit?

551
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,640
How annoying.

552
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,760
You thief!

553
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,560
Oh, you're Detective Han. What are you doing here?

554
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,440
This...

555
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,800
I'm sorry. I wasn't planning on stealing it at first.

556
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,000
What?

557
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,480
You stole it? Isn't this yours?

558
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,120
No. I went to that house because I had to find something.

559
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,240
Is anyone home?

560
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,760
I'm really telling the truth. Please forgive me just this once.

561
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
If he's not the owner of this watch,

562
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,040
does that mean someone else is the murderer?

563
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Are you still looking for the owner of this watch and the man who...

564
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,960
made Han Jin Sook work as a prostitute?

565
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,520
That's why I'm going to Moojin today.

566
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,440
Some of the prostitutes who used to work with Han Jin Sook...

567
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,040
are apparently still living in Moojin.

568
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,040
My gosh, you guys are working so hard.

569
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,120
- Did you eat? - What took you so long?

570
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,720
Eat this while you work.

571
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,680
- What's that? - I got it from a famous restaurant.

572
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,240
Oh, really? Thank you.

573
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,920
What are you doing? Why did you just act that way?

574
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,120
I think he wants to take Han Jin Sook's case from us.

575
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,440
- What? - I overheard him while sleeping.

576
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,960
But he was searching Han Jin Sook's phone call records.

577
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,040
And when we were having a team meeting, I saw him...

578
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,760
trying to eavesdrop on what we were saying.

579
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
Exactly. He's just trying to take this case from us...

580
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,040
because he's not getting anywhere...

581
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,800
with that mental hospital case.

582
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,160
So keep things confidential if you don't want to lose our case to him.

583
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,520
Our team will no longer exist if we lose this case as well. Okay?

584
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,560
Okay.

585
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Why?

586
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,440
What?

587
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
My gosh.

588
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,280
That jerk used to wash my socks when he was a recruit.

589
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,880
My gosh.

590
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,880
- Let's go. - Okay.

591
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,200
Keep up the good work.

592
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,240
- Hey, you can eat this. - Okay. Thank you.

593
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,920
- Bye. - Where's Moo Gang?

594
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,680
Him? My gosh, don't even talk to me about him.

595
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,120
I can't even look at him anymore.

596
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,720
Actually, I'm relieved.

597
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,280
I'm going to think of him as a freelancer for a while.

598
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,560
That's what I'm going to do.

599
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,960
Okay, go ahead.

600
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,800
Think whatever you want.

601
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,640
No one seems to know anything about what happened to Moo Gang.

602
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,120
I'll continue to keep an eye on them.

603
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,640
So don't show up in front of Moo Gang for a while.

604
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,000
Okay.

605
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,160
I'm pretty sure that jerk saw my face.

606
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,760
Why didn't he report me even after he got stabbed?

607
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,680
(World Drink)

608
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,400
(Sunglasses)

609
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,520
Hello?

610
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,840
Didn't you see Seung Chul's dad leaving?

611
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,000
They say he left just now.

612
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,160
No, I didn't see him.

613
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,320
We already caught the culprit,

614
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,280
so I'm sure nothing will happen.

615
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,560
Ms. Fortune-teller.

616
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,840
I heard that Pastor Kang turned out to be the culprit.

617
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,800
I also handed in my dad's donation records to the police.

618
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,200
That ungrateful jerk.

619
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,720
Now that we caught him, does that mean my dad's going to live?

620
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,400
Yes, but...

621
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,440
Why didn't I think of that earlier?

622
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,840
We can just check and see...

623
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,840
if there's still a shadow on your father's body or not.

624
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,720
It seems that Pastor Kang wasn't the culprit.

625
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,240
- What? - What's going on?

626
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,680
If Pastor Kang isn't the culprit, that means he'll be in trouble too.

627
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Wait for me.

628
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,120
(Office, World Drink)

629
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,760
Good work.

630
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,240
Thank you, sir.

631
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,360
What is it?

632
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,160
Didn't Mr. Yang tell you off for being late?

633
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,480
Everything was fine.

634
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,440
- I'll go home now. - Okay. Goodbye.

635
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,600
- Bye. - Bye.

636
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,520
I guess she found out.

637
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But you won't be able to save anyone...

638
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
because I'm not going to let you.

639
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,200
I'm 444, the best there is in this business.

640
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,560
What? Wait. Right here.

641
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,200
Why didn't he see him?

642
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,680
Wait.

643
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,240
That's...

644
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,320
Turn on the lights. We need to turn the lights on!

645
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,480
I almost forgot.

646
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,600
About what?

647
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,720
When there was a blackout...

648
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,280
at the party, I saw a shadow.

649
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,720
What?

650
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,920
I couldn't see the person's face because it was too dark.

651
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,560
But that person had a mask on and was kidnapped.

652
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,520
And that coat was also at the scene.

653
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,680
What does that man have anything to do with kidnapping?

654
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,280
What? He's the guy...

655
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,720
who delivered alcohol to the party.

656
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,400
- What? - I remember...

657
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
because I signed the receipt myself.

658
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,360
Yes. It was from World Drink.

659
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,640
Mr. Park?

660
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,960
He just left after bringing back his truck.

661
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,560
What's this?

662
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,640
My gosh, this startled me.

663
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,320
What is this?

664
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,120
What? That's...

665
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,600
He's Steven Yoo.

666
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,440
Hi, man.

667
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,720
What's this doing here?

668
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,840
When the power went out earlier, I saw a moment of death.

669
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,160
It might've been an abduction case. The person was tied to a chair.

670
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,400
Then the building exploded.

671
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
What?

672
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,720
Was that guy the kidnapper?

673
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,520
Sang Min. This is what your friend was wearing at the party, right?

674
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,920
That's Steven's.

675
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,880
Why do you have this?

676
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,680
- Call him right now. - Okay.

677
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,680
The receiver's phone is turned off.

678
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,360
His phone has been turned off.

679
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,120
When was the last time you saw him?

680
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,040
I think he left in the middle of the party.

681
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,960
I guess he thought it was boring. He didn't even say goodbye.

682
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,440
Do you know where he lives?

683
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,160
Yes. He lives in the Philippines.

684
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,640
And right now, he's staying at a hotel in Seoul.

685
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,240
He is staying there with his mom.

686
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,200
Why are you doing this? Why...

687
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
Shut it!

688
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,440
You should resent your father.

689
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,960
Shut it!

690
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,560
Please... Please...

691
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,080
Help!

692
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,880
Is your son really safe?

693
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,240
He already left Korea to go to school.

694
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,600
Who are you to ask me questions about him?

695
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,520
If you don't leave, I'm going to call the police.

696
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,160
Why did you come to Korea?

697
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,920
Why are you here?

698
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,000
We had a Korean housekeeper who took care of Steven as a child.

699
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,240
But she had to come back to Korea because she got into an accident.

700
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,840
We came to visit her because my son got worried about her.

701
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,400
There's no record of him having left Korea.

702
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,400
Why are you lying?

703
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,320
You have to tell us the truth.

704
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,120
Your son's life is on the line.

705
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,880
Your son got kidnapped, right?

706
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
The kidnapper called you, didn't he?

707
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,360
It's Mr. Park Soon Nam, right?

708
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,880
You know who he is, don't you?

709
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,280
No!

710
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,520
I have nothing more to say to you.

711
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,880
So get out of here right now.

712
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,320
Excuse me. Wait. Please.

713
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,160
Mr. Park is going to die soon.

714
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,840
I think he has something to do with this incident.

715
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,560
I wonder why he kidnapped Steven.

716
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,520
Maybe it's because of money. Sang Min told me that...

717
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,720
she raises Steven all by himself, and she's apparently really rich.

718
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,040
If he just wanted money, he would've tried to kill him quietly.

719
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,240
He wouldn't be making such a big issue by installing bombs.

720
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,080
Then I wonder if he's trying to take revenge.

721
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,320
We need to catch him first.

722
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,280
Should we go back to the hospital? He might've gone back again.

723
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,400
It's me.

724
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,240
Some people came and asked me questions about Steven.

725
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,080
What should I do?

726
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,800
What's this?

727
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,280
(Sunglasses)

728
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,600
Who are you?

729
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,640
Why are you following me?

730
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,760
Calm down.

731
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,280
Who are you? What are you?

732
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,680
I warned her that her son's going to die if she tells the police.

733
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,360
I can't believe she still called the police.

734
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,040
Calm down. You might really stab me.

735
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,440
How do you expect me to calm down?

736
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,560
I'm going to kill you too.

737
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,520
I said calm down.

738
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,680
I don't care if you kill anyone or even decide to kill yourself.

739
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,080
You can do whatever you want.

740
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,840
This is...

741
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,000
I'll go to the reception desk and ask if he came by.

742
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,920
Is Ms. Kim Soon Hee's guardian not here?

743
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,200
I think he went somewhere for a while.

744
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,320
I already told him that she needs to get an MRI scan today.

745
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,960
Please tell him if he gets here while she's gone.

746
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,040
It'll take around 30 minutes.

747
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,400
This person...

748
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Why do you have this?

749
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,400
Who does it belong to?

750
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,840
It's the watch that his son was wearing.

751
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,560
He said he got it as a gift from his father.

752
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,840
I figured if I sent his son's watch,

753
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,120
he might get scared and show up.

754
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,800
That's why I kept it at my house.

755
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,480
But how do you have this?

756
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,760
Who's the guy's father?

757
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,120
Woo Byung Sik.

758
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,800
Woo Byung Sik, the man who killed my son.

759
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,160
He's...

760
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,440
The building owner, Woo Byung Sik,

761
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,840
tried to flee abroad with all related documents.

762
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,080
But he got into a rollover accident...

763
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,080
on his way to the airport...

764
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,560
and was found completely burnt.

765
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,680
("A Body Speculated to Be Woo Byung Sik Has Been Found")

766
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,200
I thought this guy was dead.

767
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,720
He's not dead.

768
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,400
Everyone just thinks he's dead.

769
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,400
No.

770
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,400
Everybody knows that he's still alive,

771
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,400
but they're just pretending like they don't know!

772
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,560
Mr. Park didn't come back,

773
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,720
and her cousin left a while ago.

774
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,960
Why?

775
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,360
Woo Byung Sik.

776
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,840
Woo Byung Sik's still alive.

777
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,960
This watch. It's the exact same watch that I saw.

778
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,760
Ms. Fortune-teller. Ms. Fortune-teller.

779
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,160
While everyone was being fooled,

780
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,560
my wife...

781
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,520
My poor wife...

782
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,600
refused to give up.

783
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,280
I thought she deserved to die.

784
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,560
I was cursing at her for betraying our son by getting dirty money.

785
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,080
But she was actually fighting for Seung Chul all by herself.

786
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,040
And I didn't even know that.

787
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,040
- Please just die already! Just die! - Stop it!

788
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,880
Just die already!

789
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,520
What?

790
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,960
This...

791
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,360
This is...

792
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,400
This box was with Soon Hee's other belongings from the Philippines.

793
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,600
And I think she was going to send it to you.

794
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,240
(To Seung Chul's dad)

795
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,280
Honey.

796
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,680
You resented me a lot, didn't you?

797
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,560
I'm sorry.

798
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,600
But I never believed...

799
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,000
that Woo Byung Sik was dead.

800
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,160
(1 year after Time Mart Collapse)

801
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,880
No matter how hard we try,

802
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,520
if we can't prove that Woo Byung Sik is still alive,

803
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,840
we won't be able to find out why our son, Seung Chul,

804
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,720
and all those poor kids had to die.

805
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,600
I realized that we won't be able to bring any truth to light.

806
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,640
That's why I made up my mind...

807
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,800
to find Woo Byung Sik and bring him back to Korea at all costs...

808
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,760
so that he can explain to the people and the bereaved why it happened.

809
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,200
I decided to reveal the truth.

810
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,560
- Reveal the truth! - Reveal the truth!

811
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,440
But I needed money in order to do that.

812
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,320
- Hence, - She received the money!

813
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,880
I received the money for our son's death.

814
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,520
I don't care if the whole world criticizes what I did.

815
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,200
Why did Seung Chul have to die?

816
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,560
Who's responsible for my son's death?

817
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,120
Move over!

818
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,880
I wanted to make them get judged by the law no matter what.

819
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,480
How can you receive that money?

820
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,080
Gosh, she ruined everything!

821
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,880
Whenever I heard that Woo Byung Sik had been spotted,

822
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,840
I went there to catch him regardless of where in the world it was.

823
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,320
Then one day,

824
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,160
I found a woman who was speculated to be his mistress,

825
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,320
and I started working as their housekeeper.

826
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,320
I waited and waited.

827
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,040
I thought that he would...

828
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,440
- show up there eventually. - That's good enough.

829
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,440
I'll give you a few days off so that you can get some rest.

830
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,440
- But... - I'll see you ladies next week.

831
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
What?

832
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,440
Are all of you leaving for the day?

833
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,560
- Yes. - Oh, that's right.

834
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,040
He's coming today. Okay, bye.

835
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,320
I couldn't believe my eyes.

836
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,520
Woo Byung Sik actually...

837
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,480
showed up in front of me.

838
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,760
It's him, isn't it?

839
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,240
Steven. Woo Byung Sik's son.

840
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,080
I met him while I was working at a restaurant.

841
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,480
Back then, I didn't even know that he was Woo Byung Sik.

842
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,280
After that, he bought a house for me in the Philippines,

843
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,200
and I gave birth to Steven and continued living there.

844
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,320
He only visited us once every few months...

845
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,720
and stayed for a couple of days.

846
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,840
That's all.

847
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,240
So after going into hiding,

848
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,800
he lived normally and even had a son.

849
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

850
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,480
Where is he now?

851
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,440
I... I don't know.

852
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,120
Will you let your son die?

853
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,840
I really don't know where he is.

854
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,240
Someone sent me this video,

855
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,320
so I contacted him about it.

856
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,480
- He said he'd take care of it, - If you want your son to live,

857
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,520
- but I haven't been able to... - then...

858
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,200
- get a hold of him since then. - give me a call on this phone.

859
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,800
We should tell the police about this.

860
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,000
No. You absolutely can't do that.

861
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,920
Then... Then Steven will die.

862
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,120
I reached out to the Philippines police,

863
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,640
and they said a witness stated that she fell off the cliff...

864
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,560
after being chased by someone.

865
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,000
It must've been Woo Byung Sik.

866
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,560
He must've been after my wife after finding out what she was up to.

867
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,680
That's why she can't even rest in peace.

868
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,560
I'm just realizing it now.

869
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,800
Detective, you don't have any children, right?

870
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,560
We call those who have lost their spouses by death...

871
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,640
"widow" or "widower".

872
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,560
And kids who have lost their parents are called orphans.

873
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,960
But...

874
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,840
do you know...

875
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,720
what parents who have lost their children are called?

876
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,560
There's no word.

877
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,120
It's so cruel...

878
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,440
that there's no word for it.

879
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,560
So?

880
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,080
Is that why you were planning on kidnapping his son?

881
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,920
You were going to use a child's life to avenge your son's death?

882
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,480
That boy will be fine.

883
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,800
I'm a father, not a monster.

884
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,800
The bomb won't go off.

885
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,440
This is fake.

886
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,920
I was just trying to lure Woo Byung Sik,

887
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,080
that's all.

888
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,680
He'll be fine?

889
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,720
Gosh, please...

890
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,800
Why are you doing this to me? Why...

891
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,960
Yes.

892
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,600
So...

893
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,080
So, please... Please.

894
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,440
Give me some time, please.

895
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,960
I must make that jerk, Woo Byung Sik,

896
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,440
reveal himself...

897
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,720
in front of the public.

898
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,680
What? Are you saying you'll broadcast the whole thing or what?

899
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,080
That's right.

900
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,360
I'll broadcast it live online.

901
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,520
I can't trust broadcasting companies.

902
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,920
I'll make sure everyone in the country...

903
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,720
sees Woo Byung Sik through the live broadcast.

904
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,080
Who do you think will try to kill Seung Chul's dad?

905
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,880
Do you think that Woo Byung Sik...

906
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,240
will let you do that even if he shows up?

907
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,520
What if you end up getting killed?

908
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,520
That's precisely what I want.

909
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,640
Gosh, please...

910
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,400
Please... Please...

911
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,000
Kill me.

912
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,000
If you don't kill me,

913
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,480
your son will die.

914
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,800
I'll kill him.

915
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,280
No, don't!

916
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,240
Only then...

917
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,520
Only then, my plan will come to completion.

918
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,840
So...

919
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,880
So please...

920
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,440
Don't get in my way.

921
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,880
Please. I implore you.

922
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,040
Don't get in my way, please.

923
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,640
Please.

924
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,560
I beg you.

925
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,240
I'm sorry.

926
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,160
If you persuade Woo Byung Sik to turn himself in,

927
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,120
Mr. Park will no longer need to go on with this hostage situation.

928
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,200
So please tell him to turn himself in.

929
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,920
Is hiding your husband from the police...

930
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,040
more important than your son's life?

931
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,080
He's not picking up. He's not answering.

932
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,960
Is it ringing?

933
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,600
Give me his number. I'll try to track his location.

934
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,440
What?

935
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,400
What's going on?

936
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,440
What is it?

937
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,280
His name is the number one trending search term at the moment.

938
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,280
What?

939
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,560
Hang on.

940
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,280
- All people of Korea. - Look at this.

941
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,440
Please have a good look at this picture.

942
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,760
This man is Woo Byung Sik.

943
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,160
Woo Byung Sik, the main culprit of the Time Mart collapse disaster,

944
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,680
whom the media reported to have been found dead...

945
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,840
in a burnt car,

946
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,240
has actually been alive for the last 20 years.

947
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,560
And in a few minutes...

948
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,640
at 8pm sharp,

949
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,560
Woo Byung Sik...

950
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,760
will appear before your eyes.

951
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,200
Woo Byung Sik.

952
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,120
If you want your son to live,

953
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,160
you better get yourself here quickly.

954
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,600
He's alive?

955
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,320
How shameless. I can't believe he's alive.

956
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,760
Isn't that man really Woo Byung Sik?

957
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,160
- Who is he? - He's alive?

958
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,080
That can't be. He's probably just his look-alike.

959
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,760
No! He's obviously alive.

960
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,480
- He must really be alive. - What's that man doing though?

961
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,880
There's a pattern on the face of the watch.

962
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,520
I've never seen it.

963
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:11,080
Then have you heard anything about the owner of Pumpkin Singer?

964
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,680
Who? Clara?

965
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,720
Gosh, don't even talk about her in front of me.

966
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,440
She got out alone when the rest of us got raided by the police.

967
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,040
I'm sure she's doing fine wherever she is.

968
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,160
What are you doing now?

969
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,360
There's big news.

970
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,920
- What news? - Mr. Park, a father of one...

971
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,040
of Time Mart Collapse victims,

972
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,200
is insisting that Woo Byung Sik, the main culprit of the collapse...

973
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,480
and the former CEO of the construction company,

974
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,560
is actually alive in his online broadcast at the moment...

975
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,440
That jerk, Woo Byung Sik, is really alive?

976
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,120
- Wasn't he found burnt and dead? - In the picture he disclosed,

977
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,600
there is a man who is speculated to be Woo Byung Sik.

978
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,960
He completely fooled everyone in this country.

979
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,840
He's also insisting he's holding Woo Byung Sik's son hostage now.

980
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,840
- Hang on. - If he doesn't come until 8pm...

981
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,360
You should catch him and ask him where Clara is.

982
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,640
- Pardon me? - That jerk...

983
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,040
used to be a regular at Pumpkin Singer.

984
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,120
He had so many clients to entertain.

985
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,280
He used to go there all the time...

986
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,680
and had many private conversations with Clara.

987
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,200
- You mean Woo Byung Sik? - Yes.

988
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,120
Gosh, I totally knew that his building would collapse.

989
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,120
He spent all of his money on entertaining his clients.

990
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,399
I bet he bought the cheapest construction materials.

991
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,399
It's so obvious.

992
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,120
I'm pretty sure Clara made a hefty amount through him.

993
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,720
If that's the case,

994
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,200
could Woo Byung Sik be this jerk?

995
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,359
Try to remember.

996
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,680
Did you see anything else other than the shadow?

997
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,120
I'm not sure.

998
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,600
- Calm down. Try to stay calm. - Woo Byung Sik.

999
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,680
If you don't show up on time, your son...

1000
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,240
will die just like how my son died.

1001
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,040
- "Just like how my son died"? - Just remember that.

1002
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,080
Could he be at Moojin Time Mart?

1003
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,760
(April 16, 1997, We will remember the day forever.)

1004
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,760
(The Largest Shopping Complex in Asia)

1005
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,560
Do you really think he's here?

1006
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,920
- Call Moojin Police Station now. - Yes, sir.

1007
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,279
Gosh, why do I have to take a leak again?

1008
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,720
There was construction going on where Time Mart used to be,

1009
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,319
but it's been put on pause as the victims' families object. Look.

1010
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,000
They're not there.

1011
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,960
They're not here. This isn't the place.

1012
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,880
(The Largest Shopping Complex in Asia)

1013
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,760
What? What do you mean?

1014
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,480
You see these buildings at the back, right?

1015
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,320
But I saw a large road outside the window of the building.

1016
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,560
It was lined with street lights,

1017
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,040
but strangely, only one direction of the road was completely empty.

1018
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,440
What?

1019
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,000
Only one direction was completely empty?

1020
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,960
The police must've been controlling traffic going that way. Hold on.

1021
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,480
- I think it's Seoun, not Moojin. - Sorry?

1022
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,960
There's a night marathon happening in Geumpyung-gu,

1023
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,640
and they've blocked one side of the road for it.

1024
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:38,960
Look at this.

1025
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,920
Let's go there, then.

1026
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,240
Woo Byung Sik is alive? My foot.

1027
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,720
People in this country love conspiracy theories.

1028
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,640
He got compensated. What's he doing now?

1029
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,920
I'm so sick of it. Until when will he try to make money off of it?

1030
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,440
- He's a total psycho. - He's a psycho.

1031
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,320
- What a waste of time. - The top floor.

1032
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,800
- Where? - Nice, it's like a game!

1033
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,240
Woo Byung Sik.

1034
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,640
Woo Byung Sik!

1035
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,360
Woo Byung Sik.

1036
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,120
Get yourself here immediately!

1037
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,000
If you don't show up soon,

1038
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,080
I'll really kill your son.

1039
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,280
I'm really going to kill him!

1040
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,360
Please.

1041
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,080
If you don't come soon,

1042
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,640
your son will die.

1043
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:57,120
I said, I'm really going to kill him!

1044
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,000
Yes, this is the place. They must be here.

1045
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,920
Oh, no. It's already 8pm.

1046
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,640
Mr. Park will die at 8:20pm,

1047
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,360
but Steven will die before that.

1048
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,480
Then let's go that way first.

1049
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,640
- Okay. - Let's go.

1050
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,400
Oh, over there. They're over there.

1051
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,480
Woo Byung Sik, you better be watching this.

1052
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,560
If you don't show up immediately,

1053
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,680
I...

1054
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,600
will really kill your son.

1055
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,760
I'll really kill him!

1056
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,840
No!

1057
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,560
Hey, Ha Ram.

1058
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,320
Are you okay?

1059
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,200
Did you get hurt?

1060
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,920
Do you have any injuries?

1061
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,400
Steven... Steven...

1062
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,440
Steven. Steven.

1063
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,120
Ha Ram.

1064
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,520
What...

1065
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,080
Gosh.

1066
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,120
I never even set up a bomb. This can't be.

1067
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,720
Steven...

1068
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,720
Steven.

1069
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,840
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1070
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,800
I came too late. I'm sorry.

1071
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,120
Please...

1072
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,480
Please don't kill me. Please don't...

1073
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,840
There has been a bomb explosion at a redevelopment site.

1074
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,320
Residents in the vicinity are evacuating the area at the moment.

1075
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,520
I have some information for you.

1076
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,320
The man who just detonated the bomb...

1077
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,680
purchased another bomb from me.

1078
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,320
He bought one that's a lot stronger than the one that just went off.

1079
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,680
He bought one that's a lot stronger than the one that just went off.

1080
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,920
What?

1081
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,640
Honey...

1082
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,560
Honey!

1083
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,040
You filthy jerk.

1084
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,960
Then...

1085
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,440
was that you?

1086
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,560
Was that you?

1087
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,280
All agents,

1088
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,840
kill him immediately if he shows any signs of setting off a bomb.

1089
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,560
No!

1090
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,600
The culprit of the kidnap and bombing incident, Park Soon Nam,

1091
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,600
had lost his son...

1092
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,800
20 years ago because of the collapse of Moojin Time Mart.

1093
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,560
And after he became distant with his wife,

1094
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,560
it seems highly possible that his rage made him become delusional.

1095
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,680
His wife suddenly disappeared after she received a large sum...

1096
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,840
of settlement money from the construction company 20 years ago.

1097
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,680
After that, he is known to have had disputes with other victim families.

1098
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,880
- The photo of Woo Byung Sik... - Mr. Park has been living alone...

1099
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,800
- is nowhere to be found. - ever since his wife left home.

1100
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,880
- They say the photo was actually... - It turns out that he had been...

1101
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:19,240
- a photoshopped photo. - suffering from depression...

1102
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,200
Here.

1103
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,360
Honey.

1104
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,800
I'm sorry.

1105
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,880
I failed like a fool.

1106
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,720
I even...

1107
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,200
I even killed you.

1108
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,000
It's okay.

1109
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,200
At least we never gave up.

1110
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,480
Thank you, honey.

1111
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,800
Let's...

1112
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,680
go see Seung Chul now.

1113
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,680
I'm sure he'll be waiting for us.

1114
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:13,320
Photos of Woo Byung Sik are falling from the sky.

1115
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,840
- Hundreds of photos... - The photos turned out to be real.

1116
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,320
- of Woo Byung Sik fell from... - Therefore, he has instantly...

1117
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,880
become a wanted man.

1118
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,400
Interpol...

1119
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,640
will also search for him as well.

1120
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,200
If Woo Byung Sik gets caught, he'll be charged with...

1121
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,880
- It's Woo Byung Sik. - My gosh, he was still alive.

1122
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,120
Hey, you're here.

1123
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,400
Where's my wife and Steven?

1124
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,400
They're waiting for you on the boat.

1125
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:37,520
Okay, thank you. Thank you for taking care of everything.

1126
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,000
How could you...

1127
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,600
(Black)

1128
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,320
Why do I keep making mistakes about the moment of their deaths?

1129
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,120
I never trust humans.

1130
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,200
Where's Woo Byung Sik?

1131
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:02,000
I don't know who released all those photos, but I'm very grateful.

1132
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,560
You shouldn't trust anyone either.

1133
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,680
You should be careful of Oh Man Soo.

1134
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,840
Yes. It'll be fine as long as I keep quiet.

1135
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,560
I'll die as you wish.

1136
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,200
You're going to die?

1137
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,120
You won't have it your way.
