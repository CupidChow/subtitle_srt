1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
(Episode 17)

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,240
You aren't Kim Joon?

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,080
His face is damaged badly because of the car wheel that ran over.

4
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,440
They're unable to recognize the dead's face.

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,520
He damaged the face intentionally...

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,720
to make it look like it's Kim Joon's body.

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,160
But why would Kim Young Seok do that?

8
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,880
This means somebody else swapped the corpses without anyone knowing.

9
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,600
Like it was Kim Joon's.

10
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Goodness.

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,480
Where is Kim Joon then?

12
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,080
Whose ashes is it in Kim Joon's burial urn?

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,600
This is mysterious like Detective Conan.

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,320
Go after it quickly.

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,960
Why should I?

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,520
I have nothing to do with Kim Joon's corpse.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Forget about it.

18
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,320
Kim Young Seok is caught. so Kang Ha Ram's safe now.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,640
I just have to leave here now.

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,360
What if...

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,680
Kim Joon is alive?

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,920
What if Kim Joon's body is elsewhere by someone like what you just said?

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,560
It must be someone...

24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,160
who wants to protect Kim Joon from Kim Young Seok.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,720
How could he not show up for 20 years if he's still alive?

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,960
He could have lost his memory.

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,600
You watched too many movies.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,759
You're the result of watching too many horrible movies.

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,120
Really?

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,680
Could he really be alive?

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,720
He was someone...

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,600
who made my life go on like a pillar of hope for me.

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,960
If Kim Joon is really alive...

34
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,200
If I find Kim Joon for Ha Ram, she will be happy without me...

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,320
even when I leave her.

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,760
Yes.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,960
I should look for Kim Joon.

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,640
What? But how will you find him?

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,040
If you can't believe me, why don't you ask Kang Soo Hyuk?

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,480
He was obsessed with finding the murderer of your brother.

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,920
Kang Soo Hyuk investigated Kim Joon's case.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,560
There must be some clues.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,400
What is this?

44
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,720
The detective in charge wasn't Kang Soo Hyuk.

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,040
Yes, I was in charge of this case.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,440
Has Soo Hyuk asked anything about this case?

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,880
Kang Soo Hyuk was looking at this photo for a while...

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
and took the phone number of the dead boy's parents.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,680
He did?

50
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Well, the detectives did come and see me...

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,640
to ask about Moo Chan.

52
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,880
Did the detective ask if Kim Joon... No.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,720
I mean, Moo Chan...

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,600
had any particular characteristics of his body?

55
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,120
"Particular characteristics of his body..."

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,040
Well, I can't remember that.

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,160
But why...

58
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,880
Why didn't you do an autopsy on his dead body?

59
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,800
His face and body...

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,240
were damaged horribly by the car wheel.

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,440
I didn't want to damage his body anymore.

62
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,600
But was Kim Yeong Seok really the culprit...

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,680
who killed Moo Chan?

64
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,640
I don't know yet.

65
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,480
If Kang Soo Hyuk went to see Han Moo Gang's mother,

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,400
he must have known that the corpses were swapped.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,560
Then did he find out what happened to Kim Joon before he died?

68
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,920
Ha Ram.

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Maybe Kim Joon is still alive.

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,040
Hold on a second. I'll find Kim Joon for you.

71
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,440
Even when he came to my house with Ha Ram,

72
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
and when Ha Ram told me that he was going to die,

73
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
I just left him to die.

74
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,680
What are you doing here?

75
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,480
Why are you here?

76
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,400
When was it that Kang Soo Hyuk brought Ha Ram home?

77
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,680
Get lost. Get out of my sight.

78
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,120
I will get lost.

79
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,600
But if you want me to stay away from Ha Ram any sooner,

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,320
you should cooperate with me.

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,200
Well,

82
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,560
it was after a few days since Moojin Time Mart's collapse.

83
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,280
Ha Ram's father passed away...

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,320
after four days since he left Ha Ram with me.

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,680
It must be the night of the 20th.

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,000
Has he told you anything?

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,240
Did he say anything strange?

88
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Well.

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,680
He's usually calm in any given situation,

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,680
but he seemed anxious that day.

91
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,600
He also seemed nervous.

92
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,840
Honey.

93
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,920
Dad. Don't die.

94
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,080
What's going on?

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,960
Honey.

96
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,880
My greed...

97
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,560
has made you unfortunate.

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,320
Please take good care of Ha Ram.

100
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,040
Has something happened to you?

101
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
Let me go. Let go of me.

102
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
You can't, Ha Ram.

103
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,040
Let go of me. I have to go see dad.

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,880
I have to check if the shadow is gone from dad.

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
"The shadow"?

106
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, there was a shadow on dad.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,120
Dad is going to die!

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,280
I went down to Moojin to see if he's okay because of what she said.

109
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,720
The police said that he'd be at the Time Mart collapse site...

110
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
or in a hospital.

111
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,040
I was looking for him and saw him at the hospital.

112
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,440
He was talking about something serious with a doctor.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,280
I then realized that I wasn't too late.

114
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,960
It was a relief to know he's still alive.

115
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,480
Then something hit me.

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
Do you happen to...

117
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,440
I thought that it would be better to have him dead...

118
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
for Ha Ram.

119
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,159
I got a call. Bye.

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,880
To raise Ha Ram and give her a normal life like others,

121
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,160
I thought it would be better for Ha Ram to grow up without him,

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
so I chose to just come back.

123
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Then a few days later, I got a call.

124
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
He died from falling off a construction site.

125
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,880
So it was the night of the 20th when he left Ha Ram to you,

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,680
and he died four days after that.

127
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,880
After four days of investigation,

128
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,760
He came to see the doctor because he knew the bodies were swapped.

129
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,120
Do you remember who the doctor is?

130
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,039
I only saw him from behind.

131
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,280
Don't you have anything that Kang Soo Hyuk possessed?

132
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,160
Like his investigation notes?

133
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,720
I burned all his possessions.

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,840
The only things left were recently taken by Ha Ram.

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
Kang Soo Hyuk.

136
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,840
When was this...

137
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,360
What is this?

138
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,360
It must be when Ha Ram was young.

139
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,080
She's pretty since birth.

140
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,840
(Seoul 20N5902)

141
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Seoul.

142
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
This car was reported to be lost 20 years ago.

143
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,880
Let me see. The date when this was reported...

144
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
is April 20, 1997.

145
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,400
It was April 20?

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,600
What? It's the day Kim Joon's accident happened.

147
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,960
Who owns the car?

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,440
The owner is...

149
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,720
(Min Jae Hoon)

150
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,800
Have you reported the loss of your car 20 years ago?

151
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
My car?

152
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,520
Yes, I think so. Why are you asking?

153
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,320
How was your car lost?

154
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,480
Well,

155
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,640
it was when Moojin Time Mart was collapsed.

156
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,120
I stayed up a few nights.

157
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,400
When I went to the parking lot, I realized that my car was missing.

158
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,360
I reported to the police right away but couldn't find it in the end.

159
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,600
Why are you asking about this car?

160
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
So you reported this on April 20,

161
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,160
but since you stayed up a few nights at the hospital,

162
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,440
you don't know exactly when your car got lost. Is that right?

163
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
- Yes. - Turn it over.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,640
Have you met this detective before?

165
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,720
I can't remember faces from 20 years ago.

166
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,400
A detective did come and see me.

167
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,920
But I'm not sure if he's the one.

168
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,320
The detective just asked when and how I lost my car.

169
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
Okay.

170
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,680
Do you remember if there were any missing corpses back then?

171
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,480
Well,

172
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,920
it was the corpse of a boy whose left wrist got cut off.

173
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,360
He also had blue birthmarks on his bottoms.

174
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm not sure.

175
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,560
I never heard anything about any missing corpses.

176
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,720
Why are you asking all this, Han Moo Gang?

177
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,960
I see.

178
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,840
If I can only prove...

179
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,040
that the doctor has lied about his menthol allergy,

180
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,640
Mr. Oh's mother won't die.

181
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,520
I saved someone from committing suicide because of his depression.

182
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,000
He was the pilot in that airplane.

183
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,920
He caused the accident to kill himself.

184
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,560
I shouldn't do this anymore.

185
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,120
What? Why is she just leaving?

186
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,200
What's gotten into her?

187
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,440
Are you really the son of Kim Young Seok?

188
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,880
Did you know about his crimes?

189
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,600
We'll explain everything later.

190
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,720
- Please say something! - Hurry over here!

191
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,840
- Please look over here! - Wait!

192
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,160
- Please tell us the truth! - Did you know about his crimes?

193
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,840
- Please have an interview with us! - Please look over here!

194
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,160
Get in.

195
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,960
Leo, I'll go up there and settle things down, okay?

196
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
- Okay. - Also, reporters might rush here,

197
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,240
so keep the door locked.

198
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Okay.

199
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,600
Until now, I thought Kim Young Seok killed Soo Hyuk...

200
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,480
because Soo Hyuk was investigating his hit and run on Joon.

201
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
But if Kim Young Seok really caused that accident,

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,960
he had no reason to switch the corpses.

203
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,480
It seems like the one who stole this car took Joon's body.

204
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,080
Who could it be?

205
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,480
What? Can he see me? Is that 444?

206
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,960
What?

207
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,800
You... You're Jae Su Dong.

208
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,120
That little...

209
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,160
Stop!

210
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,000
My goodness.

211
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,240
Stop right there!

212
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,200
Stop, you punk!

213
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,240
Hey!

214
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,800
That's right.

215
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,760
I need to teleport. Teleport.

216
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
What's the problem?

217
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Do you know how much trouble I went through because of you?

218
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,760
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
Whose body have you been using?

220
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,240
That's...

221
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,280
Don't try to play tricks.

222
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,400
There isn't much time left.

223
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,640
When I saw the news,

224
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,880
I stabbed my own eyes. I couldn't bear what happened.

225
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
No.

226
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,840
I shouldn't save any more people.

227
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,440
Kyung Soo.

228
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,640
I'm sorry that this is the best thing...

229
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,880
I can do after all.

230
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,920
I wanted to work hard...

231
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,800
and reveal the truth for you,

232
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,360
but I guess this is it.

233
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,760
I wanted to make you proud.

234
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,520
I'm so sorry.

235
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,640
Also, Man Soo.

236
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,840
My dear son, Man Soo.

237
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,480
Because I was too poor,

238
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,520
I thought you'd be happy if I sent you to your rich dad.

239
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,600
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
I made you unhappy...

241
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,040
(My son didn't kill himself because of depression.)

242
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,120
Mom, mom!

243
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,359
You haven't changed at all.

244
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,319
Do you think Kyung Soo would be grateful if you die like this?

245
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,400
Do you think they'll reinvestigate his case if you do this?

246
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,640
Please. Please!

247
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,960
He must be my brother Mom always talked to me about.

248
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,120
Mom!

249
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,400
- Mom, please! - It's good to see him like this.

250
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
Brother.

251
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,320
- No. Please wake up. - Hang in there just a bit more.

252
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,000
- Open your eyes. - Ma'am.

253
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,120
- Please wake up. - Mom!

254
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,840
What are you doing?

255
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,080
Come on out.

256
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,880
You too.

257
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,280
Get out of there now.

258
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,000
What are you doing?

259
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,000
What are you doing? Are you taking a dump?

260
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
Get out of there.

261
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,560
I can't.

262
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,720
I can't get out.

263
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,840
What? What are you talking about?

264
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,840
Hey, stop joking. Get out of there now.

265
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,000
I can't get out.

266
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,280
Why can't I get out?

267
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,640
What's going on?

268
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,600
It's the same thing that happened to Black.

269
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
There is no choice.

270
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
I should call Death Squad and have them get him out.

271
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,480
What?

272
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,240
Don't call Death Squad.

273
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,400
Please don't.

274
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
Why on earth can't I get out of this body?

275
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,600
But who attacked Moo Gang again?

276
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,560
Senator Nam came and asked me to give the police...

277
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,200
a false statement, so I did.

278
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,040
He said if I don't,

279
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,080
he'd talk to Mr. Oh Man Ho and have me fired...

280
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,920
from the hospital.

281
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,480
I had no choice either.

282
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,560
(The evidence of Senator Nam's son's sexual harassment in the army)

283
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,680
- How is your mom? - She just fell asleep.

284
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,080
She promised me that she will never do something like this again.

285
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,920
By the way, you posted this...

286
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,200
on the internet, right?

287
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Right?

288
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,280
Who do you think I am?

289
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I can even hack into the Blue House's network if I want to.

290
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,680
I was so worried...

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,160
that you might not do anything about it.

292
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,200
That soldier Detective Han caught before.

293
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,040
It looks like you also posted that video as evidence as well.

294
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm so relieved...

295
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,200
that he's also cleared of the false charge.

296
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,960
Me too.

297
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Hi, Detective Han.

298
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,760
What?

299
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,160
An accident?

300
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,920
Darn it.

301
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,040
That loser saw me inside Moo Gang's body. He'll hide himself better now.

302
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,880
Why can't I get out of this body?

303
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,760
I found it out.

304
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,280
I found out why you can't get out of that body.

305
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
What is it?

306
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,040
Apparently, you can't get out of your own body.

307
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
What?

308
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Your body remembers your soul,

309
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,760
so your body holds on to your soul and doesn't let it go.

310
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
My own body?

311
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Yes. A grim reaper went into his own body for a while,

312
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
and he showed the same symptoms as you.

313
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,760
He couldn't get out of that body, so Death Squad came in the end.

314
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,600
They took him inside his body as it is,

315
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,520
and I eavesdropped on their conversation.

316
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,200
Do you think I'm Han Moo Gang?

317
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,400
This is his body.

318
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,360
I know that.

319
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,080
That's not the reason I need, okay?

320
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,320
Find out the reason why I can't get out of this body.

321
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,320
The true reason why I, 444, can't get out of Moo Gang's body.

322
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,880
"444 can't get out of Moo Gang's body"?

323
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,240
Then that means...

324
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,480
Doctor...

325
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,120
Is Detective Han okay?

326
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,120
Yes, he had a minor concussion. He'll wake up soon. Goodbye then.

327
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Okay.

328
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,680
Why is he going to die?

329
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,320
Moo Gang said people with a shadow inside of their bodies die faster.

330
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,320
What?

331
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,440
Gosh, you startled me.

332
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,960
Are you okay? You're not badly hurt, are you?

333
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,680
Did you say that doctor had a shadow inside of his body?

334
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,280
Is that why...

335
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,240
444 is prying into...

336
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,960
what happened to Kang Soo Hyuk 20 years ago?

337
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,480
Because he sensed something?

338
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,400
Get out of there, Loser.

339
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
Darn it. I finally caught you.

340
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,960
Get out of there.

341
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,360
- Get out of there. - Wait...

342
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,400
Get out of there now!

343
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,040
You don't want to?

344
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,720
Fine.

345
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,440
I'll make a hole in that head and drag you out myself.

346
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,640
One.

347
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,200
Two.

348
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,200
Who are you?

349
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,840
"At the end of the Joseon era, she killed her husband and herself..."

350
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,560
"as she became unable to bear his violence."

351
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
"She disappeared during her soul collection duty."

352
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,400
"And she hasn't been found or seen for 100 years."

353
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,160
"She's careful and meticulous enough..."

354
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,360
"to leave no clue behind."

355
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,040
"She disappeared..."

356
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,400
"she was on duty at the March 1st Movement."

357
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,240
It means she's hiding inside of a dead body.

358
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,120
I feel terrible for that old lady, Kim Yi Bbeun Yi.

359
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,480
She ended up killing herself because she was mistreated by her husband.

360
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,760
I hope she just never gets caught.

361
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
Please be happy.

362
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,560
Why are you suddenly pitying a mere human?

363
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,640
But I wonder how she managed to run away for 100 years.

364
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,160
It's such a misery.

365
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
It's mystery, not misery.

366
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,160
Are you...

367
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,080
that grim reaper who has been on the run for 100 years?

368
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,320
Yes, that's me.

369
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,440
Death Squad captures 99 percent of the runaway grim reapers,

370
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,760
but they haven't captured me yet.

371
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,360
I'm their lost one percent, Kim Yi Bbeun Yi.

372
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,480
What then?

373
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,480
Was it you who ran over me earlier?

374
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,400
You and that loser work together, don't you?

375
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,080
Ms. 100-year Grim Reaper.

376
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,440
Detective Han was 444. We have to run away now!

377
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,920
Don't worry.

378
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,520
If 444 comes out of this body now, he'll lose his memory.

379
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,960
He wouldn't remember seeing you either.

380
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,240
Lose his memory?

381
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,600
When you come out of a body when the body dies once again,

382
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,400
you lose the memory of when you were inside of that body.

383
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,040
What? He clearly died. Why wouldn't 444 come out?

384
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,480
Does that mean...

385
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,000
444 is...

386
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,120
Are you laughing right now?

387
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,120
I can't believe this old woman.

388
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,040
Where is that loser? Tell me.

389
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,200
I promised him that I wouldn't reveal that.

390
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,320
What?

391
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,440
All right. This is like riding a cow when I can't get a horse.

392
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,880
That loser is nothing compared to you.

393
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,440
You're the grim reaper who has been on the run for 100 years.

394
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,720
Maybe I'll be rewarded for capturing you.

395
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
- Fine. Let's go. - Wait a second.

396
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,680
I'll tell you what you want to know.

397
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,040
What? Don't get smart with me, you hag.

398
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Come with me.

399
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,000
The reason why Kang Soo Hyuk came to Min Jae Hoon 20 years ago.

400
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
What?

401
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,800
A corpse.

402
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,040
He asked Min Jae Hoon about a switched corpse.

403
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,280
A corpse?

404
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,600
Yes. I'm looking for the corpse of a student I collected at the scene.

405
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,840
I can't seem to find it.

406
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,440
How was the condition of the body?

407
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,040
When I collected it,

408
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,600
his left wrist had been cut off.

409
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,040
I'm not sure.

410
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,280
Since it was a collapse, there were many bodies with severed body parts.

411
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,720
I'm being called. Excuse me.

412
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,640
That detective...

413
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,160
definitely knew that Min Jae Hoon had stolen a corpse.

414
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,000
Are you saying...

415
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,480
Min Jae Hoon is the one who switched Kim Joon's body?

416
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,280
Min Jae Hoon was quite distressed by it then.

417
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,320
Why did I have to come into a terminal patient's body?

418
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,760
Where should I find a new body this time?

419
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,360
What's so agonizing?

420
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,640
If it's that agonizing, I'll make you feel better.

421
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,680
Can I have your great looks and abilities?

422
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,280
Goodness, you old witch.

423
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,560
So you've managed to run away for 100 years...

424
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,840
by murdering humans?

425
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,280
What else can I do?

426
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,920
The ones who are destined to die...

427
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,520
are followed by grim reapers. I can't get into their bodies.

428
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,560
I had no choice but to kill someone myself.

429
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Don't you know what happens if you kill humans?

430
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,760
You will cease to exist! That's the maximum penalty!

431
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,200
That's not the maximum penalty.

432
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,800
What?

433
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,600
Why did Detective Han have to be 444? Why?

434
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,040
Darn it, I'm such a loser.

435
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,200
Hold on.

436
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,200
Min Jae Hoon switched Kim Joon's body with another body,

437
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,320
but you killed Min Jae Hoon.

438
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,640
That means it's not certain if Kim Joon is alive or dead...

439
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,200
You darn hag...

440
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,680
Are you laughing? How can you be laughing right now?

441
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,520
Forget it. Let's go.

442
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,600
Wait.

443
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,560
I know...

444
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,600
where Kim Joon's real body is.

445
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,320
Stop lying. Just come with me.

446
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,840
But it's true.

447
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,400
I'll tell you everything. I also have evidence of it.

448
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,120
Please let me go.

449
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,280
If you let me go,

450
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,920
I'll tell you where Kim Joon is.

451
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,760
Do you really know...

452
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,400
where Kim Joon is?

453
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,600
I've told you everything I know.

454
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,040
The evidence is in that laptop.

455
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,760
If you reveal my dad's tape,

456
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,080
all of you won't be safe either.

457
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,520
How could they do such a terrible thing to a child?

458
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,400
Humans are unbelievable indeed.

459
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,320
How terrible and disgusting.

460
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,600
Ha Ram will get shocked if she finds out how Kim Joon died.

461
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Wait.

462
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,840
There might be something at Moojin Hospital.

463
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,200
(Moojin Hospital)

464
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,360
(Moojin Hospital)

465
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,120
(Moojin Hospital)

466
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,400
(Moojin Health Center)

467
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,120
(Warning! Do not enter! Facility shut down in 1995.)

468
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,680
(Warning! Do not enter! Facility shut down in 1995.)

469
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,920
I can't do it.

470
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,800
If we don't do it now, it'll be too late. He'll die.

471
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,680
Then leave. I'll do it myself.

472
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,760
Is this me?

473
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,800
Is this really me?

474
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,080
Is this me?

475
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,280
Moo Gang, say hello.

476
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,920
I told you about him, didn't I?

477
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,600
He's your brother.

478
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,120
Why is he sick?

479
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,160
Well, he has a weak heart.

480
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,800
I told you not to run. This is what happens if you don't listen to me.

481
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,640
Can't he get cured by getting surgery?

482
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,760
The thing is, Moo Gang's blood type is Rh negative.

483
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
So it's hard to find a donor.

484
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,400
He's been on the waiting list.

485
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,240
But I don't know when it'll be his turn.

486
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,360
What?

487
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm also an Rh negative. I found out when I did a blood test at school.

488
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,400
My goodness. Really?

489
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,480
Anyway, he's your younger brother now.

490
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,840
So I hope you get along with Moo Gang from now on.

491
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,040
- Okay. - Good.

492
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,480
Hi, my name's Kim Joon.

493
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
My name's Moo Gang.

494
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,320
You guys, look over here.

495
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,280
Put your arms on your shoulders.

496
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,880
Look over here.

497
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,440
A time capsule?

498
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,360
Yes. I buried it with a friend of mine.

499
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,600
This is so childish.

500
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,840
You should bury it again.

501
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,040
I have to dig it up with my friend later on.

502
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,200
But why is our school so quiet?

503
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,760
It's not even a holiday today.

504
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,120
Okay, Mom.

505
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,760
She can't come home again because there are a lot of patients.

506
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,320
We've been in this hotel for days. This is so boring.

507
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,280
We've only been eating take-out food.

508
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,960
Are you going to give it to the girl you like?

509
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,800
Yes.

510
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,080
Sun Young.

511
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,920
Sun Young.

512
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,640
I'm all done.

513
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,920
A written card is too lame.

514
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
I should leave her a video message.

515
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,280
Is this tape empty?

516
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,560
Sun Young, happy birthday.

517
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,520
I got you An Chi Hwan's fourth album.

518
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,680
It's not just any CD.

519
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,120
Look here. I even got you his autograph.

520
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,960
I also got you concert tickets.

521
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,320
I heard he's going to hold a concert in Moojin,

522
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,400
so I spent all night to buy these.

523
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
Sun Young.

524
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,160
I missed you so much during the year I was apart from you.

525
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,720
You know I like you, right?

526
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,880
Happy birthday.

527
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,080
Ma'am.

528
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Ma'am.

529
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,440
Where's Sun Young?

530
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,680
My goodness, I heard Clara...

531
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,520
has dragged Sun Young by her hair and took her somewhere.

532
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,720
My gosh, she's so aggressive.

533
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,160
What could she have done wrong?

534
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,480
Where did she take her?

535
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,320
Over there.

536
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,040
He said he'll be back soon. Why isn't he back yet?

537
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,680
He said it was in this neighborhood.

538
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,800
Hey, Moo Chan.

539
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,440
Moo Chan.

540
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,080
Sun Young.

541
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,920
Is she over there?

542
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,360
Moo Chan!

543
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,120
Moo Chan!

544
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,080
You hid it somewhere, didn't you? It was you, wasn't it?

545
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,920
What's going on here?

546
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,680
Where is it?

547
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,880
Moo Chan.

548
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,160
How did you find me here?

549
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,760
- I kept calling you. - Be quiet.

550
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,600
- Talk quietly. - I just followed you here.

551
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,080
Where's the videotape?

552
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,280
Where is it? Where's the videotape?

553
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,160
Tell me!

554
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,520
Tell me!

555
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,720
Please stop.

556
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Don't hit her! Don't hit Sun Young!

557
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,760
Who are you? Who are you to get involved?

558
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,480
- Stop hitting her! - Who in the world are you?

559
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
- You little jerk. - Joon!

560
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,960
Moo Gang, no!

561
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,520
Moo Gang.

562
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,240
Moo Chan.

563
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Moo Gang! Moo Gang!

564
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,120
Clara. Clara!

565
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,000
I think I killed that lady.

566
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,600
No, I'm sure she's not dead.

567
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,280
Then I want to go check.

568
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,600
I want you to hide over there. I'll go check.

569
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,720
Clara?

570
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,720
Give me the videotape!

571
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,760
Stay here, and stand guard.

572
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,080
Let's go together.

573
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,320
Just stay here, and keep an eye out.

574
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,160
- You wench. - What are you talking about?

575
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,200
Don't lie to me, and just give me the videotape.

576
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,680
Give it to me before I slit your throat.

577
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,000
Do it.

578
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,320
Do it!

579
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,040
Go ahead.

580
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,920
You little...

581
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,240
You jerk!

582
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,520
(Inflammable)

583
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,000
Joon.

584
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,560
Who are you?

585
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,120
Jin Sook, we need to run away! Hurry up, and run!

586
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,400
You brat.

587
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,520
Where's the videotape?

588
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,880
It's over here!

589
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Joon. Joon!

590
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,080
What happened? Did she die?

591
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,160
No.

592
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,880
Really?

593
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,400
Give it to me! Where is it?

594
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Give me the tape!

595
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,520
Who's that man?

596
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,840
I'm scared.

597
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,120
I'll lure him, so I want you to go that way.

598
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,400
If you go straight that way, you'll find a road.

599
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,320
Ask the first person you see to call the police, okay?

600
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,240
Stop right there!

601
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,520
Where... Where's Sun Young?

602
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,640
She went back into the mountains to look for you.

603
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,840
Didn't you see her?

604
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,640
Use this yellow pen...

605
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,080
when someone's trying to harm you.

606
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Somebody, please help me.

607
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,360
There you are.

608
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,240
Give it to me, you punk.

609
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,160
Give it to me!

610
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,600
Wang Young Choon, you jerk. What do you think you're doing?

611
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,760
My gosh.

612
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,120
Are you okay?

613
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,760
What happened?

614
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,320
Why did that guy try to...

615
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,400
Mr. Kang.

616
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,800
Mr. Kang.

617
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,080
Joon!

618
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,560
Joon!

619
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,480
Who in the world was that?

620
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,240
Sir. Sir.

621
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,520
Help...

622
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,120
Are you okay?

623
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,360
Mom... Mom...

624
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,640
My head hurts so much.

625
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,920
My head is burning.

626
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,760
Joon!

627
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,040
Joon!

628
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,960
Joon, are you okay? Come here.

629
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,400
Come here. It's okay. You'll be fine.

630
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,800
Get out of Han Moo Gang's body.

631
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,480
Get out.

632
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,440
Get out!

633
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,600
Get out!

634
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,320
Stop it!

635
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,680
No!

636
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,320
We need to leave now.

637
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,560
We need to leave right now. We need to go.

638
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,480
Hurry.

639
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,240
Let's go.

640
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,320
You will forget everything now.

641
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,040
Is your memory back?

642
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
Yes.

643
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,160
I'm the Grim Reaper who took your soul.

644
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,280
Now that you know where your body is,

645
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,960
let the people know.

646
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,320
Have them rescue your body.

647
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,960
Once the body is found,

648
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,720
you will return to your own self.

649
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,160
That way, you can go to paradise.

650
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,600
Will he be okay?

651
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,600
He seems quite shocked.

652
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,360
He'll accept everything in the end.

653
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,040
Moo Gang, what's wrong? Did something happen to you?

654
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,280
Why did you do it?

655
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,840
How could you kill him?

656
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,920
What are you talking about?

657
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,280
Kim Joon.

658
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,600
You killed him.

659
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,320
What... What do you mean?

660
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,560
(Notice of Organ Donations)

661
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,480
How...

662
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,640
- Why did you do it? - How...

663
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,920
Why did you do it?

664
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,440
Why did you kill him?

665
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,800
I did it...

666
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,960
for you.

667
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,080
At that time,

668
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,680
I didn't have a choice.

669
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,720
Who could have shot him?

670
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,600
Moo Chan, wake up.

671
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,120
We're almost at the hospital. Hang in there.

672
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,520
We're almost at the hospital.

673
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,440
(Moojin Hospital)

674
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,520
Hello?

675
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,400
- Ms. Park. - Mr. Min.

676
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,760
- I'm heading to... - We have a problem.

677
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,840
Your son was found unconscious in the mountain.

678
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,720
He's on his way to Moojin Hospital.

679
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,840
- He needs an operation now. - What?

680
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,600
We can't find the right heart...

681
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,920
My goodness.

682
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,560
Moo Gang.

683
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,040
Are you insane?

684
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,080
He's still alive.

685
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,480
He'll die anyway.

686
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,880
Or he will be brain-dead.

687
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,320
We must verify that his brain is dead...

688
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,520
What if he dies?

689
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,560
If he dies, his heart will stop too.

690
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,520
Then...

691
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,040
Moo Gang will die too.

692
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,760
Give me the scalpel.

693
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,200
No, I can't.

694
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,200
I can't do that. This is murder.

695
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,120
Mr. Min, you like me, don't you?

696
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,440
I'm sorry for rejecting you all this time.

697
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,320
- Ms. Park. - If Moo Gang dies,

698
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,760
I'll die with him.

699
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,360
Do you want me to die?

700
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,760
No, you can't do this.

701
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,120
You can stay out of it.

702
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,720
I'll save Moo Gang...

703
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,720
no matter what.

704
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,880
In order to save Moo Gang,

705
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,560
you did that to a child?

706
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,600
Your...

707
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,520
blood type was rare.

708
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,680
Rejection would occur after a regular transplant.

709
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,000
You needed a transplant of the same blood type.

710
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,760
It was difficult to find a donor because it was too rare.

711
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,320
Coincidentally, Moo Chan had the same blood type as you.

712
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,760
I couldn't think of anything else.

713
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,000
All I wanted...

714
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,600
was to save my son, Moo Gang.

715
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,600
Either way,

716
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,240
he was going to die at the hospital.

717
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,120
Your brother was shot in the head.

718
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,800
He had no chance of living.

719
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,440
You're lying.

720
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,440
No.

721
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,200
He would have lived.

722
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,800
At that time,

723
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,920
I didn't see any shadow around Joon.

724
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,760
If you took him to the hospital,

725
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,040
he would have survived.

726
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,880
Moo Gang, I did it for you.

727
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,120
Moo Gang.

728
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,240
- Moo Gang. - Murderer.

729
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,920
You're a murderer!

730
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,520
You were afraid that the truth would be revealed.

731
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,920
Is that why you went to the US with Moo Gang?

732
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,680
Do you realize what you did?

733
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,440
Joon isn't the only one you killed!

734
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,840
While Moo Gang tried to find out the truth about Joon's death...

735
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,000
Is that why...

736
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,680
Is that why you swapped the bodies?

737
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,320
You threw Joon's body into the sea!

738
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
You.

739
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,080
Listen carefully.

740
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,160
I'll send you to the fiery pit.

741
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,840
You'll be safe now, Moo Gang.

742
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Does anyone know...

743
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,640
that we used the operating room?

744
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,360
No.

745
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,320
Everyone is busy with the Time Mart incident.

746
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,840
By the way,

747
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,440
what about Moo Gang's brother's body at the clinic?

748
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,040
Once they find his body without a heart, they'll investigate.

749
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,720
I have an idea.

750
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,160
This won't cause a problem.

751
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,960
Moo Gang's operation went well.

752
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,880
What if someone looks for the body?

753
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,240
It's been four days since the accident. No one is looking for him.

754
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,080
He must be an orphan.

755
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,160
The police will want to verify him.

756
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,760
Don't worry.

757
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,040
His face won't be recognizable.

758
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,840
They'll contact me as his guardian based on his belongings.

759
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,320
I only have to say that it's Moo Chan.

760
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,760
How could she do this to me?

761
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,280
I thought of her as my mother.

762
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,920
I liked and respected her so much.

763
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,040
But how could she do that to me?

764
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,080
My baby.

765
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,480
My poor baby.

766
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,840
Gosh, this smell.

767
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,960
I'm sorry.

768
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,200
I got a call while I was delivering fish.

769
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,480
Welcome.

770
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,480
Detective Han.

771
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,520
I'd like a bowl of...

772
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,360
intestine soup.

773
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,480
Enjoy the dish.

774
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,760
What are you doing?

775
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,920
What?

776
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,640
It was because I still remembered the intestine soup...

777
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,920
that my mom had cooked for me.

778
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,360
Thanks to you, I was able to find out who killed my son.

779
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,000
Joon will be able to rest in peace now.

780
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,480
Thank you.

781
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,920
Why aren't you eating?

782
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,800
You should eat before it gets cold.

783
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,840
It's nice to see that you like it.

784
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,320
Joon used to hate the intestine soup that I cooked for him.

785
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,120
But then again,

786
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,680
I guess it was because he didn't like me.

787
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,400
I'm sure he was embarrassed of me...

788
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,240
since I used to work at a bar as a prostitute.

789
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,000
I'm embarrassed!

790
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,120
I'm embarrassed of you.

791
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,440
If Joon ever gets to be born again,

792
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,720
I hope he gets to have great parents this time...

793
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,680
instead of being stuck with a pathetic mother like me.

794
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,680
I... No.

795
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,120
My brother...

796
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,720
told me that he wasn't such a good son to you.

797
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,880
Why are you so obsessed with the truth behind his death?

798
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,480
How could I give up on proving the truth when I'm his mother?

799
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,320
If you ever get to...

800
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,200
meet him again, what would you like to say?

801
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,120
I want to apologize.

802
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,120
I want to apologize for...

803
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,200
not trusting him when I was his mother.

804
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,360
He got himself in so much trouble.

805
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,600
So I thought he even got himself involved in selling drugs.

806
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,520
I was so disappointed in him because of that.

807
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,160
But I couldn't send my son to prison,

808
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,720
so I went on behalf of him.

809
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,680
You went to prison on behalf of him?

810
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,360
But later on, I found out that Yong Sik...

811
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,960
He used to be a really famous bully in Moojin.

812
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,520
He's come to his senses and is working at a car center now.

813
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,280
But the thing is,

814
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,200
he apparently put that darn thing in Joon's bag...

815
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,480
because Joon had told him that he no longer wanted to hang with him.

816
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,520
Then he reported Joon to the police.

817
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,200
I should've known.

818
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,680
Joon would've never done such a thing.

819
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,400
After some time,

820
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,840
I started feeling sorry...

821
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,800
for having been disappointed in him back then.

822
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,760
- I'll hold it. - No, it's okay.

823
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,840
Come in. Sit down.

824
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,000
The room's cold. I should light the furnace.

825
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,960
I have nothing much to give you.

826
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,560
I lit the furnace, so it'll be warm soon.

827
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,399
Please sit down.

828
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,960
Whenever I look at you,

829
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,800
I'm reminded of my son.

830
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,359
I guess that's because you're his brother.

831
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,080
You look very similar to him.

832
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,040
When I got discharged from prison,

833
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,600
all the bars had disappeared.

834
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,200
And my restaurant had turned into a mess.

835
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,359
I don't even have a single photo of Joon because of that.

836
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,279
I feel like time would pass by easily...

837
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,960
if I at least had a photo of him.

838
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,920
Then take a photo.

839
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,240
You said I look similar to Joon.

840
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,560
You can think of me as him.

841
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:36,600
Give me your cell phone.

842
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,880
Should I do that?

843
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,040
Here.

844
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,120
Look here.

845
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,920
There.

846
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,480
Look.

847
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,360
Okay.

848
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,240
- My gosh. - Congressman Kim Young Seok,

849
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,760
- a strong presidential candidate, - I can't believe...

850
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,200
- was involved in... - I almost voted for him.

851
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,880
There's not a single decent candidate.

852
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,480
His approval rating is starting to plummet after he's been...

853
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,360
involved in child prostitution.

854
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,960
- We expect a drastic change. - Who is it?

855
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,600
Who is it?

856
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,680
Are you okay?

857
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,640
Did he cry?

858
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,600
Did something happen?

859
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,760
What happened to him?

860
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,600
Dad said that red thread means fate.

861
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,520
Really?

862
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,160
Ha Ram.

863
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,840
I'm...

864
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,320
Joon.

865
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,680
Kim Joon.

866
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,880
You're Kim Young Seok's son?

867
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,880
Yes.

868
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,560
I don't like him, but I have no choice.

869
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,960
He's my father.

870
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,760
Your father...

871
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,040
killed my brother.

872
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,160
I can't forgive him.

873
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,600
Do you mean Kim Joon?

874
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,400
How do I know him?

875
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,640
We went to the same elementary school.

876
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,480
He was one grade above me.

877
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,240
He was famous for being a good fighter.

878
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,000
Moo Gang.

879
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,800
You're wrong about something.

880
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,600
The one who killed your brother...

881
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,200
isn't my father.

882
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,240
What do you mean?

883
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,120
I saw Joon that day.

884
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,680
My mom was sick,

885
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,920
so I was at the hospital every day after school.

886
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,400
I went home late.

887
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,960
I saw Joon that day.

888
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,080
It's Joon.

889
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,520
Is he hurt?

890
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,000
He was bleeding.

891
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,680
Why aren't they going to the hospital?

892
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,640
They headed somewhere else away from Moojin Hospital.

893
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,520
Why did they?

894
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,880
I just thought it was strange because I was too young then.

895
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,120
After Mom died, I moved in with Mom's family in Canada.

896
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,000
I completely forgot what I saw.

897
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,400
Then I found out later.

898
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,240
Your brother was found...

899
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,320
near the freeway by the ocean the next morning.

900
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,400
Isn't it strange?

901
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,280
I saw your mom take him to the freeway.

902
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,680
He got into a hit-and-run accident.

903
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,520
Stop beating around the bush.

904
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,240
20 years ago on April 20,

905
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,320
he donated his heart to you.

906
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,200
Moo Gang.

907
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,720
You fought well.

908
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,760
Let's go to the US when you're released from the hospital tomorrow.

909
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,240
- Mom. - Yes?

910
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,680
Who is the donor of my heart transplant?

911
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,360
When you lost consciousness, there was a girl near Moojin...

912
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,600
whose brain died after an accident.

913
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,800
She saved your life.

914
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,000
Ahn Hyung Joon?

915
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,200
(Notice of Organ Donations)

916
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,000
Why is her heart in his body?

917
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,360
Moo Gang.

918
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,760
Didn't you get a heart transplant that day?

919
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,480
How can 1 heart be given to 2 people?

920
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,000
No matter how much you try,

921
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,560
you can't find your transplant document.

922
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,160
Then who's the donor...

923
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,080
of your heart?

924
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,280
When I got my blood tested at school,

925
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,240
they said it was A Rh negative.

926
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,640
This can't be.

927
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,520
Your mom stole your brother's heart for you.

928
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,680
What?

929
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,240
If you don't believe me,

930
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,040
ask your mother yourself.

931
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,920
Moo Gang.

932
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,840
Even if you expose my father's tape,

933
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,120
it'll be useless.

934
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,240
Do you understand me?

935
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,320
If you expose his tape,

936
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,040
you won't be safe.

937
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,040
Just drop the case.

938
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,160
Drop it.

939
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,320
Help me.

940
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,560
Call 911.

941
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,360
Moo Gang.

942
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,320
You threw away evidence that can prove what your mom did.

943
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,160
On top of that, you killed Leo who knew the truth.

944
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,600
Moo Gang.

945
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,280
Were you trying to cover up my death?

946
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,560
I'll make your mother pay for what she did.

947
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,480
Your brother was shot in the head.

948
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,120
He had no chance of living.

949
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,680
Who could have shot him?

950
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,600
Who shot me?

951
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,440
Where's Sun Young?

952
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,560
She went back into the mountain to look for you.

953
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,720
Didn't you see her?

954
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,760
Kim Young Seok.

955
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,440
He was there 20 years ago.

956
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,800
It was Kim Young Seok.

957
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,480
Soo Hyuk saw me...

958
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,160
getting shot by Kim Young Seok's gun.

959
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,080
Joon!

960
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,600
Is that why...

961
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,800
he ordered Young Choon to kill Kang Soo Hyuk?

962
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,800
Kim Young Seok will be released.

963
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,840
The police say that he's not guilty of assault, murder,

964
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,520
violence against you, or obstruction of justice.

965
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,600
What?

966
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,480
It wasn't a proper investigation,

967
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,920
so they won't accept anything.

968
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,240
Yoon Soo Wan's testimony went down the drain.

969
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,160
Congressman Kim Young Seok, who was arrested for assault, murder,

970
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,600
and obstruction of justice, was not indicted.

971
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,720
The police stated that...

972
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:34,080
as the investigation wasn't based on reasonable evidence,

973
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,880
the investigation results cannot be accepted.

974
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,760
What?

975
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,760
Kim Young Seok was released?

976
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,560
Find someone secretly.

977
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,920
Someone who makes no mistakes.

978
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,320
I must find the tape.

979
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,240
I'll find him and make him pay...

980
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,360
for shooting me.

981
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,920
He wasn't indicted?

982
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,560
This is nonsense.

983
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,600
He even confessed himself.

984
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,640
I can't do this anymore.

985
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,120
He didn't come here.

986
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,040
He doesn't answer his phone.

987
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,280
I see.

988
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,480
What happened? I'm worried about him.

989
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,040
I know something happened.

990
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,680
Let's see.

991
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,480
Moojin?

992
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,680
Why did he go to Moojin?

993
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,720
That's where I showed the tape to Young Choon.

994
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,280
The tape is here.

995
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,840
I took...

996
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,560
the videotape from Pumpkin Singer.

997
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,560
Sun Young.

998
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,120
What's going on?

999
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,600
My memory's not entirely back.

1000
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,600
Kim Young Seok's assault was recorded on that tape.

1001
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,200
Without knowing, I recorded on the same tape.

1002
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,920
Somebody...

1003
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,640
There was a tape in my bag.

1004
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,360
I was hiding over here after that.

1005
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,480
Kim Young Seok.

1006
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:29,320
I'll find that tape and make you pay for it.

1007
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,680
I couldn't have hidden the tape after getting shot.

1008
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:37,560
I must have hid it here somewhere before getting shot.

1009
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,560
Isn't this the place?

1010
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,160
(Map tracking)

1011
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,720
Why is he here?

1012
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,440
Kim Joon.

1013
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,720
Where did I put it?

1014
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,560
Why don't I remember where I hid it?

1015
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,440
What's this?

1016
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,200
This isn't from a hunting rifle.

1017
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,800
What are you doing?

1018
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,280
Ha Ram.

1019
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,360
You weren't answering your phone, so I was worried.

1020
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,360
I tracked you on Friend Locator.

1021
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,800
How do you know about this place?

1022
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,280
Do you know this place?

1023
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,000
I told you last time.

1024
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,520
Do you remember when I said I tried to kill...

1025
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,800
my dad's shadow?

1026
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,680
This was the place.

1027
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,960
What?

1028
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,200
Dad.

1029
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,640
Dad, there's a shadow.

1030
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,520
- I lost him for a while. - It's Dad.

1031
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,480
Then I saw him entering here.

1032
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,560
No, Dad.

1033
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,720
That's Dad's rifle.

1034
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,120
If I get rid of the shadow,

1035
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,240
Dad won't die.

1036
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,360
The one who shot me...

1037
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,320
I thought...

1038
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,600
if I shot the shadow,

1039
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,040
I'd save my dad.

1040
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,120
However, it was useless.

1041
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,640
Detective Han.

1042
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,720
Detective Han, are you okay?

1043
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,280
Stay away from me.

1044
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,800
Are you okay?

1045
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,200
Detective Han.

1046
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,800
(Black)

1047
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,040
Because of your unfortunate vision...

1048
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,360
Does Ha Ram know something about that tape?

1049
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,560
I have an idea. I'll take care of it.

1050
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,600
I'll cherish your heart.

1051
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,440
I'll forget everything and protect you.

1052
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,200
Detective Han knew about it.

1053
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,080
There's one last thing I must do.
