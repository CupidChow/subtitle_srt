1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,760
- Repeal. - Repeal.

2
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,680
Stop the act.

3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,440
- Stop the act. - Stop the act.

4
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,400
- This is it. - Get off.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,480
- Get off. - Get off.

6
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
- Let go of her! Stop it! - What is this?

7
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
What are you?

8
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,440
Fire? It wasn't here.

9
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
(Choi Joon Seok)

10
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,720
You're driving me crazy. Why did you leave the kids in there?

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Gosh...

12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,960
You jerks...

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,600
- I'll teach you a lesson. - Where are the kids?

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,039
Let go! Let go of me.

15
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,680
(Reveal the truth! Tell me why my son died!)

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,960
(You already killed hundreds, Will you kill more)

17
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
- I'll go check on them. - Okay.

18
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,240
The kid... Gosh. Where is he?

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,720
- Over there. He's over there. - Sorry?

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,080
- There? Where exactly... Gosh! - Yes! Gosh!

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,640
Ha Ram. Hey!

22
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,200
You said you'd like the vanilla flavor, right?

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,600
Just one vanilla ice cream, please.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,800
- The spaghetti... - It looks like you're having fun.

25
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,000
- Yes. - Are you playing with your dolls?

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,040
- Yes. - Yes.

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
Your parents will be back soon.

28
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,079
- What is that? - Seriously.

29
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,400
Let go. Enough, you punks.

30
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,680
Stop it!

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,400
Stop... Stop it already, you jerk.

32
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm a police officer. Hey!

33
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Freeze! Stay still, you jerks.

34
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,600
Unless you want me to put a hole through your brain.

35
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Where did she go now?

36
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
What? Who did this?

37
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,120
Gosh, what should I do?

38
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,120
My goodness.

39
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,279
Hello? Is anybody inside?

40
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
Help us, please.

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,120
- Here. - Are you okay, sir?

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,440
- There are kids inside. - Kids...

43
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,240
Gosh, what should we do?

44
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,680
What's going on over there? Gosh, this is crazy.

45
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,960
How can I get this open?

46
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,840
Joon. Joon, help me with this.

47
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,200
What should I do? I can't open this lock.

48
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
There are kids inside. What should we do?

49
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,120
Plus, most of the souls were kids.

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Kids who didn't know why they had to die.

51
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,560
Kids who had so many days to live ahead.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,560
Collecting souls of kids,

53
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
who were full of dreams about their future,

54
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,280
obviously couldn't have been easy.

55
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,800
It won't take long. Wait just a little, okay?

56
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,560
No.

57
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,680
I should never get involved in attempts to save human lives.

58
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,920
What should I do?

59
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
Kids, wait just a little longer, okay?

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,840
No.

61
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,320
We call those who have lost their spouses by death...

62
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,159
"widow" or "widower".

63
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,320
And kids who have lost their parents are called orphans.

64
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,400
But do you know what parents...

65
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,200
who have lost their children are called?

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,760
There's no such word.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,560
It's so cruel...

68
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,240
that there's no word for it.

69
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,520
Step back.

70
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,000
Come out!

71
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,280
- No, what should we do? - Joon Seok!

72
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Joon Seok!

73
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,840
Rescue them quickly!

74
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,920
- Hurry up! - My son...

75
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,159
- Joon Seok! - My son!

76
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
- What's this? What is this? - Open the door!

77
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,760
- Come out! - Call the ambulance now!

78
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,520
- Dad... - Come here.

79
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,320
Where's the ambulance? Is the ambulance here yet?

80
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,400
- Where's Joon Seok? - Joon Seok!

81
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,680
Isn't that Ha Ram?

82
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,080
Why is she here?

83
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,400
Ha Ram!

84
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
Ha Ram!

85
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Ha Ram!

86
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,680
- Joon Seok! - My child...

87
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,600
- Hey, get out of my way! - My child is still in there!

88
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
Ha Ram!

89
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,720
Hey!

90
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,960
Let me get you out of here.

91
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,520
Come here. Get out of there.

92
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,560
- I don't want to. - Gosh.

93
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,600
Do whatever you want then.

94
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,360
It's okay. Come here, okay?

95
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
- I don't want to. I'm scared. - Come on.

96
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,600
- It's okay. It's all right. - I'm scared.

97
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,640
Come out. Come on.

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,480
There you did it. Good girl.

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,440
All right. You're fine now.

100
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,760
Get out.

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
- Thank you. - Get out of here now.

102
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,680
Okay.

103
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,480
Ha Ram.

104
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,480
- Joon Seok! - He hasn't come out yet.

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,760
(Choi Joon Seok)

106
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,440
- Joon. - Let's get out of here.

107
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,000
I think Hoon Seok's dad is still inside.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Get this kid out of here first.

109
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,840
What?

110
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,320
Hey, hey!

111
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
Come here.

112
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,160
- Are you in there? Hoon Seok... - Hey!

113
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,680
- Come on. Let's go. - Joon.

114
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,039
Enough, already!

115
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,440
You said that you never want to die.

116
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Just a minute.

117
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,159
- Hey! - Mister!

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,480
Mister...

119
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,240
Mister, wake up.

120
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,320
Wake up. You can't die!

121
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,520
You need to save your son's life. Please wake up!

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
Come here.

123
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,840
Wake up. Please wake up!

124
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,640
Wake up already!

125
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,800
- Ha Ram! - You have to save your son's life.

126
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,560
- Where are you, Ha Ram? - Joon, I'm here.

127
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,280
- Help him. - Move. Just get out of here!

128
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,400
Excuse me.

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
- Please help me. - Let's go!

130
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,600
- Take this kid, and get out. - What?

131
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,520
Where are you going now?

132
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,080
- Are you under here? - Help me.

133
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,160
- Just a moment. - Over here.

134
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,080
My gosh.

135
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,560
Come out. Hurry up!

136
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,480
We can't let them die in there.

137
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,600
- All right. - Send us more ambulances!

138
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,240
- His current condition is... - Send us more ambulances now!

139
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,240
You only sent us three.

140
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,320
- Take him. - Hurry up!

141
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,840
The ambulances are over there.

142
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
Get the kids in first.

143
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,440
Do it like this. From the side. Slowly now.

144
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,120
- Hey, come here. - Is his face seriously injured?

145
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,400
Are you okay? Did you get any injuries?

146
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,120
What's gotten into you? It's so unlike you to try to rescue a kid.

147
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,240
Then what? No parents would just walk out...

148
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,160
when a child is dying right in front of them, you wench.

149
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,360
By the way, what brings you here?

150
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
That's none of your business.

151
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,760
Well, Hoon Seok is waiting for your marrow. You should hurry.

152
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
Okay, thanks.

153
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,440
You said that your life motto is to never die, didn't you?

154
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,680
How can you be so reckless when you're that attached to life?

155
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Look at what you did today.

156
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,120
You jumped into the fire multiple times to save lives.

157
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,520
You might die if you keep that up.

158
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,760
I just can't understand you.

159
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,640
All humans fear death. Doesn't it scare you? Don't you fear death?

160
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Who doesn't fear death? I'm scared of it too.

161
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
But...

162
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,600
I fear it less than seeing someone die...

163
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,680
right in front of my eyes.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,160
Give me that.

165
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,960
Just stay still.

166
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
It's making your ugly face look even uglier.

167
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,360
- Goodness. - What is all this?

168
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,880
Close your eyes. The soot will get into your eyes.

169
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,720
Close your eyes.

170
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
What's wrong?

171
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,640
One ambulance just left the site.

172
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,080
Nothing.

173
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,960
Wipe it yourself. Here.

174
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,960
Do you have no hands or what?

175
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,840
What's with him? He said he'd do it for me. Why is he so fickle-minded?

176
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,440
We didn't do it.

177
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,840
I'm telling you the truth. We never locked that door,

178
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,480
and we didn't start the fire either.

179
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,520
Please just answer my question.

180
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,240
- Hang on a second. - Gwang Gyun, please. Seriously.

181
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,880
All right, just for a second. I can't stand these jerks.

182
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,280
Are you saying that this barrel of oil...

183
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,640
- did this on its own? - Gosh, seriously.

184
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,000
Goodness, stop it.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,480
How dare you lie to our faces?

186
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,800
We have solid evidence right here!

187
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,520
All of them were found in your car, you jerks.

188
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,240
That's just something we...

189
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,120
Just what? Just to scare them, right?

190
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,280
Weren't you going to say that?

191
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,200
Thugs always give the same excuses ever since the 50s.

192
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,920
- You guys are so predictable. - Gwang Gyun.

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,160
We'll take care of this, so please leave us alone, okay? I'm sorry.

194
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,120
You idiot. They're lying because you're acting like a pushover.

195
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,400
The world is changing so fast.

196
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,080
Look, we now use things like cell phones and...

197
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,640
- credit card bills arrive by text! - You jerks deserve to be stuffed...

198
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,040
with hydrochloric acid and thrown into the Pacific Ocean!

199
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
Let me ask you something first.

200
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
Why did you come to Moojin?

201
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,600
I was running some errands.

202
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,560
Errands? What errands?

203
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
What about you? Why were you there?

204
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,400
Me? I was running errands.

205
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,480
Errands? What errands?

206
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,000
My gosh, you brat.

207
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,240
Forget it. The skeleton I told you about.

208
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,880
If you remember anything about it, tell me right away. Okay?

209
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,520
You brat.

210
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
They say everyone has a talent.

211
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
What's your relationship with that girl?

212
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,040
It's none of your business.

213
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,720
Why you little...

214
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,240
Royeol Complex Shopping Mall...

215
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,120
How could you mess this up? I told you to scare them.

216
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
- Why did you lock up children? - There was a fire.

217
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,920
- A congressman got injured as well. - The children of protesters...

218
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,040
How are you going to settle this mess?

219
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,440
I think someone pulled a trick.

220
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,240
It's my fault that I didn't check...

222
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,400
- We're not open yet. - Darn it.

223
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,080
Why did you lie to me? Why?

224
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,400
What do you think you're doing?

225
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,880
Clara didn't run away, did she?

226
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,760
What on earth happened that night?

227
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,360
Tell me! Tell me the truth!

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
Well, about that.

229
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,600
Well... It was a troubled time...

230
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,480
because a mart collapsed downtown.

231
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,040
Oh, right. It was the day when they found Woo Byung Sik's body.

232
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,240
Jin Sook said...

233
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,640
Clara dragged Sun Young by the hair to the mountain.

234
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,840
She talked gibberish, saying we need to find them.

235
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,280
So we went to look for them together,

236
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,640
but we couldn't find them anywhere.

237
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,520
We gave up and came back to the bar.

238
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,440
We never saw Clara and Sun Young after that day.

239
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
Jin Sook also disappeared after that.

240
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,880
That means Clara didn't run away.

241
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,200
Why did you lie to me that she did? Why?

242
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,840
It's you, isn't it?

243
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,560
You took the money and the bankbook from Clara's house, didn't you?

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
That's why you didn't even report her...

245
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,000
as a missing person, isn't it?

246
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,280
No, that's...

247
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,560
If I had left it there,

248
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,560
the police would've taken it all.

249
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,440
I thought it'd be better for me to keep it...

250
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,080
and when Clara comes back...

251
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,800
Stop lying!

252
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,040
If you had left it there,

253
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,360
I would've believed that Clara didn't run away.

254
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,240
I would've found her by any means.

255
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,680
If I had, she wouldn't have...

256
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,560
returned like this.

257
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,760
Is this Clara?

258
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,520
Oh, dear.

259
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,800
When you met Han Jin Sook again,

260
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,040
did she really not say anything about what happened that day?

261
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,320
She didn't.

262
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,960
That's not a lie.

263
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,360
I was curious too, so I asked her about it to find them myself.

264
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,640
But whenever I brought up Clara's name,

265
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,120
she kept her mouth shut.

266
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,400
But...

267
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,520
something must've happened indeed. Jin Sook said...

268
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,680
she and Sun Young promised not to talk about it forever.

269
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,079
And if they do, that man would kill her.

270
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,760
"That man"?

271
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,720
Who is that?

272
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,359
I don't know that.

273
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,160
Jin Sook seemed so scared.

274
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,520
He probably...

275
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,760
killed...

276
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,360
Jin Sook too.

277
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,720
Detective.

278
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,040
Hi.

279
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,840
Look. Did your wife tell you anything about her old friend?

280
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Her childhood friend?

281
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,120
Do you remember anything your wife said to you about her friend?

282
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,880
I don't think she told me anything about a friend.

283
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,880
Do you remember anything at all?

284
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,400
Pardon?

285
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,040
Never mind.

286
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,760
Anyway, if you remember anything, call me right away. Okay?

287
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,160
- Answer me. - I will.

288
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,280
Why didn't they talk more? They were married.

289
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,400
My gosh.

290
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,800
Why is that jerk being so rude to me?

291
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,440
He thinks he's a big man because he's a detective.

292
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,080
Gosh.

293
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,800
Welcome...

294
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,920
Goodness, why is he here again?

295
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,960
(Emergency Medical Center)

296
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Why did you want to come here again?

297
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,400
I need to check if Hoon Seok's shadow is gone.

298
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,120
Thank you for the ride.

299
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,120
What have I done today?

300
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
I can't believe I saved humans.

301
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,560
I must be insane.

302
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Ha Ram.

303
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
Are you hurt anywhere?

304
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,320
Hoon Seok isn't going to die.

305
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,880
His dad told me what happened.

306
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,360
You went there to save his life.

307
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,680
What happened? Did you get burned?

308
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,360
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,040
I knew it might put you in danger,

310
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,400
but I wasn't in my right mind then...

311
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
because of Hoon Seok.

312
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,120
I didn't think you had any maternal love.

313
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,120
How could you be so affectionate towards Hoon Seok?

314
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,960
You try so hard to save a boy to whom you're not even related by blood.

315
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,800
Why did you do that to me, your real daughter?

316
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,560
Why did you try to kill me?

317
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
What?

318
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,840
I always wanted to ask you this.

319
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,360
I was struggling not to die.

320
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,560
Why did you do that to me?

321
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,280
Take it. Take it!

322
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,520
- Take it, and let's die together. - Dad!

323
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,680
Take it!

324
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,520
I've thought about it hundreds of times,

325
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,640
but I just can't understand.

326
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Tell me.

327
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,680
Why did you try to kill me then?

328
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,640
Why did you do that?

329
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,040
I was scared.

330
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
I did it because I was scared.

331
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,920
What?

332
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,440
You were scared?

333
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
Did I look like a monster to you?

334
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Is that why you tried to kill me?

335
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,440
Is that it?

336
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm your daughter.

337
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,440
What kind of mother is scared of her own daughter?

338
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,280
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,440
Joon, you're still here.

340
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,480
I have nothing else to do at home anyway.

341
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,200
I have some time on my hands.

342
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,480
I thought maybe I could drive you home, but you didn't come out.

343
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Joon. Hoon Seok's shadow is gone now.

344
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,240
Isn't that great news? I guess his surgery will go well.

345
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,960
Isn't it great that he didn't die like a heroine in a tragic story?

346
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,320
It's an illness that doesn't suit that fatty in the first place.

347
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,520
Everyone seems safe and fine now.

348
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm so relieved.

349
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,080
Let's go, Joon.

350
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,560
But you're not fine.

351
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Did...

352
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,600
Did you hear it?

353
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,800
Yes.

354
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,720
If you want to cry, go ahead.

355
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,120
Hey. How long do I have to stay here?

356
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,920
It's tiring to act like I'm sick. Get me out of here.

357
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,360
Gosh, I'm bored.

358
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
("Rat")

359
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,040
This is the script of the new drama I'll be filming, right? "Rat"?

360
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,640
You can't leave tonight. They can discharge you tomorrow afternoon.

361
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,480
Do you remember the girl who tried to die at the broadcasting station?

362
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,320
- What about it? - Get me her script.

363
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,480
(Case report)

364
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,600
Gosh, you brat.

365
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,440
I told you not to pick your nose at work.

366
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,720
Sorry? I don't pick my nose now.

367
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,600
What is this then? Isn't this blood from your nose?

368
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,520
Oh, that picture was under Moo Gang's desk.

369
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
- I picked it up and attached it. - Is that so?

370
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,880
That brat kept the evidence without telling me.

371
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
So this means...

372
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,560
the man who killed Han Jin Sook...

373
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,680
may be the same person who killed Clara 20 years ago.

374
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,280
If Woo Byung Sik really killed Han Jin Sook,

375
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,640
he could have killed Clara 20 years ago too...

376
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,400
since his body we found was a fake then.

377
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,320
- Hello? - Hi. This is the watch expert.

378
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,480
I checked the parts. It's certain that Schneider made it himself,

379
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,800
but a number was written on it.

380
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,360
What? A number?

381
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes. Number two.

382
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,840
I've never seen a part made by Schneider that had a number on it.

383
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,280
If it's number two, I thought maybe there is the same watch somewhere.

384
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,880
But you said that watch craftsman or whatever...

385
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,960
makes only one watch with the same design.

386
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,200
Yes. That's what I heard.

387
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,400
It may not have the same design.

388
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,200
Okay, I see. Thank you.

389
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,200
- This is so confusing. - Crazy Dog.

390
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,840
It's not Woo Byung Sik.

391
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,280
The person who killed Han Jin Sook isn't Woo Byung Sik.

392
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,040
I'm confused as it is. What are you talking about now?

393
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,080
Look at this. Here.

394
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,560
- Can you see it? "September 14"? - Yes.

395
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,560
- He was in the Philippines then, - What?

396
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,480
but the date on the security camera footage of Han Jin Sook is also...

397
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,600
- September 14. - That's right.

398
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,480
He couldn't have been in two different countries on the same day.

399
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,120
The man with the watch Jin Sook met on that day wasn't him.

400
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,960
It means there is another man.

401
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,120
Because of this and what happened to Sang Min,

402
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,560
the netizens are boycotting our products.

403
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,120
It looks quite serious.

404
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
You should stop the construction and open a press conference.

405
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,400
Royeol Complex Shopping Mall...

406
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,960
is a business I'm leading.

407
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,640
If I give up here,

408
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,920
the board of directors will drag me down by any means.

409
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,560
If they build a mall on this unstable land...

410
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,640
Until my dad dies,

411
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,080
- I shouldn't get on their nerves. - The same disaster can't...

412
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,840
- Just buy me time. - happen again.

413
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,080
- I strongly hope it won't. - If this blows over,

414
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,400
- Please. - resume the construction.

415
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,440
My gosh. Here comes the big hero.

416
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,120
You're saving humans' lives out in the open now.

417
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
How are you going to deal with it later?

418
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,360
I had no choice.

419
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,120
Ha Ram was looking at me.

420
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
If I hadn't saved them, she would've suspected me.

421
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,120
That's such a lame excuse.

422
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,480
I really...

423
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,280
What happened to you?

424
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,640
Why did you change your looks?

425
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,760
You liked your old face. You kept it for a while.

426
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,240
Doesn't it have some swag in it? Some impact.

427
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,360
Since when did you like teenagers?

428
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,200
It's not a unique face either.

429
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,400
It's not something you'd like.

430
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,600
This is a unique face. I absolutely love it.

431
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
How dare you raise your voice at me?

432
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
You brat.

433
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,640
Oh, right. Let me ask you something.

434
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,280
- What... What? - Can we really have a human's face?

435
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,120
My face isn't... No.

436
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,920
This isn't a human's face. It really isn't.

437
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,560
What are you saying? I wasn't talking about you.

438
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,320
I meant 419.

439
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,560
419? Isn't that your former partner?

440
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,560
That's right. Do you remember the face he had on his last duty?

441
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,160
It looked exactly like that human's face that Crazy Dog showed me.

442
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,200
Hey, what are you doing?

443
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,080
What? Well,

444
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,360
About that...

445
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,360
We cannot have the face of a real human.

446
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,680
It's our rule. Have you forgotten?

447
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,480
- Right? - Yes. You just saw a similar face.

448
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,720
Those who make us our faces...

449
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
look at real humans' faces as reference.

450
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm sure there are a few similar faces.

451
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,640
Yes, yes. All right. That must be it.

452
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,880
Yes. You're right.

453
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,120
I'm sure it was just a similar face.

454
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,880
That's right.

455
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,080
I'm tired.

456
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,920
Go in early today.

457
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,000
It's so hard to act.

458
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,560
You little...

459
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,720
By the way, why are you still dawdling here?

460
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,120
Go back to the underworld if you got your body and memories back.

461
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,720
If Black gets his body and memories back,

462
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,840
I'll leave with him.

463
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,080
"I'll leave with him." My goodness.

464
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,920
What do you like so much about that rude brat?

465
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,720
Is that the only reason?

466
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,320
What do you mean?

467
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,120
Did you really save other humans...

468
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,240
because you were worried that the girl might find out?

469
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,720
To be honest,

470
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,280
the children were looking at me over the window.

471
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,280
I couldn't turn away from them.

472
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,120
Stop drinking. You can't even drink that much.

473
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,840
How can you be drinking again after all that trouble?

474
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,280
My dear Sip Gyeon...

475
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,680
(Ms. Fortune-teller)

476
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,400
Hello?

477
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,440
He doesn't have anywhere to go right now. Could he stay here for...

478
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,560
No.

479
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,600
There is no choice then.

480
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,760
I should take him to my place.

481
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,040
What? Where? Are you crazy?

482
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,200
Please let him stay with you for a few days.

483
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,120
Mr. Oh.

484
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,400
Mr. Oh, wake up.

485
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,120
That punk.

486
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,720
You fool. Why did you let a human stay in your house?

487
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,320
What else could I do? Ha Ram said she'd take him to her place.

488
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,440
Whether he stays with her or lives with her, just leave them.

489
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,840
Are you crazy? I'd never... What are you talking about?

490
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,160
If a human stays here, it'd be inconvenient for us.

491
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,680
We can't come and go freely as we want.

492
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,360
He can't even see you anyway.

493
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,840
But when we talk,

494
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,800
this young gentleman will think it's strange.

495
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,760
Gentleman, my foot. Forget it then.

496
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,760
I can understand him.

497
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,440
He wouldn't want to let someone so handsome stay in Ha Ram's place.

498
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,360
("The Disaster of Royeol")

499
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,440
Hi, Ha Ram.

500
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,080
Did Mr. Oh wake up?

501
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,360
He's not eating anything, right? Should I bring over some porridge?

502
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,040
He's eating fine, so mind your own business!

503
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,320
He's not her boss anymore, but she still cares about him.

504
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,120
It's so nice that people deliver fried chicken 24 hours a day.

505
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,520
Fried chicken is the best for a hangover.

506
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,880
Can I order one more?

507
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,240
What?

508
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,040
You're such a big sponger. Get out.

509
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,240
Get out now!

510
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,640
- What? - You piece of trash.

511
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,480
I can't stand you anymore, so get out of here.

512
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,120
Go. Leave.

513
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,280
My gosh.

514
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,320
- Hurry up, and leave. - My goodness.

515
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,520
You're making me feel upset.

516
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,200
I thought we'd be able to...

517
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,880
use this chance to become close.

518
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,240
I don't even have anywhere to go.

519
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,560
I guess I should go to Ms. Fortune-teller's house.

520
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
What?

521
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,240
Where do you think you're going?

522
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,280
Ms. Fortune-teller...

523
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,000
You... You can order more. Order as much as you want.

524
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,960
You can order everything on the menu.

525
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,600
Like you said, we're friends, right?

526
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,640
So let's stick next to each other...

527
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,120
and be friends for a really long time.

528
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,680
Go ahead, and order more.

529
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,000
I've thought about it after you visited last time,

530
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,400
and something came to my mind.

531
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,440
What is it?

532
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,200
I don't know if it's her friend.

533
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,240
But Jin Sook once had to go to a hospital because...

534
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,160
she had gotten into an accident on her way home.

535
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,200
And she started getting angry at me as soon as she came home.

536
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,360
"She looks exactly the same as when she was young."

537
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,840
"I aged so much because I ended up getting married to you."

538
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,640
That's what she said to me.

539
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,720
I recalled having fought with her back then.

540
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,400
- An accident? - Yes.

541
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,800
Which hospital did she go to?

542
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,360
It was Royeol Hospital.

543
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,120
There was a patient who came in because of a minor collision.

544
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,280
I signed her up for insurance because I felt sorry for her.

545
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,560
Could it be...

546
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,200
Hey, So Tae. Detective Park.

547
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,520
My gosh, where is everyone?

548
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,840
(Identification Search: Yoon Soo Wan)

549
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,600
(Identification Search: Yoon Soo Wan)

550
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,480
(Identification Number)

551
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,320
They're of the same age.

552
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,360
(Identification Search: Yoon Soo Wan)

553
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,199
Unit 407.

554
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,679
Number 22. It's here.

555
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,800
Ms. Yoon, are you inside?

556
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,840
Ms. Yoon Soo Wan?

557
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,360
Ms. Yoon, are you home?

558
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,600
A detective will visit you. Don't meet him.

559
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,400
Ms. Yoon.

560
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,960
Ms. Yoon, are you inside?

561
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,160
Doctor Yoon doesn't work here anymore.

562
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,440
Hey, So Tae. Remember Hwang Mi Ja from Santorini?

563
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Give me her home address via text. Okay.

564
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,080
What's this?

565
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,120
I went grocery shopping to cook something for Mr. Oh.

566
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,840
What? He's not here right now.

567
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,640
Really? Where did he go?

568
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,760
I don't know. He was gone when I came out of the shower.

569
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,080
He even wore my clothes.

570
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,440
That black suit?

571
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,480
Gosh, I only have that one suit.

572
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,200
What a beggar.

573
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,160
He probably doesn't even have anywhere to go.

574
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,680
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave...

575
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,360
He's not picking up.

576
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,760
You don't think...

577
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,040
he'll do anything drastic, do you?

578
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,680
Don't worry. He's not going to die.

579
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,440
My gosh, how can you be so sure?

580
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,000
You don't even have the ability to see shadows like me.

581
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,320
You're right. I don't.

582
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,480
But anyway, he'll be fine.

583
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,200
If he wore that dark suit,

584
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,920
he might've gone to see Sip Gyeon.

585
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,640
I'll go now.

586
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,640
My gosh, that boss of hers is such a pain.

587
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,640
Wait for me!

588
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,920
What brings you all the way to my house?

589
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
Is she Kim Sun Young?

590
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,400
No.

591
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,840
Look carefully.

592
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,080
Fine, Sun Young. Stick next to Han Moo Gang,

593
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,400
and find that videotape no matter what.

594
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,120
This is a photo from 20 years ago.

595
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,480
The photo has a low definition because my phone's old.

596
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,120
It's not her.

597
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,320
She looks completely different.

598
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,040
Are you sure?

599
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,000
Okay. If you recall any memories about Kim Sun Young,

600
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,880
call me right away. Okay?

601
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,280
Okay.

602
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,400
If you ever try to escape again,

603
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,560
- Where did he put it? - not only will you die,

604
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,680
but Han Moo Gang will die as well.

605
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,120
I found it.

606
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,480
(Record Shop)

607
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,200
Joon.

608
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
What song are you listening to?

609
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,160
Gosh, this song is amazing. You should listen to it too.

610
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Here.

611
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,800
If I was

612
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,400
- Joon, let's eat. - The sky

613
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,120
I want to be colored in your face

614
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,040
Just like the reddening evening

615
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,920
Of when the sun sets

616
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,280
I want to be colored in your cheeks

617
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,600
If I was a poet

618
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,360
I would sing for you

619
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,920
(To Sun Young.)

620
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,360
(Happy birthday. I managed to get tickets to Ahn Chi Hwan's concert.)

621
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,800
(I also lined up all night to get you an autographed CD.)

622
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,320
Then...

623
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,400
was he there that day to give me this?

624
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,760
Where is it? Where's the videotape?

625
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,040
- You brat! - Don't hit her!

626
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,560
Who are you? Who do you think you are?

627
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,440
No! Stop it!

628
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,240
Did Joon die because of me?

629
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,560
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave...

630
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,120
He's not at the columbarium, and he won't even pick up his phone.

631
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,640
Where in the world did he go?

632
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,600
You should go inside.

633
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,600
I'll go check the internet cafes near the neighborhood.

634
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Again?

635
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,800
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

636
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,720
She cares so much about that boss of hers.

637
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,920
My gosh, where did he go?

638
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,120
Have you been well, Moo Gang?

639
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,560
You're that doctor.

640
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,240
How do you feel?

641
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,520
Do you feel okay? Does it hurt anywhere?

642
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
What are you doing here?

643
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,600
You disappeared that day.

644
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,440
There was a sudden blackout that day.

645
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,520
I couldn't even say goodbye because I was late for my flight.

646
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
I don't think I can live without you.

647
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,040
That's why I came back.

648
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,760
Let's start over again.

649
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,160
Let's work on our relationship together, would you?

650
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,880
You didn't eat dinner, did you?

651
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,800
Sit down.

652
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,000
Put that away.

653
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,000
What's wrong? You love noodle soup with red beans.

654
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,160
Here. Try some.

655
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,240
I told you to put that away!

656
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,400
Gosh, it's hot.

657
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,440
Han Moo Gang, this jerk.

658
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,480
Why does his favorite food have to be red beans?

659
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,480
I have no use for him at all.

660
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,680
My gosh, it's hot.

661
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,800
Let me see.

662
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,800
It's okay.

663
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
I just fell.

664
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,960
Why is she lying?

665
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
This kind of scar comes from torture.

666
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm fine. I didn't get burned that much.

667
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,520
Does this really help?

668
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Why?

669
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,280
Does it hurt more?

670
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,320
I heard that cold water helps.

671
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,640
I'm sorry, Moo Gang.

672
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,720
Joon, did Mr. Oh come home yet?

673
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,920
Hello.

674
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,760
I... I came in because the front gate was open. I'm sorry.

675
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,360
I'll... I'll go now.

676
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,240
"Joon"?

677
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,800
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

678
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,840
"Joon"?

679
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,040
Why is she calling you Joon?

680
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,320
Did you...

681
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,480
also know that I had an older brother?

682
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
Do you...

683
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,080
remember everything now?

684
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,280
No.

685
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,600
Then how did you find out?

686
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,640
I saw this and asked Moo Gang's...

687
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,360
No.

688
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,560
I asked my mom about this. Why?

689
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,160
But why is she calling you Joon?

690
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,320
Well...

691
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,320
Well, I really need her help with an investigation.

692
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,160
She's helping me because she thinks I'm her hometown friend, Joon.

693
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,840
And I'm pretending to be him.

694
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,880
So you can never tell her that...

695
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,800
I'm not Joon. Do you understand?

696
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,040
- But... - Just keep that in mind, okay?

697
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,320
Okay.

698
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,920
I won't say anything.

699
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,880
I'll go now.

700
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,400
I hope that doctor...

701
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,520
doesn't say anything.

702
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,200
Hey, Ms. Fortune-teller.

703
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,320
You lost so much weight.

704
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,040
I hope drinking this will help you regain your energy.

705
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,920
It's already giving me a lot of strength since you made it for me.

706
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,840
Where did you go without even saying anything?

707
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,760
- I got a job. - You got a job?

708
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
Here.

709
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,760
What's this?

710
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,720
I'm an insurance planner now.

711
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,120
I got a license for that when I used to be the CEO of Royeol Insurance.

712
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,560
I'm a freelance insurance planner.

713
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,960
I have flexible working hours, and I get paid solely based on my results.

714
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,080
But I have great talking skills, and I'm very good looking.

715
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,840
I also look good in this suit.

716
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,440
Why did you suddenly become an insurance planner?

717
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,080
My dad also started out as an insurance agent.

718
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,560
I'm going to achieve everything step by step...

719
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,040
just like my dad.

720
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,920
You just watch. I'm going to become the most popular insurance planner.

721
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,280
Then in the future,

722
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,080
I'm going to build a company as big as Royeol Insurance.

723
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,120
How's your father doing?

724
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,960
He's become a lot better.

725
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,080
That's a relief.

726
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,160
My dad became like that...

727
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,840
because of me.

728
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,080
What?

729
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,800
- Why? - My family used to...

730
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,600
treat me like I didn't even exist.

731
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,760
My only friend was Sip Gyeon and my computer.

732
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,360
But as I grew older, I wanted to let my family know that I existed.

733
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,160
I was too immature back then.

734
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,800
I thought they'd acknowledge my existence...

735
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,360
if I got myself in trouble.

736
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,480
I thought that would grab their attention.

737
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,720
So I hacked into Royeol Group's security system.

738
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,720
Then my older brother sued me.

739
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,760
My dad even begged my brother on his knees, but it was useless.

740
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,320
I became an ex-convict because of that,

741
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,520
so my dad got shocked and collapsed.

742
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,400
He's been bedridden ever since.

743
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,840
Leo! Leo!

744
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,400
- Hey, what's wrong? - He surprised me.

745
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,960
- Hey! Leo! - He suddenly fainted.

746
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,560
- Here. - Thank you.

747
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,600
Leo, wake up! Leo, wake up.

748
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,480
Wake up.

749
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,240
I should've killed him back then.

750
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,080
Excuse me.

751
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,560
Okay.

752
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,200
Leo, how do you feel?

753
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,200
You're going to be shooting soon. You should take care of your health.

754
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,800
I saw the main concept and ending of this drama somewhere else.

755
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,400
What are you talking about?

756
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,160
("Mouse")

757
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,520
You know what that is, right?

758
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,480
It's just a coincidence.

759
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,200
There are so many similar stories these days.

760
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,720
You practically copied the entire thing.

761
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,400
All you did is change the genre.

762
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,480
Don't worry. We just used the main concept. That's not plagiarism.

763
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,680
Then what about the writer?

764
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,080
Don't worry about her.

765
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,240
We spread rumors that she's insane.

766
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,680
So no one's going to believe what she says.

767
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,800
What a bunch of thieves.

768
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,600
You'd rather be better off stealing something.

769
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,920
You little jerk.

770
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,520
You're not even a great actor.

771
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,000
You have nothing to be proud of apart from your pretty face.

772
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,840
- You piece of trash. - My gosh, stop!

773
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,600
That's enough. He's a patient. Please let go of him.

774
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,160
- Let me go. - I said, let go of him.

775
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,280
- You jerk. - Let me go!

776
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,360
You punk.

777
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,440
(You'll end up regretting your past deeds to the bone.)

778
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,840
(I'll make you fall into the fiery pit, so brace yourself.)

779
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,800
What?

780
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,000
Is there someone else other than me who's after Leo?

781
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,640
Is it a stalker?

782
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,400
This might make things easier for me.

783
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,600
Oh Man Ho, you must've hid it well.

784
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,800
I'm sure there's evidence to prove that he got bribed.

785
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,080
Please find a document for me.

786
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,800
It's a document under Chunsu Insurance from 20 years ago.

787
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,840
What?

788
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,720
They said they didn't have any documents from 1997.

789
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
That means they got rid of it.

790
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,920
Chunsu Insurance's written documents are kept in the storage room.

791
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,240
So the files from 1997 could still be there.

792
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,160
Yes, that's right. Mr. Hwang told me that the documents from 1997...

793
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,200
are still kept in the storage room.

794
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,960
Hello, Mr. Hwang. It's me, Oh Man Soo.

795
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,720
Leo!

796
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,600
What happened to your face? Did you have a fight or something?

797
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,640
No, it's nothing.

798
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,520
I'll also be in Director Shin's drama.

799
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,240
As soon as I heard that you'd be my co-star,

800
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,280
I signed the contract without even negotiating my pay.

801
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,000
You'll be the female lead?

802
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,040
How did you get that role?

803
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,480
Did you find yourself a backer or what?

804
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,520
Don't call him like that.

805
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,400
He's my lover.

806
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,200
Shall I tell you who it is?

807
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,720
He's...

808
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,240
Gosh. What was that about?

809
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,440
I'll see you at the read-through.

810
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,760
Goodness.

811
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,000
- Hey. - Hey, where are you now?

812
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,880
The CEO is outraged right now.

813
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,440
Come home immediately.

814
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,800
You called a chauffeur, right?

815
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,160
Of course.

816
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,840
He's coming as fast as he can at the moment.

817
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,360
What? Is he already here?

818
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,120
Oh, this is Mi So's car.

819
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,400
Your car is parked over there.

820
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,840
I got confused because she has the exact same car.

Oh, right.

849

You asked me for the documents from 1997 stored in the warehouse.

I need to look into something.

00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,120
You haven't told anyone about this, right?

855

Gosh, of course not.

856
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,240
All the documents from Chunsu Insurance...

857
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,640
are missing data from 1997.

858

Do you know anything about it?

859
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,920
I think that's when things started happening for Chunsu Insurance.

860
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,760
Even just reminiscing that time puts me in a great mood.

861
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,720
That was my second year at the company,

862
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,880
but I got a lot of bonus that year.

863
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,720
What position did my brother have back then?

864
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,080
He and I joined the company in the same year.

865
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,000
Oh, right. Was it that summer?

866
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,760
He got promoted to the director position.

867
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,080
I think that's when Mr. Vice President started...

868
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,600
making all the important decisions.

869
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,680
He's been the one holding the reign since then.

870

Oh, really?

871
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,120
Mr. President told us in the past...

872
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,080
that he'd make his sons...

873

work just like us normal employees.

874
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,840
But he changed his words in less than two years after saying that,

875
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,160
so all of us were very flustered.

Gosh, what is this mess?

880

Something must've happened in 1997.

881

- The chauffeur is here. - Okay.

977

I went there because I got a call,

978
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
but when I arrived, the car was gone.

979

- What? - The car already left.

980
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,440
It's not him. It was someone else.

This is Mi So's car.

984
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,920
Your car is over there.

985
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,400
I was confused because it's the same car.

986
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,760
He was wearing a black cap.

987
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,680
A black cap.

988
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,640
His hand was bandaged. Did you see his face?

989
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,360
It was too dark.

990
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,400
Is that so?

991
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,720
On his face...

992
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,680
Are you okay?

993
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,320
I'm sorry.

994
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,280
I'm sorry.

995
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,080
Don't try to change people's fate carelessly.

996
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,440
He had a scar on the face.

997
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,760
- A scar? - On his right cheek.

998
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,200
(You will regret what you've done.)

999
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,240
What do you mean?

1000
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,440
You won't be able to bear the consequence.

1001
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,520
Remember what I said.

1002
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,520
What was that? How uncomfortable.

1003
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,680
Do you remember anything else?

1004
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,560
It was him.

1005
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,880
Who do you mean?

1006
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,880
It's the same way that he killed the woman.

1007
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,960
Actress Lee Mi So was found dead in her car.

1008
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,400
According to a witness, the suspect's hand was bandaged.

1009
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,440
- Lee Mi So? - He has a scar on his face.

1010
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,360
A scar?

1011
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,720
What happened?

1012
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,320
No way.

1013
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,640
Many people have scars on their faces.

1014
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,440
Don't try to change people's fate carelessly.

1015
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,920
Remember what I said.

1016
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,760
You won't be able to bear the consequence.

1017
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,600
It can't be him.

1018
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,120
(The suspect is presumed to have a scar on his face.)

1019
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,800
A scar?

1020
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,160
Long time no see, Kim Sun Young.

1021
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,480
Help me over here. Over here!

1022
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,320
- Are you okay? - There are children inside.

1023
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,440
Get out of the way.

1024
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,640
No. No.

1025
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,360
I'll kill you.

1026
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,200
I'll kill you.

1027
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,720
Which woman are you talking about?

1028
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,200
Who do you mean?

1029
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,080
Do you mean Han Jin Sook?

1030
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,040
No.

1031
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,840
The director of the mental hospital.

1032
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,560
Be quiet.

1033
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,840
Be quiet.

1034
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,840
Be quiet!

1035
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,360
I told you to be quiet.

1036
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,800
Be quiet!

1037
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,800
He enjoys killing people.

1038
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,720
(Black)

1039
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,720
He has a scar on his face. It's him.

1040
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,160
He could be killing someone else right now.

1041
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,560
It was done by that doctor.

1042
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,600
No way.

1043
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,520
We could have stopped it if we found out sooner.

1044
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,840
Moo Gang isn't Joon.

1045
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,279
That can't be.

1046
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,359
If you continue, you might die.

1047
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:22,760
My Joon.

1048
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,600
Is he really dead?
