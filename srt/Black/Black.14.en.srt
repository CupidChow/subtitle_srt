00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,120
(Episode 14)

2
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,320
Ha Ram.

3
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm sorry that I came too late.

5
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,120
Ha Ram.

6
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,840
Ha Ram, are you okay?

7
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,880
Ha Ram.

8
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,160
Get off me! Go away. Who are you?

9
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,240
Go away. Get lost!

10
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Ha Ram.

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
No.

12
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,720
- Ha Ram. - No, no.

13
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,640
No, no, no.

14
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,320
Just kill me. Don't kill anyone else.

15
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,720
Kill only me. Don't kill anyone but me, you jerk.

16
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,560
They have nothing to do with it.

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,760
Is she talking about her boss?

18
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,040
So what on earth does that mean?

19
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,480
Simply put, the blood on the scene was from two people.

20
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,320
So that means that the 2L of blood was from 2 people combined, right?

21
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,960
No. No...

22
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,280
No!

23
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,360
Who is this punk?

24
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,760
Run away! Now!

25
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
No.

26
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,040
No, no!

27
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,880
No. No, Boss!

28
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,840
No. No, Boss.

29
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
Die.

30
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,200
No!

31
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,800
- You're seriously injured. - Are we there yet?

32
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,160
Hang in there.

33
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,440
Sit down here for a minute.

34
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,760
Are you okay? Are you all right? Please keep yourself together.

35
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,000
You should lie down on the hay here.

36
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,760
Lie down here for a moment. My goodness.

37
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,200
Boss.

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
Please hang in there.

39
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,320
My phone doesn't even work here.

40
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,200
No...

41
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,520
Your dad told me...

42
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,200
that the safest way to protect yourself when you're in danger...

43
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
is locking yourself up so that your enemy can't get to you.

44
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
No.

45
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
No. Stop. Please stop.

46
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,480
Since there are two of you,

47
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,040
you guys won't be lonely when you die.

48
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
Enjoy the pain.

49
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,320
No. The key. The key.

50
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,320
The key.

51
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,680
My key.

52
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,520
Call Mr. Oh.

53
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
Call his younger children too.

54
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,440
Yes, Doctor.

55
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,880
Doctor, we just got a call from the ER.

56
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,480
Has Moo Gang arrived? Is he severely injured?

57
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,520
No, Mr. Oh's brother is being transferred here in an ambulance.

58
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,840
He got stabbed in the chest. He's in critical condition.

59
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
What?

60
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,280
- Arrange an operating room now. - Okay.

61
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
The portable chest X-ray too.

62
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,440
- Got it. - Yes, Doctor.

63
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
Please hang in there.

64
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,760
Boss.

65
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,240
Please hurry. Boss, wake up.

66
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
Boss, please open your eyes.

67
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,640
What?

68
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
He didn't die?

69
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,560
Boss, Boss.

70
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,760
- My gosh... - You cannot go in.

71
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,480
- Let go. Let go of me. - He needs to be treated right away.

72
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,159
- Please calm down. - Let me in for a minute.

73
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
(Operating Room)

74
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
The scene has been cleared.

75
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,440
Some people got injured, but luckily, no injuries are critical.

76
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,760
Yes, Moo Gang is here.

77
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,640
All right. Okay.

78
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Gosh, look at all the blood.

79
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you okay? I heard about what happened to Ha Ram.

80
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,720
Hey, I'm so relieved. I was really worried.

81
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,000
Inspector Choi, that quack. Seriously.

82
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,000
Hey, Moo Gang. Where are you going?

83
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,720
Doctor. Doctor, please save him.

84
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,520
It's because of me. It happened because of me.

85
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,840
I'll do my best. You need to get treated yourself.

86
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,320
Treat her now.

87
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,040
Doctor.

88
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,400
Doctor. Doctor...

89
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,600
She's not dead?

90
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,120
Moo Gang. Are you all right?

91
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,000
You didn't get treatment. Where are you going?

92
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,320
Come here now.

93
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,680
I need to ask you for something.

94
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,960
Please.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,240
Please save him.

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,160
Please.

97
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,320
You should wear these.

98
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,200
Your wound is probably being infected now.

99
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
You'll be in trouble unless you get treatment now.

100
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,240
Let's go.

101
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,200
I'll stay here until the operation is finished.

102
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,120
I heard that he got hurt while he was saving you.

103
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
You must be very sorry.

104
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
You must be very distressed.

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
It was the same with me.

106
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
When I was young,

107
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,600
there was this boy who liked me very much.

108
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,000
And one day,

109
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,720
he came to save me,

110
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,640
he tried to save me,

111
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
and he died.

112
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,680
Joon... Joon.

113
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,240
Joon.

114
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,520
Joon!

115
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,560
No!

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
I felt guilty for his death,

117
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,880
so I wanted to die every day.

118
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
I tried hanging myself,

119
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
throwing myself off somewhere high,

120
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,720
and even falling into a river.

121
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
But every time I tried,

122
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,720
I thought that would make...

123
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,000
the boy's death meaningless.

124
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,840
Such thoughts held me back.

125
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,360
It might have been just an excuse.

126
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,840
However, I earned my life at the cost of his death.

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,200
I thought I should not easily let go of my life.

128
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,800
That must be why I've tried so hard to live my life.

129
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,400
Oh Man Soo gave up on his life for you, Ha Ram.

130
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Are you going to die just because of an infection?

131
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,320
Then what would become of Mr. Oh who gave up on his life for you?

132
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,840
When he wakes up,

133
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,640
you should be waiting for him in a healthy condition.

134
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,360
I did what you asked me to do, so you should keep your promise too.

135
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm sorry, Moo Gang.

136
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,680
I shouldn't have wanted to have you in the first place.

137
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,680
What? Hey, Moo Gang!

138
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,920
Why did you leave the ambulance so suddenly like that?

139
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,960
I've been looking for you.

140
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,520
How did you know that Wang Young Choon...

141
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,720
would come to this hospital and come here?

142
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,960
You seem to know many things alone.

143
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,200
How did you know?

144
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,400
Hey, how did you know?

145
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,080
He was after that rude one.

146
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
That rude one?

147
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,600
Is there anyone else except you?

148
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,760
It's Leo.

149
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
Wang Young Choon's next target was Leo.

150
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,080
There was a blackmail letter aiming for Leo at his hideout.

151
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
His hideout?

152
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,520
Was it Wang Young Choon's hideout?

153
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,320
Ha Ram!

154
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,280
You're alive.

155
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,560
Have you got hurt much? Are you all right?

156
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,840
Why are you doing this?

157
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Since when did you pay attention to me?

158
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,880
All right.

159
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,760
It's enough if you are alive.

160
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,840
It's enough.

161
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
Honey.

162
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,400
You protected Ha Ram, right?

163
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,480
Thank you.

164
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Where is it?

165
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,600
Ready your arms.

166
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,080
That crazy jerk. He killed people again.

167
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,000
Call them quickly.

168
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,080
Yes, Inspector Choi. You should come here now. Yes.

169
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,120
It's Leo.

170
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,480
Wang Young Choon's next target was Leo.

171
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,480
There was a blackmail letter aiming for Leo at his hideout.

172
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,240
Doctor.

173
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,920
What happened to Mr. Oh?

174
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,760
For now, he passed the crisis.

175
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,560
But we will need to observe his progress.

176
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,160
Is he all right?

177
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,000
He didn't die, did he?

178
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,160
Thank you.

179
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,920
Thank you, Doctor.

180
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,240
(Royeol Hospital)

181
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
See if I'm dying.

182
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,840
Do you see any shadows?

183
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,720
I don't see any.

184
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,960
You're not going to die.

185
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,760
You're lying.

186
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,160
You said that you can't see it in the dark.

187
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,600
That's...

188
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,800
This is unfair.

189
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,680
I haven't confessed my love for my entire life.

190
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,960
What?

191
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,440
I'll do it before I die.

192
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,840
Ms. Fortune-teller.

193
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,480
Would you date me?

194
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
Until I die.

195
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Just until I die.

196
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,359
Be my girlfriend.

197
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,920
I don't want to be a bachelor ghost after I die.

198
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,319
Mr. Oh.

199
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,920
You will not die. You will never die.

200
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,200
- What bachelor ghost... - I...

201
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
really like you, Ha Ram.

202
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,480
All right. We'll shoot the next scene now.

203
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,040
Excuse me.

204
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,200
- Over there. - There he is.

205
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,880
Hello. We know how busy you are. Sorry to bother you.

206
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,560
Well... Here.

207
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,360
Have you seen him before?

208
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
This man.

209
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,520
Is he the person who tried to kill me?

210
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,360
Yes. You don't know him at all?

211
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,800
No, I don't. If I have known him,

212
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,520
I would've recognized him when Mi So died.

213
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,200
Right, I see.

214
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,960
Did anything out of ordinary happen on the set at Royeol Hospital?

215
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
Nothing really happened...

216
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, I was trying to get some sleep while waiting for my next call...

217
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,800
Please move to the next room. I need to use this room.

218
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,760
So I moved to the room next to it and took a nap.

219
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Was he one of the hospital staff? Do you remember what he looked like?

220
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,840
- No, I don't. - By any chance,

221
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,800
did you receive any blackmail letters?

222
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,080
Detective Han told me so.

223
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,880
Oh, I gave him the blackmail letter.

224
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,000
And we received another recently. I have it on me now.

225
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Here.

226
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,880
This must be it.

227
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,400
All right. Thank you.

228
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,840
- Thank you. - No problem.

229
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,920
- Detective Park. - Yes, sir.

230
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,720
Find out if Lee Mi So also received blackmail letters like this.

231
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,440
And investigate every single person that was close to her, okay?

232
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,720
All right. Got it.

233
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,640
Oh, do you have any connections to Moojin by any chance?

234
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,920
In your childhood, perhaps?

235
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,760
- Moojin? - Yes.

236
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,040
No, I spent my entire childhood in the US.

237
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,560
I see. Thank you.

238
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,360
Please contact us if you remember anything else.

239
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,000
- Have a good day. - You too.

240
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,160
Hey, didn't you say that you lived in Moojin for a while as a kid?

241
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,120
What? Me?

242
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,360
- Am I wrong? - I never did.

243
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,160
Let me summarize it.

244
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,000
On April 19th, 1997 in Moojin,

245
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,280
Han Moo Gang's brother, Kim Joon, witnessed something...

246
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,880
on the day that Clara, Pumpkin Singer's madam,

247
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,920
Han Jin Sook, and Kim Sun Young went missing.

248
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,440
Then he died in a hit-and-run accident early the next morning.

249
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,240
According to Moo Gang, this jerk ordered Wang Young Choon...

250
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,080
to kill the madam of Pumpkin Singer,

251
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,920
but he didn't kill Kim Joon.

252
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,720
That's right. Moo Gang heard it directly from Wang Young Choon.

253
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,760
Apparently, he was told to find some kind of tape,

254
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,680
and he ended up killing her when he went to get it.

255
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,480
Right, that's how he ended up killing the madam,

256
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,080
but his sister-in-law, her husband, and the director of the asylum...

257
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,520
kept him locked up for 20 years,

258
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,920
so he killed them as well...

259
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,360
to get his revenge. That's what happened, right?

260
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Yes.

261
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
What about the bodies that were found at his hideout?

262
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,040
Oh, right. We've identified the bodies.

263
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,760
They were his sister-in-law's ex-husband and his current wife.

264
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,760
The butcher shop is also under his sister-in-law's ex-husband.

265
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,000
It looks like he killed the couple after killing the director...

266
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,680
and has been using that place as his hideout since then.

267
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,400
All right. His sister-in-law and the director of the hospital...

268
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,160
kept him locked up and took the insurance payout from him,

269
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,280
so let's say that he killed them to get back at them.

270
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,680
But he was targeting Leo too.

271
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,480
Doesn't it mean that killing Lee Mi So wasn't a random act either?

272
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,760
Wang Young Choon didn't hold any grudges against Leo or Lee Mi So.

273
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,880
I wonder if Lee Mi So also received a letter like this.

274
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,360
I already asked Detective Park to look into it.

275
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
- Good. - Hey.

276
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,680
There he is. Hey, did you find out anything?

277
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,280
There was no letter,

278
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,280
but I think she had a backer.

279
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,680
- What? - A backer? Who?

280
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,680
According to the rumors, they say it's Oh Man Ho of Royeol Group.

281
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,400
She was a rookie, you know.

282
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,520
But Oh Man Ho chose her as the face of the Royeol brand...

283
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,000
even though all the executives were against it.

284
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,200
Many people saw them dining together after that happened.

285
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,800
He doesn't live with his wife at the moment.

286
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,400
She's in the US now.

287
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,440
See? All the pieces are coming together now.

288
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,040
It's Oh Man Ho.

289
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,440
Then what about Leo?

290
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,920
There's no connection between the two.

291
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,080
No, there must be something between Leo and Oh Man Ho.

292
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,920
Let's find out what it is.

293
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,360
What is this?

294
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
The chairman of Royeol Group died.

295
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
- What? - What?

296
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,960
Stop shaking your hands.

297
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
(Han Moo Gang's mom)

298
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,560
What's wrong?

299
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,120
Chairman Oh Chun Su of Royeol Group passed away...

300
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,400
around 3pm this afternoon after battling a long-term illness.

301
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
According to Royeol Group's statement, the cause of death...

302
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,840
- was respiratory failure... - What?

303
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,720
due to cardiac insufficiency.

304
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,080
- Boss' father passed away? - He's been hospitalized since...

305
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,480
- No way. That can't be. - his heart attack seven years ago.

306
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,840
- His funeral will take place at... - When I checked again,

307
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
the shadow was gone.

308
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,880
Excuse me.

309
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,440
Which ward was Chairman Oh Chun Su in on the fifth?

310
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,600
Just a moment, please.

311
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,240
He was in Room 2021.

312
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,960
On the 20th floor?

313
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,920
He was on the 19th floor before.

314
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Oh, his condition suddenly worsened,

315
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,800
so we moved him to the ICU on the 20th floor.

316
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,200
What... Who are you?

317
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,160
Hey, what are you doing here? This is my boss' father's room.

318
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,720
Well...

319
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,280
It was my fault.

320
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,120
Then...

321
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,760
what I've seen wasn't Boss' father?

322
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,520
Was it that punk, Oh Sang Min?

323
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,440
I was confused with those two.

324
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,040
Because of my mistake,

325
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,480
I couldn't prevent it.

326
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,920
Chairman Oh was holding it tightly...

327
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,560
when he passed away.

328
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,960
Well, this looks like a key of some sort to a safe.

329
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,680
Why are you giving it to me?

330
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,440
I thought hard about it and...

331
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,680
Please let it all go and leave already for the sake of Royeol.

332
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,760
I'll make sure to hold a grand funeral for you.

333
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,360
That's why I thought I shouldn't give it to Mr. Oh straight away.

334
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,160
Even Chairman Oh's youngest son is seriously injured at the moment.

335
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,560
Please check it. If there's no problem...

336
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,400
Wait, he said that to his own dad?

337
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,960
My goodness.

338
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,240
All right. I'll find out what this key is for...

339
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,320
and return it to the bereaved afterward. Goodbye.

340
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,440
Wait. I heard that Moo Gang...

341
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,960
got a sick leave.

342
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,600
He's not cut out to be a detective, and he keeps causing trouble.

343
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,680
I'd appreciate it if he could just leave the force.

344
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,640
Well, that's not something I have the authority to do so.

345
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,040
The higher-ups control all HR matters. Take care then.

346
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,720
But Detective Han...

347
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,440
is actually not as incompetent as you think he is.

348
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,080
He's more knowledgeable than anyone else as a detective,

349
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,160
and he's great at what he does.

350
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,000
Goodbye.

351
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,120
Even Boss almost died because of me,

352
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,160
and his father died because of my mistake.

353
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,920
If I hadn't been confused that day...

354
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,320
It's odd though.

355
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,280
Woo Byung Sik is really dead now. Why did he pass away?

356
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,440
I certainly saw the butterfly watch on that wrist.

357
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,760
Oh, Mr. Oh Man Soo regained his consciousness.

358
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,840
Pardon?

359
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
Thank you.

360
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,880
Boss, are you all right?

361
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,920
Thank goodness. I'm so relieved.

362
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,200
Has he been caught yet?

363
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,120
What should I tell him?

364
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,880
He'll be shocked if I tell him about his father's death.

365
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,480
Oh, right.

366
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,720
I've been so out of it.

367
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,080
Just a moment. I'll find out what happened quickly.

368
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,120
What happened?

369
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,960
With what?

370
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,440
That scoundrel who killed my dad. Did you catch him?

371
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,760
He died.

372
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,360
He died?

373
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,760
How am I supposed to believe you?

374
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
You lie every time you open your mouth.

375
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,600
Then go there, and see it for yourself.

376
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,360
You jerk. Why did you do that?

377
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,280
Why did you do that?

378
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,200
Why on earth did you kill my dad? Why?

379
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,680
My dad didn't do anything wrong to you.

380
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,680
If only they believed what I said back then.

381
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,600
If they only believed me...

382
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,720
saying that the man with a spider tattoo killed my dad.

383
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,600
Then things would not have turned out like this.

384
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
It's not my fault.

385
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,160
It's not my fault.

386
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,120
A spider tattoo?

387
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,600
The man, who killed my dad, is there!

388
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,000
Who is it?

389
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,680
Is she...

390
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,560
Mr. Kang's daughter?

391
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,680
He's dead after all.

392
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,360
It's a relief...

393
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,240
that he paid for what he did wrong at least now.

394
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,520
It's all because of me.

395
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,120
Those who died...

396
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,840
and what has happened to you.

397
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,440
Don't think of it that way.

398
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
You couldn't help it.

399
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,640
(Royeol Hospital)

400
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,800
(After several days)

401
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,560
Are you all right?

402
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,000
Gosh. I'll get you some water.

403
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,160
Okay.

404
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,400
Until I die.

405
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,880
Just until I die.

406
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,480
Be my girlfriend.

407
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,920
I don't want to be a bachelor ghost after I die.

408
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,520
Gosh, this is driving me crazy. I'm so ashamed of myself.

409
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,080
By the way, how did you know and come to me back then?

410
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,360
Well, I tracked your location.

411
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,480
You rushed out like that, and I went after you right away.

412
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,000
But you were already gone.

413
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,480
How could I not be worried about you? So...

414
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Why did you come at the murderer like that?

415
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,240
What about you, Ms. Fortune-teller?

416
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,760
When I saw you lying down after being stabbed by him,

417
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,240
I just lost my mind at that moment.

418
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,520
I'll go home and get changed.

419
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,000
No, you should take some rest. I'm fine.

420
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,280
You haven't been at home for several days because of me.

421
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,640
I can move by myself now. I'm fine.

422
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,800
I can call a caregiver.

423
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,320
I'll just get changed and come back soon.

424
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,280
Wait.

425
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
Well, you know...

426
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,480
On that day when we were locked up,

427
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,160
I don't remember anything, so...

428
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,800
I didn't...

429
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,000
say anything silly, did I?

430
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,840
I really don't remember...

431
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,000
anything at all, you know.

432
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,120
I was out of my mind that day myself.

433
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,200
You're right. You don't remember...

434
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,040
You're right.

435
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,720
We were both so close to death. We can't remember anything, right?

436
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Take some rest. I'll be back soon.

437
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
I'm relieved. She can't remember anything.

438
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,480
Why won't she save her?

439
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,320
You're thinking about it again.

440
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,560
He looks so serious.

441
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,360
He must have something on his mind.

442
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,720
What are you doing now?

443
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,600
What are you thinking?

444
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,560
You shouldn't do it. If you kill a human, you'll cease to exist.

445
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,600
Do you want to disappear forever?

446
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,640
Yes.

447
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,360
But he still saved Ha Ram.

448
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,360
I'm very worried.

449
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,720
Hurry.

450
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,560
Bring her quickly now.

451
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,120
Welcome...

452
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,520
I called the fast dial number saved as zero on his phone.

453
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,200
Okay.

454
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,960
- Thank you. - Thank you.

455
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,680
You must be Kang Ha Ram.

456
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,080
He kept calling your name.

457
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,000
It seems like you two had a fight. Why don't you make up?

458
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,000
He seems to love you very much.

459
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,400
- Moo Gang, wake up. Let's go. - What?

460
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,639
- Wait just a second. - Let's go.

461
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,120
Let's go.

462
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,880
Let's go, Moo Gang.

463
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,800
Gosh, that punk. Seriously.

464
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,680
Gosh, why is he sleeping here?

465
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,400
Hey, wake up. Gosh, he stinks of alcohol.

466
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,320
- Is he intoxicated? - Yes, sir.

467
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,000
Wake up, you jerk! You should go home!

468
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
Hey.

469
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,920
Have some of this, would you?

470
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Hey.

471
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,200
You should eat, you punk!

472
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,400
How is it? It's terrific, isn't it?

473
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,560
I've been making this hangover soup for 20 years.

474
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,320
What's wrong with me?

475
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,880
Why am I doing this?

476
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,640
You held on to a car and got shot by a gun because of that girl.

477
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,480
You did all those crazy things, and you still don't know why?

478
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Are you an idiot?

479
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,200
It's love. What else would it be, you punk?

480
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
What?

481
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,080
Love... Love?

482
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,960
What's with you really? Haven't you fallen in love before?

483
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,680
What's with you really? Haven't you fallen in love before?

484
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,760
Did you just say...

485
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,400
that this is love?

486
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,640
Yes, you nerd.

487
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
Who on earth is she?

488
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,480
Is there any reason for you to not be able to tell me?

489
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,040
She's not a married woman, right?

490
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,320
No way.

491
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,880
Then what's the problem?

492
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Gwang Gyun.

493
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,160
Someone you love...

494
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,800
might not stay with you for as long as you think.

495
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,160
So, don't waste your time.

496
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,040
Don't think about anything else.

497
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,920
Be true to how you feel.

498
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,480
It was the same with me.

499
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,720
Even though my wife left me,

500
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,120
I loved her.

501
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
I never regret that.

502
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,320
Because of that,

503
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,200
I really loved her very much.

504
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,880
Just like him,

505
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,280
I never regret having loved her either.

506
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,560
I don't care...

507
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,960
what kind of person she was.

508
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,520
I'm going to go now.

509
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,520
You can do the dishes.

510
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,480
Isn't it too cold outside? Do you want to go back inside?

511
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,920
Let's stay outside a little longer. It's nice to feel the breeze.

512
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,440
You should keep yourself warm. There you go.

513
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,040
Ha Ram.

514
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,120
To be honest,

515
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,280
I like you.

516
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,200
You remember what I said to you...

517
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,920
about how I feel, don't you?

518
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
I really...

519
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,840
meant what I said.

520
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm...

521
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,320
really grateful for what you did for me.

522
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,640
If it weren't for you,

523
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,560
I would've been dead already.

524
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
But...

525
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,520
I don't feel the same way about you.

526
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,000
Is it because of Detective Han?

527
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,840
No, that's not...

528
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,360
That's not the reason.

529
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,000
You should think about it carefully.

530
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,240
Are you sure that's not why?

531
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Did you like him because you thought he was Joon?

532
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,080
Or did you like him for who he was?

533
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,960
My gosh, this is embarrassing.

534
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,640
This is why people shouldn't confess their feelings when they're sober.

535
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,480
But...

536
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,000
we can still stay friends...

537
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,600
like we were before, right?

538
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,160
Of course.

539
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,120
Thank you, Mr. Oh.

540
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,440
Let's go now.

541
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,000
- This. - Yes, that's the one.

542
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,680
It's the key to our bank's VIP customers' secret vault.

543
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,800
"Secret vault"?

544
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,880
Yes, that's right.

545
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,280
Then can you please open this? I need it for an investigation.

546
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,480
Only Chairman Oh Chun Su can have access to his vault.

547
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,320
But he's dead!

548
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,840
Wait a second.

549
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,360
He assigned Mr. Oh Man Soo as his proxy in case of his death.

550
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,120
Mr. Oh Man Soo needs to come here himself in order to have access.

551
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
And you should...

552
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,640
- Detective Na. - Oh, hey.

553
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,120
Hello. We meet again.

554
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm sorry, but I need to have a word with him.

555
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,160
Okay. I'll buy you guys some drinks.

556
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,080
Would you like anything?

557
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,080
Oh, sure. I'd like something refreshing.

558
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,160
- I'd like an iced peppermint drink. - Okay.

559
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,120
- What brings you here? - Oh, well...

560
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,640
- You can sit comfortably. - No, it's okay.

561
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,240
Have you ever seen this butterfly watch before?

562
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,480
No, I've never seen this before.

563
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,280
Have you ever seen any of your father's acquaintances...

564
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,040
wearing a butterfly watch?

565
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,080
No way. It can't be that watch.

566
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,400
I've never seen this before. But why do you ask?

567
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,120
It's okay. Never mind.

568
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,800
Then...

569
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,080
Have you ever seen this key?

570
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,040
I gave this key...

571
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,520
to my dad because he asked me to bring it from home.

572
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,440
Why do you have this?

573
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,560
Well, about that.

574
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,080
Your father asked me to come to see him and said that he had...

575
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,120
something very important to tell me.

576
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,360
But he died shortly after he called.

577
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,120
- What? - So I'm guessing...

578
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,760
whatever's inside this vault will have something to do with...

579
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,560
what he was trying to tell me.

580
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,280
And you were assigned as the owner of this key in case of his death.

581
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm sorry. This is...

582
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,240
What... What are you talking about? My dad passed away?

583
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,560
My gosh, never mind. I'm really sorry.

584
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,640
I'm sure you're shocked, but I just had to do my work.

585
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,080
Wait. Mr. Oh Man Soo.

586
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,920
Hello, doctor. You're in charge of treating Mr. Oh Man Soo, aren't you?

587
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,720
Yes, that's right.

588
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,400
You seem really tired. You should drink some coffee.

589
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,600
Oh, thank you. I was getting sleepy.

590
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,680
This... This isn't coffee.

591
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,960
Oh, I'm sorry. I must've confused it with peppermint tea.

592
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,560
My gosh, I'm allergic to peppermint.

593
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,040
- I'm sorry. - Seriously.

594
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,480
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

595
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,000
- Ms. Fortune-teller. - We're all ready.

596
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,640
You said my dad wasn't going to die.

597
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
You knew about this all along, didn't you?

598
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,880
You said you couldn't see my dad's shadow anymore.

599
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,520
But why did he die? Why?

600
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,520
- Mr. Oh. - Dad.

601
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,920
- I'm sorry. - I can't believe my dad died.

602
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,360
Dad. Dad.

603
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,680
Mr. Oh.

604
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,080
I'm sorry.

605
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,240
Dad.

606
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,200
(Oh Chun Su)

607
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,480
The person I checked last time must've been your nephew,

608
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,040
not your father.

609
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,440
I didn't know your brother had moved him to another floor.

610
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm really sorry.

611
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,920
I should've looked more carefully.

612
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,880
It's not your fault.

613
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,000
The shadow you foresaw...

614
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,520
You saw Woo Byung Sik wearing a butterfly watch...

615
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,360
and killing my dad.

616
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,880
But Woo Byung Sik...

617
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,600
had already died way before my dad passed away.

618
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,360
That means...

619
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,600
my dad died of a cardiac arrest.

620
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,280
That's what the doctor said.

621
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,720
Even if you had seen my dad's shadow that day,

622
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,680
there's no way we would've been able to save him.

623
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,560
You should go home first.

624
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,800
I have somewhere to go with Detective Na.

625
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,960
I'm in love?

626
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,040
I'm 444.

627
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,760
And he thinks I'm in love with a human?

628
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,080
Does this even make sense?

629
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,360
No, it doesn't.

630
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,760
You're the infamous 444. You're known to be coldhearted.

631
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,840
Don't you agree?

632
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,160
Of course.

633
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,520
He would never like a good-for-nothing human.

634
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,880
Exactly.

635
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I guess he's saying crazy stuff because he's a crazy dog himself.

636
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,120
Crazy Dog doesn't know...

637
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,440
that what I need is Ha Ram's eyes, not Ha Ram herself.

638
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,160
If he knew that, he wouldn't have babbled on about love.

639
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,480
He always makes the same excuse.

640
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,520
All of this...

641
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,280
is because of that loser.

642
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,760
I wouldn't be in this situation if he hadn't run away.

643
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,920
I don't love anyone.

644
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,040
I can't believe he thinks I'm in love with a mere human.

645
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,560
My goodness.

646
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,480
It seems serious. He keeps saying the same thing over and over again.

647
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,240
Love?

648
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,320
This makes no sense.

649
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,800
Love? My gosh.

650
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
I'm 444. I would never fall in love with a mere human.

651
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,840
My gosh. That makes no sense.

652
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,840
I can't keep doing this.

653
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,800
What's this?

654
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,760
What?

655
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,400
Wang Young Choon...

656
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,600
is the one who killed Clara?

657
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,040
Yes, he told me himself.

658
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,960
He was told to find the videotape. That's why he went to see her.

659
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,280
But he ended up killing her without being able to find the videotape.

660
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,400
Could this be...

661
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,720
I'll call you as soon as I check what this is.

662
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,520
Wait. Detective Na.

663
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,840
What was that about?

664
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,000
What?

665
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,080
It wasn't Oh Man Ho?

666
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,320
Oh Chun Su...

667
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,040
Who chose you?

668
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,200
Who's the guy behind all this?

669
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,000
Did you take this videotape yourself?

670
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,760
Yes, I interviewed her.

671
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,520
I got a report saying that...

672
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,160
a certain bar was using minors for prostitution.

673
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,480
I headed straight to the bar to check.

674
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,760
But I guess it was too early because no one was there.

675
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
Is anyone here?

676
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,800
Hello? Is anyone here?

677
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,840
Hello? Is anyone here?

678
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,760
Who are you?

679
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,640
She seemed very scared of the sex traffickers.

680
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,840
It seemed like they had already threatened her a lot.

681
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,040
I'll make sure they can never do something like that again.

682
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,360
But in order to do that, you need to tell me everything.

683
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,520
You're my one and only witness.

684
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,560
Are you serious?

685
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,480
But...

686
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,920
I know what you're worried about.

687
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,040
I'm going to modulate your voice and blur you out.

688
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,400
I'm also going to ask the police to take you into protective custody.

689
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,800
I'm going to check until I'm sure of everything.

690
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,160
I'll only release the video then. Is that okay with you?

691
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,240
There's a camera over there,

692
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,440
so let's just do the interview here, okay?

693
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,040
But...

694
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,880
why is there a camera at a pub?

695
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:39,240
Apparently, he asked for a video to check if I'm a minor or not.

696
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,320
He also asked for my identification card.

697
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,960
That jerk.

698
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,640
I was worried that she might have a change of heart...

699
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,400
if I asked her to meet another time.

700
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,360
So I asked her to use the camera at that spot to record everything.

701
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,600
I'll leave out your face and shoot from your neck and downwards.

702
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,880
Is it true that you were involved in prostitution?

703
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,080
Yes.

704
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,920
Were you forced against your will?

705
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,680
At first,

706
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,040
the madam of the pub suggested it to me.

707
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,400
She said someone specifically asked for me.

708
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,920
She said that he'll let me go to university...

709
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,640
and that he'll let me achieve my dream.

710
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,240
She said I only had to do it once.

711
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,200
I told her that I didn't want to do it anymore.

712
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,760
I said I wanted to stop.

713
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,040
I'm sorry. Please save me. Please help.

714
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,520
Please save me.

715
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,440
- Please help me. - Stand up.

716
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

717
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,800
It wasn't your fault, okay?

718
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,760
Calm down.

719
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,120
Who chose you?

720
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,200
Who's that jerk behind all this?

721
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,760
Well...

722
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,760
It's okay. Just tell me everything. It'll be okay.

723
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,960
He's the CEO of...

724
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,920
Chunsu Insurance.

725
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,440
Are you talking about Oh Chun Su?

726
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,760
Yes.

727
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,080
But someone else paid the manager.

728
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,160
- "Someone else"? - Yes.

729
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,440
I think his name was Woo Byung Sik.

730
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,160
Then why didn't you reveal this videotape?

731
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,360
Why didn't you make it public?

732
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,880
Well...

733
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,600
This is breaking news.

734
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,760
Moojin Time Mart that's located in Moojin City has just collapsed.

735
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,960
We're not exactly sure of the exact damages,

736
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,400
but it seems like there will be a lot of casualties.

737
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,680
There's a possibility of a secondary collapse.

738
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,320
Therefore, the rescuers are having trouble rescuing the victims.

739
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,920
This is breaking news.

740
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,000
Wait for me.

741
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,080
Moojin Time Mart...

742
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,400
I was in the middle of writing down the recorded interview tape.

743
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,560
But I suddenly heard about Moojin Time Mart's collapse.

744
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,600
It was a huge incident back then.

745
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,160
My gosh, I'm tired.

746
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,760
I was busy doing a cover on the collapse.

747
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,840
So it took a few days for me to return to my office.

748
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,680
But when I got back, I found out that the videotape had gone missing.

749
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,920
This is the original videotape.

750
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,120
I'm guessing that she told them about the interview.

751
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,000
So I checked all the footages of the CCTVs in the office,

752
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,120
but I couldn't find who stole it.

753
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,320
I also wondered if Oh Chun Su had hired someone to steal it.

754
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,440
So I went back to the bar looking for that girl.

755
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,000
However, I was too late.

756
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,760
No one investigated the case because there was no evidence.

757
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,640
I told a detective about what had happened, but that was it.

758
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,160
Back then,

759
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,000
I felt really ashamed of myself.

760
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,760
So I quit my job as a director.

761
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,480
That means Oh Chun Su was the one...

762
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,880
who had sex with minors with the help of Woo Byung Sik.

763
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,440
Moojin Time Mart was already known for its poor construction,

764
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,000
so no insurance company would let him sign up for insurance.

765
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,920
I'm guessing that Woo Byung Sik used minors for prostitution...

766
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,360
to get what he wanted from Chunsu Insurance.

767
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,000
Then was this the student...

768
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,560
you had interviewed back then?

769
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,680
It's been so long, so my memory isn't clear.

770
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,160
But I'm sure it wasn't her.

771
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,200
I see.

772
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,760
Then could it be Kim Sun Young?

773
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,200
Yes.

774
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,360
- What? - I think her name...

775
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,920
was Sun Young.

776
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,480
Then is Oh Chun Su the guy that Wang Young Choon was talking about?

777
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,240
Was Oh Chun Su trying to show me this videotape...

778
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,440
so that he could clear my doubts towards his son?

779
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,520
No, that can't be. Then who killed Han Jin Sook?

780
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,840
Oh Chun Su was bedridden in a coma...

781
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,080
when Han Jin Sook was murdered.

782
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,200
- Excuse me. - Wait.

783
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,120
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just a habit.

784
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,320
Yes, keep going.

785
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,560
There's something that keeps bothering me.

786
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,840
The detective I've told you about had left a voice message for me.

787
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,200
Just a moment.

788
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,200
Hey, it's me.

789
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,600
I have something to tell you.

790
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,880
I'll head over right now. Let's talk face to face.

791
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,920
I think Man Ho caused trouble...

792
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,600
because of something that his dad did.

793
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,760
"Man Ho"?

794
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,320
Who's this detective?

795
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,240
He's Song Jae Geun, the chief of Moojin Police Station.

796
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,600
He and I used to be really close back when I used to be a director.

797
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,760
He left a message saying that he was going to come to see me.

798
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,160
But...

799
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,360
he got into an accident that day and died.

800
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,040
I didn't think much about it back then,

801
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,400
but now that I think about it...

802
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,680
Request a search warrant for Oh Man Ho, that jerk, right now!

803
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,920
What's this?

804
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,600
Okay.

805
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,400
Our request for the search and seizure warrant has been denied.

806
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,520
What?

807
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,400
Why? Everything was recorded on Congressman Kim Young Seok's phone.

808
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,040
You idiot. Did you actually think...

809
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,720
that you'd be able to search Royeol's CEO's house with just that?

810
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,880
We have a copy of the commissioner general's voice recording,

811
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,440
a copy of the interview with the minor who had sex with Oh Chun Su,

812
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,120
proof that he instigated Wang Young Choon to commit insurance fraud,

813
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,720
the insurance payout certificate,

814
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,080
proof that the skeleton was found in Moojin and not in Seoul,

815
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,400
the fact that the date overlaps with the one from Woo Byung Sik's photo,

816
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,240
evidence that there's another butterfly watch, and so on!

817
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,440
Everything...

818
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,560
Everything is pointing at Oh Man Ho.

819
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,640
But what more do we need?

820
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,600
They're saying it's not enough. We need more evidence!

821
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,200
So go bring firm evidence which confirms...

822
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,720
that Oh Man Ho actually has the watch.

823
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,600
We don't need anything else. That's all you need to bring!

824
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,640
Gosh, seriously!

825
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,080
Goodness.

826
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,680
Darn it.

827
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,240
What is wrong with this country? Those jerks...

828
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,880
What's that?

829
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,440
This is what you need, right?

830
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,320
The crucial piece of evidence you asked for...

831
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,280
is here.

832
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,200
Okay. Request the search and seizure warrant again!

833
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,400
Detective, please re-investigate my father's death as well.

834
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,000
And these are the documents related to Oh Man Ho's corrupt deeds.

835
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,480
(Royeol Group)

836
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,400
There have been a few unfortunate incidents,

837
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,040
and my father Chairman Oh Chun Su's death...

838
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,000
has also left us disheartened and devastated.

839
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,560
But to make my father's dreams come true,

840
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,480
I make my first promise to you as the new chairman of the group.

841
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,920
I'll make sure that Royeol becomes the number one company in the world.

842
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,600
The first step will be...

843
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,240
the biggest shopping complex in Asia, Moojin Royeol Shopping Mall.

844
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,400
I'll make sure the construction gets completed no matter what.

845
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,440
(30th Anniversary and Inaugural Ceremony)

846
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,080
Mr. Oh Man Ho. You're under arrest for soliciting to murder...

847
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,200
Han Jin Sook.

848
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,560
You have the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent.

849
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,720
Lying in court...

850
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,560
- What are these people doing here? - can work to your disadvantage.

851
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,120
You must know all of that from movies.

852
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,720
Even we don't remember all of that. Arrest him.

853
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,680
- Your meeting is over now. - What is going on?

854
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,280
- Why are they taking him? - What's happening?

855
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,560
- Mr. Chairman... - Can we let them take him?

856
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,560
- Please say a few words. - How do you feel now?

857
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,200
- Is it true? - Please say a few words.

858
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,080
- Did you really do it? - Tell us!

859
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,720
- Why did you do it? - Please tell us how you feel.

860
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,960
The police arrested the vice chairman of Royeol Group,

861
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,640
Mr. Oh Man Ho, as the prime suspect of the freezer murder case.

862
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,120
According to the team at Seoun Police Station,

863
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,480
they have arrested him this morning...

864
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,760
for soliciting to murder Ms. Han,

865
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,880
an insurance planner in her 30s...

866
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,440
Why on earth would I kill a woman whom I don't even know?

867
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,440
Your father received sexual services from a minor...

868
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,280
20 years ago in Moojin. You knew about it, right?

869
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,360
Was it you or your father?

870
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,440
What do you mean?

871
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,600
Which one of you instigated Wang Young Choon to kill Clara?

872
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,040
What on earth are you talking about?

873
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,520
One of you colluded with Wang Young Choon's sister-in-law...

874
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,480
and got him locked up in a mental hospital.

875
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,040
Was it you or your father?

876
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,920
Why you little...

877
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,400
Please remain silent.

878
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,440
There's no way you weren't involved.

879
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,600
If your father had done it alone,

880
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,640
Wang Young Choon wouldn't have killed your mistress,

881
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,680
Lee Mi So, upon escaping the mental hospital.

882
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,160
Mistress?

883
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,520
Who's my mistress?

884
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,400
You got her the exclusive contract to be the face...

885
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,960
of Royeol Electronics even though all the executives were against it.

886
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,360
We already checked the CCTV footages that show...

887
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,120
the two of you dining together at the hotel restaurant.

888
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,880
I can't even dine with my company's model?

889
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,560
Does every woman I dine with become my mistress?

890
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,440
You should've just paid Han Jin Sook one million dollars.

891
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,560
Why did you kill her?

892
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,040
Royeol is one of the biggest conglomerates. One million dollars?

893
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,160
It's not even a big amount to you.

894
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,680
How many times do I have to tell you? I don't know Han Jin Sook.

895
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,280
I've never even met her!

896
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,680
This butterfly watch. It's yours, isn't it?

897
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,360
I already told you that I was somewhere else that day.

898
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,960
Check with my driver.

899
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,640
Okay, that's enough.

900
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,920
Bring him in.

901
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,560
- This way, please. - Please come in.

902
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,120
Please repeat what you told us...

903
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,960
in your statement earlier.

904
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,600
Sure. That day, he gave me some money...

905
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,200
and told me to go home early.

906
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,920
He said that he'd drive himself.

907
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,320
He usually never does that.

908
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,480
Then what happened?

909
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,240
When I got in the car the next day,

910
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,760
I found a receipt from Moojin Tollgate on the floor.

911
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,280
That little... You come here. Hey!

912
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,120
How could you do this to me?

913
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,320
Hey, you rat...

914
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,880
Oh Man Ho is done now.

915
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,880
I must agree.

916
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:44,440
By the way, what's the connection between him and Leo?

917
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,640
That link is still missing.

918
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,880
I'm sure we'll figure it out eventually.

919
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,640
While the details of his motive still remain unknown,

920
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,240
the police are searching for Chairman Oh Man Ho's hitman...

921
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,080
whom he hired to kill the victims.

922
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,160
- The news about his arrest made... - What?

923
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,680
- the group's stock prices drop... - Boss' brother solicited to murder?

924
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,520
My gosh. Why do bad things keep happening to him?

925
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,000
I should go see him quickly.

926
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,120
To tell you the truth, Moo Gang...

927
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,200
didn't lie to use you.

928
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,120
He only found out recently that he's not Kim Joon.

929
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,120
He meant to tell you but missed the right timing to do so.

930
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,160
I guess he was afraid...

931
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,160
that you'd leave him.

932
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,440
I think that's why he couldn't tell you.

933
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,480
Our relationship wasn't going well before he lost his memory.

934
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,440
To be honest,

935
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,720
we were already done with.

936
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,160
But when I heard about his amnesia,

937
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,760
I got greedy and acted...

938
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,560
as if there were no problems in our relationship.

939
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,400
I was forcing him to stay with me.

940
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,440
Moo Gang...

941
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,160
has been emotionally hurt a lot because of me.

942
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,760
I know that this is a selfish thing to ask,

943
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,400
but I'd appreciate it...

944
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,840
if you could stay by his side.

945
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,960
I don't want him to get hurt anymore,

946
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,920
and you're the only one who can make him happy.

947
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,760
So please...

948
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,000
Can you please...

949
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,320
forgive him now?

950
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,800
Moo Gang.

951
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,880
Be happy...

952
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,760
with Ha Ram.

953
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,760
I will...

954
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,320
protect you at all costs.

955
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,640
All right. Great work, everyone.

956
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,640
Let's let ourselves go and have fun today!

957
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,560
- Thank you. - Nice!

958
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,200
- Great work. - Thank you.

959
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,760
- Eat up, guys. - Hey, good job.

960
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:48,120
Hey, the team manager gave me a heads-up...

961
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,080
that our team will no longer...

962
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,800
be a backup support team.

963
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,560
It'll become Violent Crimes Unit Three.

964
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,160
- Seriously? - Finally!

965
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,080
We did it!

966
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,480
- Hey, guys. - Congratulations.

967
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,720
Don't we deserve it?

968
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,400
We dug up all corrupt deeds committed by Royeol Group.

969
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,400
Exactly.

970
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,600
All right. The driving force behind our success,

971
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,800
the last romanticist of our time,

972
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,440
Crazy Dog!

973
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,160
- Crazy Dog! - Crazy Dog!

974
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,240
- Crazy Dog! - Crazy Dog!

975
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,520
That's enough.

976
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,760
It's still too early to congratulate ourselves,

977
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,760
but since I'm in a great mood today, this will be on me!

978
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,560
- Nice. - Hey, don't even start, okay?

979
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,680
- Hey, Short-legged Grandpa. - What?

980
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,680
Why are we eating pork on a day like this?

981
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,080
Shall I teach you a lesson?

982
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,200
- Order beef instead right away. - Goodness.

983
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,160
- Beef! Beef! - You'll regret it big time tomorrow.

984
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,680
- Beef, beef. - Excuse me.

985
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,680
Excuse me!

986
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,520
We want beef instead of pork. Please change the grills now.

987
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,960
- Excuse me. - This is really delicious.

988
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,960
- I know, right? - By the way, why can't we...

989
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,360
get a hold of Moo Gang?

990
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,800
- Why? - I texted him earlier.

991
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,280
Goodness, that idiot. I must feed him some beef too.

992
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,520
- Hey. - Yes, sir.

993
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,160
- I'm sorry. - I shall teach you a lesson.

994
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,440
- I need to pee. - Hey, this looks delicious.

995
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,600
- I'll be back. - This is great.

996
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,400
But what's this?

997
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,600
Who brought this?

998
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,160
I brought that for you.

999
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,720
Why you...

1000
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,440
You're the best.

1001
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,200
- This is how to do it. - Help yourself to the food.

1002
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,800
- Where is he going? - Hey, where are you going?

1003
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,480
- I'm sorry. - What's wrong with him?

1004
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,880
Wait a minute.

1005
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,960
- I'm sorry. Did you get hurt? - What is he doing?

1006
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,960
- Goodness. - I'm sorry.

1007
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,080
Wait... Wait just a minute, please.

1008
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,120
Black.

1009
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,400
Let's get it.

1010
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,360
Do you see it?

1011
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,240
Aren't you in love?

1012
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,880
Where are you going?

1013
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,560
I made up my mind. I'll say goodbye to Ha Ram.

1014
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,720
How did I fall for someone like Ha Ram?

1015
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,120
It's unbelievable.

1016
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,560
What? You'll say goodbye?

1017
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,760
Ha Ram.

1018
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,840
It's too late to fall in love with me now.

1019
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,920
Will you leave Moo Gang's body then?

1020
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,560
But you can't.

1021
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,760
What?

1022
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,240
Whatever. Call the Dead Squad.

1023
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,880
They'll get me out by drilling a hole in my head or something.

1024
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,440
I'd rather be a dog than being mistaken for loving a human.

1025
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,280
Is he leaving without finding his body?

1026
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,520
Such is life.

1027
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,800
It's his destiny.

1028
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,920
(Kim Se Mi, Park Ji Won)

1029
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,520
Excuse me. Where is the patient, Kang Ha Ram?

1030
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,680
- She left the hospital. - Already?

1031
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,200
Here, have some of this. Try it.

1032
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,600
You should regain your strength...

1033
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,720
and do something about your brother.

1034
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,080
Are things going well with Ha Ram?

1035
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,520
- Where's Ha Ram? - It's the police officer.

1036
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,520
Give it to me.

1037
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,880
What is it?

1038
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,800
- Well, it's nothing. - What is it?

1039
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:22,600
Where's Ha Ram? Tell me where she is!

1040
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,680
Why isn't Crazy Dog back yet?

1041
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,920
So Tae.

1042
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,880
Go to the restroom, and see if he fell in the toilet.

1043
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,279
Yes, sir.

1044
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,399
I'll check on him,

1045
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,520
and I'll pee as well.

1046
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,359
You didn't pee much today.

1047
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,720
(Crazy Dog)

1048
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,880
Hey, answer the phone.

1049
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:48,720
You pick it up.

1050
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,880
Get up.

1051
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,480
Why isn't he coming and calling instead?

1052
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,680
- Hello? - Detective Park.

1053
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,160
Where is Crazy Dog? He isn't in the restroom.

1054
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,320
Did he leave without paying for the food?

1055
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,560
What a cheapskate.

1056
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,680
The person you have reached is not available.

1057
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,280
- Goodness. - Please leave a message...

1058
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,720
He isn't answering his phone either. Darn it.

1059
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,080
I should tell Captain Bong to pay for the food.

1060
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,920
I guess he was afraid...

1061
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,880
that you'd leave him.

1062
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,200
Will you be okay?

1063
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,240
You liked Ha Ram a lot.

1064
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,880
Wasn't it going well with her?

1065
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,520
Ha Ram might leave if you keep it that way.

1066
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,520
Where's Ha Ram?

1067
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,960
Tell me where she is.

1068
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,680
Stop the bus.

1069
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,840
Stop the bus, you jerk!

1070
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,080
Where did you see her last? Where is she?

1071
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,560
Where is she?

1072
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,200
Hey, Ha Ram.

1073
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,960
I was thinking of leaving,

1074
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,040
but I had some free time.

1075
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,920
That's why...

1076
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,560
Take care. I'm leaving.

1077
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,560
I thought about it.

1078
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,080
I thought about it a lot.

1079
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,200
But it wasn't because of Joon.

1080
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,440
I liked you because of who you are.

1081
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,200
Moo Gang.

1082
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,160
I liked you because of who you are.

1083
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,200
The one I like...

1084
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,120
is you, Moo Gang.

1085
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,080
(Black)
