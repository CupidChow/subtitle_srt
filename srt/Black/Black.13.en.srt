(Episode 13)

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,480
Ha Ram.

3
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,680
Ha Ram!

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,840
Ha Ram.

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,560
Ha Ram!

6
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Ha Ram.

7
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,160
Ha Ram!

(Red Clay Valley)

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,560
(Chicken Soup, Moojin Pub)

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,160
It was the day after these receipts were issued,

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
so they must've been together on this day too.

12
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,400
Hello.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,640
By any chance,

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,200
do you remember this customer?

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
He used his credit card here.

16
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,400
Of course I remember him.

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,400
I thought he was incredibly handsome.

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,080
I wondered if he's an actor or something.

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,080
He looked a little dowdy though.

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,920
Did someone with him when he came here?

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Yes, that's right.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
He came with a guy who wasn't so articulate.

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,199
Really?

24
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,160
Are there security cameras here?

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,640
Goodness, they were here a long time ago.

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,000
The footage has been erased already.

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,320
Oh, I see.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,560
Then do you happen to remember if he asked you anything?

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,040
He was looking for my boss.

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,560
My boss wasn't here at that time, so he waited for a long time...

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,040
and left saying that he'd be back,

32
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
but I haven't seen him since then.

33
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,360
He left his medication here though. He should come back to get it.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,680
- Medication? - Yes.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,960
Ha Ram!

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,000
Ha Ram.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
Ha Ram!

38
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,840
Ha Ram!

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,160
- Hello? - I have the blood test results.

40
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,120
There's a 99.98 percent chance that it's Ha Ram's blood.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
What?

42
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,760
If she lost over two liters of blood,

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,560
it's impossible for her to survive.

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,840
She... She died?

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,560
Are you sure?

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,960
What is going on?

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Detective Han, what happened to you?

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,040
Even the DNA in the blood matches the DNA...

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,360
in Ms. Kang's blood tested at Royeol Hospital.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,760
That can't be.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
This result could be wrong, right?

52
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,079
Let's do it again.

53
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,440
There could've been an error. Do it again.

54
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
I told you to do it again!

55
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,000
Do another analysis...

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,680
Calm down.

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,600
All right.

58
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,520
- Let's go. - Detective Han.

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,160
- Detective Han, what's wrong? - Hey, what's the matter?

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,960
Are you in pain? Is it here?

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,280
Hello? Is this 911?

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,520
(Han Moo Gang)

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,840
(Prescription History)

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,960
The police believe that the murder suspect,

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,280
Wang Young Choon, has killed two more women.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
They have launched an open search for him...

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,240
since he might commit additional crimes.

68
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,040
Doctor Min.

69
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,240
Oh, Doctor Yoon.

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,320
What happened? You took off without a word.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,760
These medications weren't prescribed for Moo Gang, right?

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,560
He can't take these.

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,640
Who is it? For whom did you use Moo Gang's name?

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
Oh, this.

75
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,160
Moo Gang said that his friend suffers from severe migraines...

76
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
and that this is the only medication that works.

77
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
He asked me to use his name because his friend isn't a Korean citizen.

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,560
He's not a Korean citizen?

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,400
It's complicated for foreigners to get prescription drugs, you know.

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,680
Who is that person? Did you see his face?

81
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,880
Well, what's his name?

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,160
I don't know. Moo Gang came alone back then.

83
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,880
What on earth is going on?

84
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
What's the matter, Doctor Yoon?

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,240
You disappeared after submitting your letter of resignation.

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,120
Moo Gang, Han Moo Gang. Detective Han!

87
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,960
Moo Gang. Moo Gang.

88
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,960
- What happened to him? - I have no idea.

89
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,520
He suddenly clasped his chest in pain and collapsed.

90
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,440
Moo Gang.

91
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,520
Moo Gang.

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
You told her, didn't you?

93
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,760
You must've told Ha Ram.

94
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,720
I told you not to tell her.

95
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,320
I clearly told you not to tell her!

96
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,520
She died because of you.

97
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,320
- She's dead. - What?

98
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,800
I could've kept her safe if I had been by her side.

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,280
I could've protected her!

100
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,040
That woman...

101
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,040
is dead?

102
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,600
(Announcement Regarding the Filming of "Mouse" at Royeol Hospital)

103
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,600
Moo Gang.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,080
You're in no shape to go anywhere now.

105
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Get out of my way.

106
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Gosh...

107
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,840
That woman is dead?

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,160
That jerk killed Kang Ha Ram?

109
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,880
Why on earth did he do that?

110
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,560
I clearly told you not to tell her!

111
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
She died because of you.

112
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Did she really die...

113
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,080
because I separated the two of them?

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,320
You saw the news, right?

115
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,080
Things got a little complicated because of that weird brat.

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,400
I'm going to have to move a little faster than planned.

117
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm going to go to China as soon as I'm done.

118
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,600
But in order to do that, I need some money.

119
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,720
Are you the one who killed Kang Ha Ram?

120
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,120
Did you kill her?

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,760
"Kang Ha Ram"?

122
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,760
Oh, are you talking about that reckless brat?

123
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,520
How do you know her?

124
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,560
Why are you even killing people who are irrelevant to any of this?

125
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,280
What do you mean she's irrelevant?

126
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,760
I told you already.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,120
I told you to watch how I'm going to make him suffer.

128
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,000
Just wait, and see.

129
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,240
There's one more to go.

130
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,120
There's one more person whom he thinks so dearly of.

131
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,400
That person's incomparable to that little girlfriend of his.

132
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Why do you think this was there?

133
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,960
It can't have rolled all the way to the hospital.

134
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
It was obviously there because of Han Moo Gang's mother...

135
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
if it was found at Royeol Hospital.

136
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,320
This is all my fault.

137
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,480
If I didn't lose that capsule...

138
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,320
No. I should've at least stayed by Ha Ram's side.

139
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,160
You really didn't have another choice.

140
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,840
She's the one who didn't want to see you again.

141
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,920
What's going to happen to her soul?

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,760
You're her designated Grim Reaper,

143
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
but you weren't there when she died.

144
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,960
So who's going to take her soul to the afterworld?

145
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,040
The answer is obvious.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,080
No one.

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,200
According to the rules, the designated Grim Reaper...

148
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,320
is supposed to open the capsule as he or she stands beside the soul.

149
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,920
But some other Grim Reaper opened it somewhere else.

150
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,920
I can only imagine how painful and scared that lost soul must've been.

151
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,800
The Grim Reaper should've been there to take her to the afterworld...

152
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,680
after explaining to her that she's dead.

153
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,400
But that Grim Reaper is sadly sitting over there. My goodness.

154
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,760
When humans die,

155
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,280
they don't fully acknowledge what's going on at first.

156
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
They don't realize that they're dead.

157
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,280
Am I really dead?

158
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,320
Isn't it obvious?

159
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,880
I can't believe this.

160
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,560
You're already dead, Han Moo Gang.

161
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,000
No.

162
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,800
I can't.

163
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't die right now.

164
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,560
Even after finding out that they're dead,

165
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,840
they fail to accept it for quite some time.

166
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,560
That's why they never leave their corpse.

167
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,400
That's a very common behavior among dead humans.

168
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,680
Then does that mean Ha Ram's soul is...

169
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
She's probably...

170
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
standing right next to her dead body right now.

171
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
Ha Ram.

172
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,440
Don't go anywhere. Stay right next to your body.

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
I'll go to where you are...

174
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,240
as soon as I capture that jerk.

175
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
Meanwhile, the witness' body has not been found yet.

176
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,400
According to the blood test results,

177
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,040
- she's very likely to be dead. - Try looking for her all you want.

178
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,600
Therefore, the police are already assuming that she's dead.

179
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,760
That brat is the daughter of that detective?

180
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,080
Why did you kill my dad? Why did you kill him?

181
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,320
(20 years ago)

182
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,560
There you are, you little rat.

183
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,040
Give it to me, you punk.

184
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,240
Give it to me!

185
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,920
You little...

186
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,240
Wang Young Choon, you jerk. What do you think you're doing?

187
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,320
Where is he?

188
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Was it that jerk? Did he tell you to do this?

189
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,160
Did he tell you to kill even that little boy?

190
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,480
Why? Tell me why!

191
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,760
Come on, you punk. Take me to that jerk!

192
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,400
Ha Ram.

193
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,960
Ha Ram! Ha Ram!

194
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,840
- Dad! Dad! - No. No, Ha Ram.

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,560
- Dad. - Let's go to your mom.

196
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
The guy who killed my dad is over there.

197
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,480
Who?

198
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,040
That guy with a spider tattoo on his hand.

199
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,320
What? Where did he go?

200
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,560
Did she see me kill him?

201
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,240
How did that little girl kid know that I killed him?

202
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,160
She recognized me back then.

203
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,480
How in the world did she manage to come find me today too?

204
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,040
(Seoun Police Station)

205
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,600
Right before Wang Young Choon was about to receive his wife's...

206
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,360
death benefit after the fire accident in Moojin 20 years ago,

207
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,000
he started getting investigated for the suspicion of having killed...

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,800
his wife by setting a fire in disguise.

209
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,960
However, in that process, he suddenly disappeared.

210
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
It turns out...

211
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,080
that he was hospitalized at Hope Mental Hospital.

212
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,520
Unfortunately, his medical records were all deleted.

213
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,840
So we're not exactly sure about why he got hospitalized.

214
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,280
But seeing how his sister-in-law and her husband...

215
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,160
ended up receiving his wife's death benefit,

216
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,840
and from the fact that he brutally killed his sister-in-law...

217
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,840
right after he escaped from the mental hospital...

218
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,680
after killing the hospital director,

219
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,920
we can assume that his sister-in-law and her husband...

220
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,240
forcefully locked him up at the hospital...

221
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,920
by conspiring with the hospital director.

222
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,240
He's a Korean-Chinese.

223
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,240
Yes, that's right. He's from Jilin.

224
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,560
He came to Korea after he got married to Kim Na Kyung in China.

225
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,920
But the fact that he's able to stay hidden...

226
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,760
after having escaped from the hospital...

227
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,680
means that he's definitely receiving help from someone.

228
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,240
We'll start with investigating his acquaintances.

229
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,080
Why would you do that?

230
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Did you forget that our team is in charge...

231
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,520
of the Hope Mental Hospital's murder incident?

232
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,520
You guys should rather handle the phone calls from witnesses.

233
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,080
Just a moment.

234
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm the one who initially found out about Lee Mi So's murder incident.

235
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,640
That naturally makes it our team's case.

236
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,160
Detective Han was also the first one to find out about...

237
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,920
the murder of Wang Young Choon's sister-in-law.

238
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,880
That means it's our team's case.

239
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,120
I wasn't going to say this at first.

240
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,080
But we were also the first to get to Kang Ha Ram's murder incident.

241
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,720
Plus, she's Detective Han's hometown friend.

242
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,160
That means it should naturally be our team's case.

243
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,760
Crazy Dog, stay out of this.

244
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,320
You got punished for biting a prosecutor.

245
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,720
You little jerk.

246
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
- This isn't any ordinary case. - Stop it.

247
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
This is a serial murder case. The whole country is shivering in fear.

248
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,720
You guys are overzealous when you're not even competent.

249
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,960
You and your teammates can take all the phone calls from witnesses.

250
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,280
-Did you call us incompetent? - Stop.

251
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,280
If you're so competent, did you find anything new about this case?

252
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,839
You're just trying to take the case...

253
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,040
that we've been working so hard on just so you can take the credit.

254
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,720
What did you just say?

255
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,400
- You little jerk. - Why? Was I being too honest?

256
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,839
Shut it!

257
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,440
The Blue House and our citizens are focused on this case.

258
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,040
A special investigation team will be made in a few days.

259
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,440
Until then, just do what you've been doing,

260
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,720
- and help each other out. - Pardon?

261
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,600
- Do you understand? - But sir...

262
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,080
- Wait. - Sir!

263
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,520
- That makes no sense. - Sir!

264
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,240
Hey, listen to me!

265
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
Make sure you answer every call, okay?

266
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
- Gosh, those jerks... - Calm down.

267
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,000
- You jerks. - Enough. Calm down already.

268
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,360
If you cause another trouble, you'll get more than just a pay cut.

269
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,680
Just calm down.

270
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
Gosh, they're so mean to us.

271
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,160
Moo Gang, how are you feeling? Are you all right?

272
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
What happened? Have we not caught that jerk yet?

273
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,280
No, not yet.

274
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,360
Hey, we'll catch the killer at all costs,

275
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
so just go home, and get some rest.

276
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,480
What?

277
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,200
The last number Ha Ram dialed...

278
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,960
was the police helpline?

279
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,520
Yes, it was.

280
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,440
I checked the recording of the call,

281
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,560
but she hung up without even giving us the address.

282
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,720
We assumed that it was a prank call and didn't even dispatch anyone.

283
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,280
We, the police, have to take all the blame...

284
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,440
because of women like her.

285
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,360
Why was she so fearless?

286
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,720
How can she try to catch the killer on her own?

287
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,520
Did she want to die or what? Goodness.

288
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,120
She literally dug her own grave, but the police now have to deal with...

289
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,320
- Hey! - Gosh.

290
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,360
- Detective Han, don't. - Let go.

291
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,320
- You jerk. - Hey, don't.

292
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,160
That girl deserved to die.

293
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,040
- Let go! - You lunatic!

294
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,160
How dare you punch your superior?

295
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,480
- You piece of... - Gosh!

296
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,960
Let go. I'm going to beat that jerk to a pulp today.

297
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,880
- Let go of me! - What on earth is happening here?

298
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,480
That idiot is crazier than I thought.

299
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,000
Suspend that punk immediately.

300
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,240
Take firearms and everything else from him!

301
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,880
That punk. What a lunatic.

302
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,280
- Guys, hold him properly! - Let go of me.

303
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,160
- Let go. Let go of me. - I got the gun.

304
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,800
- My gun... Give it back. - Get him out of here!

305
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,040
- Give it back! - Moo Gang, let's go.

306
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,760
- Have you really lost your mind? - Let's go, okay?

307
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,800
Get him out of here.

308
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,480
My gun. I want my gun back!

309
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,160
- Gosh, enough. Let's just go. - Captain Bong!

310
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,280
Excuse me, officers. Where's my daughter?

311
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,480
Are you Kang Ha Ram's mother?

312
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,400
- Where... Where's my daughter now? - Oh, right.

313
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,240
We're trying to get a hold of her at the moment,

314
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,520
but unfortunately, it looks like...

315
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,200
- No, no. That can't be. - My gosh.

316
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,920
- I'm certain that she's alive. - Please calm down.

317
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
- Ma'am. - She's...

318
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,400
- We're trying to get a hold of her. - She's such a strong person.

319
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,440
Even the Grim Reaper wouldn't be able to take her.

320
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,320
So please find her.

321
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,560
- My gosh, please find my daughter. - Hey, you stay here.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,960
- No, please... - Hey.

323
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,920
- Please calm down. - Gosh, what should I do?

324
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,680
- Please save her. - Okay, we'll do our best.

325
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,880
Gosh, that poor thing.

326
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,120

Okay, we've been trying to contact her. We'll keep trying.

Gosh, my poor daughter. What should I do now?

Where have I seen her before?

We'll look over it again and...

Yes.

332

Everyone in the country knows his face now,

I really know him.

352
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,760
Doesn't he have a tattoo like this on the back of his hand?

I'm originally from Jilin, China.

356
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,400
There were many rumors about him back in my hometown.

357
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,680
He vanished a long time ago, so I assumed that he must be dead.

358
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,120
I was so surprised when I saw the APB on him with his photo.

359
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,240
In Jilin, there's a famous criminal ring...

named the Tarantula Gang.

"Tarantula"?

362
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,040
They were very influential in the area.

363
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,440
He was the enforcer of that organization.

364
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,160
I also heard...

365
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,400
that he worked as a hitman as a side job.

Oh, that's right. He said his name is Han Moo Gang.

He came to see us last fall and asked us about everything.

He was looking for Wang Young Choon?

416

You're obviously not cut out to be a detective.

You said you've graduated from a prestigious university in the US.

There's something I must do.

420
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,920
Something that he must do...

421
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,960
Right, he became a detective for his own reasons.

422
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,480
The first reason must've been finding Wang Young Choon.

423
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,720
He had to become a detective to be able to track down gang members.

424
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,120
He started looking...

425
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,840
for members of the Tarantula Gang as soon as he joined the force...

426
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,960
and tried to track down Wang Young Choon.

427
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,360
Then in about a year,

428
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,680
he finally found out that Wang Young Choon was at the mental hospital.

429
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
And...

430
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,240
on the 15th of September, he went to Hope Mental Hospital,

431
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,000
met Wang Young Choon,

432
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,480
and showed him his brother's picture.

433
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,920
Then did Wang Young Choon...

434
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,160
kill Han Moo Gang's brother?

435
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,360
- Yes. - Have you found him?

436
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,640
I've finished investigating members of the Tarantula Gang.

437
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,720
They've lost contact with Wang Young Choon for over 20 years.

438
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,840
Is that so?

439
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,080
I see.

440
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,040
Before he lost his memory, Moo Gang investigated these cases...

441
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,000
because they're all connected.

442
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,120
Clara and Kim Joon were killed...

443
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,360
just one kilometer apart from each other on the same day.

444
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,200
Clara was right here.

445
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,640
Someone killed her...

446
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,840
by hitting her head from behind with a blunt weapon.

447
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,000
Kim Joon witnessed it and ran away, and the suspect chased after him.

448
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,000
And right here,

449
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,840
the suspect probably hit Kim Joon with a car.

450

451
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,200
when the case happened,

452
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Wang Young Choon was living in Moojin.

453
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,040
So, you mean Clara and Moo Gang's brother...

454
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,080
were killed by Wang Young Choon? Why?

455
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,960
Did you say that the Tarantula Gang murdered by contract in China?

456
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,160
Then is this guy ordering them to do it?

457
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,960
At that time, Wang Young Choon...

458
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,600
had a million dollars received from insurance as his wife died.

459
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,920
He had enough money. Why would he work on a contract murder?

460
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,800
- It doesn't make any sense. - You're right.

461
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,640

Yes, it is mine.

I'm asking you because I don't know.

This is insurance fraud.

How long does it usually take to investigate it?

480
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,920
It depends, but it usually takes from one to several months.

one million dollars were paid.

489
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,520
If you had the right to suspend the settlement at that time,

490
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,880
being the headquarter director, you had a right to authorize payment.

491
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,720
Is that right?

492
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,920
That's right.

493
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,720
Then how did the payment suddenly get authorized...

494
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,480
after 10 days of suspending the settlement?

495
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,640
It's even before the ink on the document dries out.

496
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,640
Well, it happened 20 years ago as you can see.

497
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,280
I can't remember it.

498
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,880
You can't remember it?

499
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,400
No.

500
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,640
Usually, in a year... No.

501
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,200
In just one month. Do you know how many insurance frauds...

502
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,720
and settlements occur?

503
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,840
This case happened 20 years ago.

504
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,160
Why are you doing this now?

505
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,200
I see. Then...

506
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,080
do you know who this is?

507
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,240
I saw him on television.

508
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,240
He's a serial killer, right?

509
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
He is...

510
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,440
Wang Young Choon, the insurance beneficiary.

511
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,160
You autographed the request for suspending claim settlement...

512
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,680
when you were the headquarter director, Vice President Oh.

513
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,880
So the payment was suspended.

514
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,160
After 10 days,

515
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,640
he received one million dollars from insurance.

516
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Unfortunately, he had to go to a mental hospital.

517
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,440
So the money went to the next beneficiary, his sister-in-law.

518
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,600
However, during the 10-day-period between...

519
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,680
the settlement suspension and the insurance payment,

520
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,280
two murders happened in Moojin.

521
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,200
The owner of a pub called Pumpkin Singer...

522
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,160
and a thirteen-year-old boy.

523
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,200
Vice President Oh.

524
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,240
20 years ago,

525
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,040
the owner of Pumpkin Singer managed a VVIP bar.

526
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,640
Weren't you a regular at the bar?

527
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,320
What?

528
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,400
To hide that you bought sexual services from minors,

529
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,680
you used this man who committed insurance fraud...

530
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,000
to get rid of a person and gave him one million dollars in return.

531
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,080
It could be quite a good deal for you.

532
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,080
Isn't it, Mr. Oh?

533
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,680
Buying sexual services from minors and killing someone?

534
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,000
What are you talking about now?

535
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,800
Then tell me.

536
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,880
Who signed this request for claim settlement?

537
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,920
If you didn't do it, show me the original copy.

538
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,240
It only takes a phone call, doesn't it?

539
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,120
Hey, what do you want now?

540
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,000
It seems like you want to interrogate me.

541
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,200
You should bring a warrant next time.

542
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,680
If you can bring it.

543
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,960
Send me a guard.

544
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,560
No, I can leave myself.

545
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,760
All right. I'll see when I bring the warrant...

546
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,360
if it was you...

547
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,880
who signed this document...

548
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,160
or some other jerk did it.

549
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,560
Thank you for your time.

550
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,760
My goodness.

551
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,200
Gosh.

552
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,400
I deleted all the data.

553
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,320
I must find the original copy.

554
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,720
Oh Man Ho, you jerk. I got you.

555
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,240
If I could only confirm that he has that butterfly watch,

556
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,960
I can request a search warrant.

557
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,400
Oh Man Soo?

558
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,440
Not Han Moo Gang, but you.

559
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,440
I want to see your face, Ha Ram.

560
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,520
How come there's not even a single picture of you?

561
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,320
What? Did you think that I would be scared and shake with fear?

562
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
Get lost if you want to live as a normal man.

563
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,720
You stupid. You said we should save people's lives!

564
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,920
This is ridiculous. Gosh.

565
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,680
Where are you?

566
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,600
I wish I could at least hear your voice, Ha Ram.

567
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,240
Your voice.

568
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,800
The last number Ha Ram dialed...

569
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,720
was the police helpline?

570
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,880
Yes, it was.

571
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,840
I checked the recording of the call,

572
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,160
but she hung up without even giving us the address.

573
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,280
Hi, you know,

574
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,200
I need to ask you something.

575
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,240
Is this the police? A serial killer is going to kill someone.

576
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,840
I mean, he will kill someone.

577
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,960
Please come here quickly. The address is...

578
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,240
We're collecting broken refrigerators...

579
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,720
- and electric fans. - No, it's now. What should I do?

580
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,760
You should have called me.

581
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,080
Is this the police? A serial killer is going to kill someone.

582
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,680
I mean, he will kill someone.

583
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,840
Please come here quickly. The address is...

584
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,160
We're collecting broken refrigerators...

585
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,840
- and electric fans. - No, it's now. What should I do?

586
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,880
Ha Ram called the police at this hour.

587
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,760
The truck should pass by any minute now.

588
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,320
We're collecting broken refrigerators and electric fans.

589
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,800
What? Detective Han!

590
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,920
I heard you got into an accident when I went to pick up my mother.

591
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,800
I felt so apologetic and ashamed when I heard about the accident.

592
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,080
Are you okay now?

593
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,840
Thanks to what happened that day, I was able to buy a new truck.

594
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,720
I can bring my mom with me like this. It's really comfortable.

595
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,120
If you need anything fixed, I'll fix them for free.

596
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,160
That's okay.

597
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,200
Do you know that someone died in that house a few days ago?

598
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,600
Yes, I do.

599
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,000
Did you happen to see a truck or any weird people that day?

600
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,280
The truck!

601
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,560
I slightly bumped into a truck that was illegally parked over there.

602
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,960
But the license plate number was all faded away.

603
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,200
"The license plate number"?

604
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,920
I kept calling the number that was stuck on the front mirror,

605
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,600
but that person never picked up. That's why I left my number instead.

606
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,440
But I never got a callback.

607
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,000
Can you tell me the number that you called?

608
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,720
Yes. Here.

609
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,720
How long has the chairman been bedridden?

610
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,440
It's been about seven years.

611
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
How's his condition?

612
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,760
He's become a lot better these days.

613
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,680
He also regained his consciousness now.

614
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,120
But we can never be sure when he might have another heart attack.

615
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,640
So we still cannot be at ease.

616
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,480
Does that mean he's able to communicate?

617
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Yes, that's not a problem.

618
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
Then...

619
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,520
would it be okay for me to meet him?

620
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,480
You should ask for CEO Oh's permission first.

621
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,000
Well...

622
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,360
He might be involved in a case that we're investigating right now.

623
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,200
I just need to meet the chairman and ask him one simple question.

624
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,520
The serial murder suspect, Wang Young Choon,

625
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,720
murdered the hospital director of Hope Mental Hospital,

626
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,120
Lee Mi So, the actress,

627
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,240
- Hello, sir. - and...

628
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,000
he even ended up killing a witness of his murder, Ms. K.

629
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,520
Ms. K's corpse hasn't been found yet.

630
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,760
I'm Detective Na from Seoun Police Station.

631
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,680
There have been many reports about Wang Young Choon from the citizens,

632
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,680
but the police still have not been able to find him yet.

633
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,840
I'd like to ask you something regarding your eldest son.

634
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,160
It has complicated the investigation.

635
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,680
The serial murder incident,

636
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,080
- Wang Young Choon is... - Have you seen this watch before?

637
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,400
a middle-aged man in his 50s, and he's 175cm tall.

638
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,360
This watch belongs to your eldest son, doesn't it?

639
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,200
Sir, you need to answer my question.

640
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
The doctor already told me that you're capable of communicating.

641
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,320
Sir, do you even know what your eldest son is up to right now?

642
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,720
He's killing people just so he can hide...

643
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,040
the sex trafficking of minors that happened in Moojin 20 years ago.

644
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,720
He killed this woman and this woman.

645
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,280
And that jerk, Wang Young Choon, whom your son hired for murder,

646
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,520
is still out there and killing people.

647
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,160
You need to answer my question if you want us to stop him.

648
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,160
If you don't, your son will...

649
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
Well...

650
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,840
What are you doing here? No one's allowed in here.

651
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,360
Wait. Wait. I'm a detective.

652
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,960
Let me go. I said I'm a detective.

653
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,520
Hey, you punks! Let me go! I'm a detective!

654
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Sir, please answer my question!

655
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm going to come back with a warrant!

656
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,760
Sir! Sir!

657
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,000
How far are you going to go with this?

658
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,920
How many more people are you planning to kill?

659
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,200
I want you to stop now.

660
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm not going to stay still if you don't.

661
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,480
Where in the world is he?

662
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,720
Answer me!

663
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,120
I don't know anything about him. So don't ever come back.

664
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,360
Your brother-in-law will kill you. Run away now.

665
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,280
You're insane.

666
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,920
Wait.

667
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,800
Is this the police? A serial killer is going to kill someone.

668
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,400
I mean, he will kill someone.

669
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,600
Please come here quickly. The address is...

670
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,400
We're collecting broken refrigerators and electric fans.

671
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,120
We're collecting broken refrigerators...

672
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,760
No, it's now. What should I do?

673
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,400
No.

674
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,280
Who are you?

675
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,400
You jerk. You're the one who killed my dad, aren't you?

676
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,880
I know that you killed my dad.

677
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,640
Why did you kill my dad? Why did you kill him?

678
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,600
Why? Why?

679
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,240
You must want to get yourself killed.

680
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,720
Why did you kill my dad?

681
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,240
Why did you kill him? Why?

682
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,360
Who is your dad?

683
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,120
Kang Soo Hyuk. Detective Kang Soo Hyuk.

684
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
What?

685
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,040
Does this mean he's after two more people?

686
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,680
If I find whom he's after and wait for him there, he'll show up.

687
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,200
The photos...

688
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,040
Where are the photos?

689
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,000
(You'll end up regretting your past deeds to the bone.)

690
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,080
(I'll make you fall into the fiery pit, so brace yourself.)

691
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,880
I have the blood test result that you requested.

692
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,640
It turns out that it was an animal's blood.

693
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,200
"Animal's blood"?

694
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,880
What?

695
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,480
Does this mean Leo's going to be the next target?

696
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,960
Where is she?

697
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,000
Where's Ha Ram?

698
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,560
Who?

699
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,160
Kang Soo Hyuk's daughter?

700
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,480
Why bother looking for her dead body?

701
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,040
Where is she?

702
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,960
Okay, okay.

703
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,320
Just a second.

704
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,240
I've seen this somewhere before.

705
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,440
My gosh.

706
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,760
Where's Ha Ram? Where is she?

707
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,120
Stop it.

708
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,200
You won't be able to find her if you kill me.

709
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,480
Where is she?

710
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,800
I'm scared. I'm scared.

711
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,200
Okay, okay.

712
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,800
I'll take you to where she is.

713
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,440
I'll take you to her corpse.

714
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,560
Can you stop holding onto me? I can't drive properly.

715
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,080
Shut your mouth, and just drive.

716
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,760
Okay, okay.

717
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,240
I wouldn't have killed her if I knew that she was close to you...

718
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,120
because I owe you a lot.

719
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,200
What?

720
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,480
What? Did you really lose your memory?

721
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,080
Or are you just pretending not to know?

722
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,680
I was able to escape from the hospital...

723
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,480
because you helped me regain my consciousness.

724
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,120
If it weren't for you, I would've been drugged for my entire life.

725
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,760
I'm Detective Han from Seoun Police Station.

726
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,760
Can you recognize me?

727
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,040
I'm the guy who gave you that scar on your face.

728
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,800
He's Lee Byeong Tae, the son of Lee Jung Bae from Chunsu Insurance.

729
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,080
My brother got killed in Moojin.

730
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,320
And his father got killed in the States.

731
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,720
I've been looking everywhere for you for the past year.

732
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,600
You killed this boy, didn't you?

733
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,680
Look at it carefully, you jerk.

734
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,880
You're the guy who chased after my brother on the day he died.

735
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,200
What happened that day?

736
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,840
Why did you...

737
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,400
kill my brother? Tell me.

738
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,960
Tell me what happened. Tell me!

739
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,240
You know what?

740
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,680
I thought you were the only person behind all this until now.

741
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,440
But after I met him,

742
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,920
I found out that his dad got murdered in the States...

743
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,600
after you got hospitalized here.

744
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,880
Wang Young Choon.

745
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,720
That means you're not the guy who killed his dad, right?

746
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,720
Wang Young Choon.

747
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,400
Someone ordered you to kill my brother, right?

748
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,640
It was the guy who locked you in here for 20 years, right?

749
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,560
Who is that guy? Tell me.

750
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,000
Tell me who that guy is. Tell me.

751
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,400
Come on. Tell me.

752
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,440
Tell me, you jerk! Who is he?

753
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,200
Moo Gang, he's not sane right now.

754
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,400
He's completely overdosed. He can't even think properly.

755
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,440
Wang Young Choon, wait here.

756
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,400
From this day forward, don't take a single pill...

757
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,600
that the nurse gives you. Okay?

758
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,480
Here.

759
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,320
Keep it.

760
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,440
I want you to remember my brother. Do you understand?

761
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,760
I'll come back in a few days.

762
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,680
I want you to be sane when I come back.

763
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,680
After you left, I threw away all the pills the nurse gave me.

764
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,960
And I waited for you to come back after remembering your brother.

765
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,040
Why didn't you show up?

766
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,480
Don't worry. We've been constantly giving him medicine.

767
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,760
So he's being kept high on drugs.

768
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,560
Yes.

769
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,680
He never said anything about a videotape.

770
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,040
What kind of videotape...

771
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,520
It's him, isn't it?

772
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,520
You and he schemed to lock me up in here, right?

773
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,320
You and that punk locked me up in here...

774
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,640
for 20 years.

775
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,920
You wanted to know what happened on the day of your brother's death.

776
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,960
It was all his doing.

777
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,280
The jerk who asked me to kill that madam at the bar.

778
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,760
He threatened me,

779
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,600
knowing that I killed my wife for the insurance payout.

780
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,000
He said he'd get me the insurance payout if I brought the tape to him.

781
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,680
Clara?

782
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,680
Give me the tape.

783
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,720
Give it to me right now!

784
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,760
Who are you?

785
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,760
You don't need to know who I am.

786
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,840
Give me the tape.

787
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,960
That scoundrel must've sent you.

788
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,880
Isn't he colluding with Sun Young?

789
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,160
I don't know where it is. I don't have it.

790
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,040
Ask her.

791
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,320
I think she has it.

792
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,320
You wench.

793
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,160
Stop spewing nonsense, and just give me the tape.

794
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,640
You better give it to me before I slit your throat.

795
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,000
Do it.

796
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,160
Kill me!

797
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,120
Go ahead, and slit my throat.

798
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,120
You little... How dare you.

799
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,200
You jerk!

800
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,600
(Handle with Care, Flammable Material)

801
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,360
So Han Moo Gang didn't kill that woman.

802
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,200
It was this jerk's doing.

803
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,440
No, Moo Gang!

804
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,880
Hang on.

805
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,040
Then she didn't die from a fractured skull. She was stabbed to death.

806
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,680
Then did you kill Han Moo Gang's brother, Kim Joon, too?

807
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,960
Because of that tape?

808
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,160
I didn't kill your brother.

809
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,000
I wasn't even able to get my hands on that tape.

810
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,080
I lied and said that I hid the tape because I couldn't find it.

811
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,400
I told him that I'd give it to him if he gives me the insurance money,

812
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,800
and he locked me up at the mental hospital.

813
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,560
He must've been anxious even though he knew that it couldn't be found.

814
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,240
Then if you didn't kill Kim Joon...

815
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,520
It was his doing.

816
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,560
I'm pretty certain that he killed him. That jerk.

817
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,560
You have no idea how much I've been waiting for this day.

818
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,640
Killing him very slowly is my way of getting back at him.

819
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,560
That's why I killed his girlfriend...

820
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,440
as well as my sister-in-law and her ex-husband who colluded with him...

821
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,040
and locked me up at the mental hospital.

822
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,240
Why did you kill Ha Ram, then?

823
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,520
You had no reason to kill her if all of this was for revenge!

824
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,320
That wench came at me first!

825
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,040
She came at me and asked why I killed her dad.

826
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,600
- Why did she get in my way... - Shut your mouth, jerk!

827
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,920
Actually, come to think of it,

828
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,360
that jerk is responsible for that too.

829
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,040
I also killed that girl's dad because he ordered me to do so.

830
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,440
What?

831
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,320
From your brother, that girl, and even her dad.

832
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,000
Everyone died because of that jerk.

833
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,440
So let's get back at him together. Okay?

834
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,960
We're almost there. We can get our revenge soon.

835
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,880
We need to kill just one more person.

836
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,640
The person who's dearest to him.

837
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,440
Then when he's completely outraged,

838
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,880
we'll slit his throat and accomplish our mission!

839
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,120
We'll do it very slowly...

840
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,160
to maximize the pain!

841
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,680
Let's kill him!

842
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,680
- Let's kill him! - Shut it, you lunatic.

843
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,560
Shut your mouth.

844
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,440
Just take me to Ha Ram.

845
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,200
Kang Ha Ram. Kang Ha Ram.

846
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,800
None of the women I have killed in the past resisted that much.

847
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,000
Killing that girl was so fun.

848
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,560
Kang Ha Ram! Kang Ha Ram!

849
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,480
- You psycho. - Kang Ha Ram!

850
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,480
What...

851
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,840
What was that?

852
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,800
You punks,

853
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,320
I'll kill every single one of you.

854
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,200
Sorry? They requested a search and seizure warrant against me?

855
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,920
That's right. It looks like you're connected to a murder case.

856
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,640
I made sure that it doesn't go through, so don't worry too much.

857
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,920
My gosh. Thank you, Senator Nam.

858
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,480
Oh, I heard that you've decided to run for the presidential election.

859
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,320
I'll send you a box of apples soon.

860
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,760
Bye.

861
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,680
I made sure to wipe all data from 1997.

862
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,680
How did those documents end up in the detective's hands?

863
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,800
Hi. It's been a while, Mr. Hwang.

864
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,920
Yes, hello.

865
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,960
Well, about the documents from 1997...

866
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,400
We had been storing them in our building,

867
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,680
but...

868
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,240
they were requested by Mr. Oh Man Soo, so...

869
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,280
What?

870
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,400
Man Soo, that rat.

871
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,440
Gosh, that punk is intentionally avoiding my calls.

872
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,320
Well, ma'am. Please don't wait here.

873
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,000
You should just wait at home.

874
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I'll call you as soon as we hear anything.

875
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,440
I won't go anywhere until my daughter is found.

876
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,560
Hello?

877
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,720
Sorry?

878
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,080
Hoon Seok?

879
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,640
Oh, I see. Okay.

880
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,240
My son recently had surgery, but his condition has suddenly worsened.

881
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,680
I'll go see him quickly.

882
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,840
Please call me if you hear anything about Ha Ram.

883
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,920
Yes, of course. Please get going.

884
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,160
- I'll make sure to call you. - Thank you.

885
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,160
Goodbye.

886
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,040
We need to search Oh Man Ho's house and office.

887
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,720
Why wouldn't they issue the warrant?

888
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,360
He holds the reins of Royeol Group. Did you think it'd be that easy?

889
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,800
We're not even sure if he has the same butterfly watch.

890
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,040
Gosh, are you kidding me right now?

891
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,560
Why would we request a search and seizure warrant if we're sure?

892
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,520
We'd request an arrest warrant right away.

893
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,240
- That is true. - Goodness.

894
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,160
Gosh.

895
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
What's this?

896
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,560
Isn't this my cell phone number?

897
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,040
Who's pulling a prank with my phone?

898
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,760
Give it back. Bring it here.

899
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,720
Hang on.

900
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,120
What?

901
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,000
Hello? I'm the owner of the cell phone.

902
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,200
This is Oh Chul Soo.

903
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,720
Let's meet.

904
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,320
There's something I must tell you urgently.

905
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,840
Hello.

906
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,080
Sir, you had asked us to pay special attention...

907
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,720
- to Leo's filming here... - Get out of my way.

908
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,480
I don't want to get a shot.

909
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,720
Gosh, you're not getting a shot today.

910
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,960
You'll just see the doctor and get your medication, okay?

911
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,280
Let's go.

912
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,400
Okay.

913
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,000
Oh, that's Leo. I'm a huge fan of his.

914
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,600
He's playing a detective? What a joke.

915
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,280
Let's go.

916
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,400
I'm sorry.

917
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,560
His condition has been stabilized now, so please don't worry too much.

918
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,320
Thank you. I really appreciate it, Doctor.

919
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,840
Have they still heard nothing about Ha Ram?

920
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,520
Gosh, all that practice paid off. Your acting was so impressive today.

921
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,640
We have some time until the call for your next scene, so get some rest.

922
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,640
All right.

923
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,760
Gosh, who keeps sending such terrible things like this?

924
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,720
Seriously.

925
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,720
Move to the next room. I need to use this room.

926
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,000
Okay.

927
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,640
Where is it?

928
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,040
Where's the original copy of Wang Young Choon's insurance payment?

929
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,480
Where did you hide it?

930
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,600
Man Ho.

931
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,080
Why...

932
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,600
Why are you doing this? Why?

933
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,960
I caught you.

934
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,680
Where did you go? We were still talking.

935
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,880
What happened?

936
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,920
I definitely killed you.

937
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,880
When? Me?

938
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,640
Were you dreaming?

939
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,200
Where's Ha Ram?

940
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,640
You jerk.

941
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,120
So did you...

942
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,400
give me the watch that Woo Byung Sik gave to bribe you with?

943
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,640
Do you know what I'm doing to conceal your crime...

944
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,920
and to save our company?

945
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,840
I'm sorry, Man Ho.

946
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,640
I'm sorry...

947
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,440
for making you this way.

948
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,240
I'll quit soon.

949
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,960
So you, Man Ho,

950
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,640
should stop now too.

951
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,880
Stop? It's too late.

952
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,600
It's too late to stop.

953
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:22,680
I'll go after anyone who tries to get in my way.

954
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,560
Do you think I can't?

955
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,800
Do you think I can't do it?

956
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:33,479
Why don't you just die instead?

957
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,120
I beg you.

958
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,960
Just...

959
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,680
Just die.

960
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,640
Just die.

961
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,680
Go upstairs, and distract the security guards.

962
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,040
I'll go upstairs after parking.

963
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,359
- What? - Go now.

964
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,240
- There are four of them, okay? - Hurry up.

965
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,960
Freeze. Don't come near me!

966
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,960
Don't come near me!

967
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,840
Everyone, freeze!

968
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:41,279
Stop the bus.

969
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,880
Stop it!

970
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,000
Stop!

971
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,160
What?

972
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:49,640
Hey, Han Moo Gang!

973
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,040
What are you doing over there?

974
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,120
- Wait. - Hurry up.

975
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,840
Give me your mobile phone.

976
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,840
Let's go first.

977
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,400
Wait, don't leave me.

978
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,560
He took his gun from him.

979
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,040
What? He lost his gun?

980
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,560
Accelerate.

981
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,160
It's an emergency.

982
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,800
Wang Young Choon is running away in a shuttle bus.

983
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,840
There are many hostages. He has a gun.

984
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,840
It's an emergency. We need help!

985
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,400
Seriously, that jerk!

986
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,760
Step on it!

987
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,720
This is too scary now!

988
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,360
Stop the bus, you jerk!

989
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,720
Mister.

990
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,360
- Please help us, Mister. - Stop the bus, you jerk!

991
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,040
Goodness.

992
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,560
Stop the bus, you jerk.

993
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,200
- Darn it, I forgot about the gun. - Stop the bus, you jerk!

994
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,840
Hey, I'll kill you all if you don't keep quiet!

995
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,000
Stop it!

996
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,600
- Darn it. - That jerk.

997
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,800
- Hey, I'm going to kill him today. - Wait just a bit.

998
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,880
Be careful, Moo Gang.

999
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,000
Stop!

1000
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,680
Mister will make him pay.

1001
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,600
No.

1002
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,800
Are you okay?

1003
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,840
It's Lee Jung Bae's file that you were looking for.

1004
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:26,320
As you said, he was an examiner for Chunsu Insurance in 1997.

1005
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,960
But he immigrated to the US after quitting his job.

1006
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,040
To the US?

1007
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,920
Yes, but two years after he went to the US,

1008
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,000
he died in a car accident.

1009
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,600
He died? What about his son?

1010
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,920
Is his son still alive?

1011
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,640
It was very hard to track his son.

1012
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,480
However,

1013
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:53,080
I found a copy of the son's passport...

1014
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,240
when he entered Korea.

1015
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,360
"Lee Byeong Tae".

1016
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,560
Moo Gang's agent's name was BT.

1017
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,040
It was Byeong Tae.

1018
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,200
Please find this man. I'll pay as much as you want.

1019
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,920
- Yes, ma'am. - Wang Young Choon...

1020
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,560
is running away in a shuttle bus with hostages.

1021
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,680
- What you see are hostages... - Moo Gang.

1022
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,080
Stop the bus, you jerk!

1023
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,760
You stop, punk!

1024
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:33,800
Get closer!

1025
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,960
I think Han Moo Gang will catch him.

1026
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,440
What if...

1027
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,680
it becomes dangerous for the hostages?

1028
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,240
Okay, sir.

1029
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,600
You punk.

1030
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,960
Oh, no.

1031
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,120
Stop the bus, you jerk.

1032
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,520
Otherwise, you'll die.

1033
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,320
You'll die. Do you hear me?

1034
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,520
Where is Ha Ram, you jerk?

1035
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,000
No, don't shoot him!

1036
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,080
Get out! Get out of the way, Moo Gang!

1037
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,280
No!

1038
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,960
Don't shoot!

1039
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,680
Get out of the way!

1040
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,280
Don't shoot him.

1041
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,040
That imbecile!

1042
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,560
Don't shoot, you jerk!

1043
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,400
Where did you see her last?

1044
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,840
Where is she?

1045
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Where did you see her last?

1046
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,160
I'll tell you. The last place I saw her.

1047
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,720
It was...

1048
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,840
No!

1049
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,480
Where's Ha Ram?

1050
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,360
Answer me. Where is she?

1051
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,080
I asked, "where is she?"

1052
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,640
No.

1053
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,040
No.

1054
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,640
No!

1055
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,880
Tell me.

1056
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,400
Where is Ha Ram?

1057
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,400
Tell me before you leave.

1058
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,160
(Black)

1059
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,400
His next target was Leo.

1060
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,400
How can I trust you?

1061
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,200
Everything you say is a lie.

1062
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,920
Did Oh Man Ho kill my father then?

1063
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,800
Here's the determining evidence that you talked about.

1064
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,080
Bring Ha Ram right now.

1065
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,840
I can't believe that I fell in love with a human being.

1066
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,280
You're the only one...

1067
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,920
who can make him happy and stop him from getting hurt.

1068
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,960
This can't happen.
