00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,160
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,960
Moo Gang.

3
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
I liked you because of who you are.

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,960
The one I like...

5
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,880
is you, Moo Gang.

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
What was that? This can't be his first time.

7
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
- What's wrong with his face? - Gosh.

8
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
You seem like you've aged.

9
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,680
You didn't say goodbye, did you?

10
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
What happened?

11
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
What?

12
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
What?

13
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,400
It's him.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
Why Ha Ram? Why of all people, Ha Ram?

15
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,280
No, this can't happen.

16
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,320
(Date bucket list)

17
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,720
The amusement park.

18
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,440
Going fishing near the river.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
What else?

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
Where shall we go?

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
I can't think anymore.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,240
Next on the news...

23
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Ex-president of Royeol group, Oh Chun Su, is accused of...

24
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,400
child prostitution in the past.

25
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,880
When working as an insurance agent 20 years ago,

26
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,240
he received sexual favors from minors...

27
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,920
- in return for accepting... - Mr. Oh's father?

28
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,800
- Moojin Time Mart's insurance. - Did Mr. Oh see this?

29
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,960
It must be a huge shock.

30
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,520
We have exclusively obtained the interview recordings of a victim.

31
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,800
We apologize for the low-definition imagery on the screen...

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,160
since the video is 20 years old.

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,480
Who chose you?

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
Who's that jerk behind all this?

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,400
He's the CEO...

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
of Chunsu Insurance.

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,120
Regarding this incident, the vice president is currently...

38
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,680
No, it's impossible.

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,000
Father... Father would not have done that.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
He was arrested without a warrant.

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,840
He is also accused of the freezer murder case.

42
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,160
Oh Chun Su's involvement with a minor 20 years ago...

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,880
The vice president's hidden account was also used for setting up...

44
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,840
a paper company as well and buying back Moojin Time Mart.

45
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Nam Joon Pyo from the New Country Party is allegedly involved...

46
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,520
with bribery using the money gained from the paper company.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,399
(How to Kiss)

48
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,120
Why is Mr. Oh calling again?

49
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Well.

50
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,120
I made up with Ha Rang because of this man. I'll forgive him.

51
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,960
Yes, what is it?

52
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,160
I have a favor to ask, Detective Han.

53
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
I brought him because there was nobody around.

54
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,560
I let him in since I owe you a favor.

55
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,600
Finish your conversation before someone comes.

56
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,120
This is not true, right?

57
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,560
Father didn't do such things. You know how he is, right?

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
Child prostitution?

59
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,560
This is absurd.

60
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
The film is fake, right?

61
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,040
Right?

62
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,560
Hey.

63
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,960
Who puts fake stuff in a safe box?

64
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,760
What a pathetic old man.

65
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,040
Why didn't he just throw it away...

66
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,440
instead of putting it in the safe?

67
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,720
You opened the safe yourself...

68
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,240
and gave the film to the police.

69
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,600
How do you feel revealing the dirty secrets of your father,

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
who you have always admired?

71
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,840
- I didn't know. - You also told the police...

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,920
about that watch in my room.

73
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,280
That is because you said...

74
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,480
That watch!

75
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,600
Father received that from Woo Byeong Sik as a form...

76
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,640
of bribery to keep quiet...

77
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,400
about the prostitution.

78
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,440
I didn't know that the watch was something this dirty.

79
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
I kept it well for a long time like a fool.

80
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
What?

81
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Why?

82
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,720
Are you shocked?

83
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
I'll tell you something even more shocking.

84
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I got to know it recently too.

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,560
Father even took part in the contracted murder...

86
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,720
to cover up his crime.

87
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
Wang Young Choon?

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,440
I stopped the insurance payments because I thought this was a fraud.

89
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,720
Do you want me to pay the insurance for him?

90
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,600
Just sign the paper, will you?

91
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Hurry up.

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,840
This is strange.

93
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
Young Choon?

94
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,280
The man who killed Ha Ram's father?

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,680
Why do you think father approved to give such a huge amount of money?

96
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,560
Don't you think it was to kill someone to cover up his crimes?

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,680
Oh Chun Su is the one who told Wang Young Choon to do it?

98
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,000
So how is Oh Chun Su related to Leo?

99
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
This doesn't make any sense.

100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
Why? Is it hard to believe?

101
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,160
You should think properly.

102
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,280
It's apparent that your father, whom you admired, has slept with...

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,360
a 13-year-old girl.

104
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,960
He got on his knees and begged...

105
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,880
while saying he was wrong.

106
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,880
No, this can't be true.

107
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,000
Can you imagine...

108
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,800
how shocked I was?

109
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,440
But that winter, father even brought you home.

110
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,159
You, the result of the relationship between him and our maid!

111
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,440
Say hello.

112
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,280
From now on...

113
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,840
they are your mother and brother.

114
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I...

115
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
I never thought of father as a human being.

116
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,720
You were like a horrible monster to me.

117
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
And my mother...

118
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
died from the shock.

119
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
I...

120
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
used to admire dad like you did too.

121
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
I tried my best...

122
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,960
to be a successful businessman...

123
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,920
like father.

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,080
But that company could have been gone...

125
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,760
because of what that dirty man has done.

126
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,640
He had to drag me...

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,400
into this dirty little play he has set up.

128
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,880
I tried my best to keep this company from going down!

129
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,240
I bribed so many dirty men for that!

130
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
I protected my company!

131
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,200
But what did that old man do to me?

132
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
That old man stabbed my back!

133
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,720
I am the core of this company!

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,600
That...

135
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,560
That is why father tried to cover up his crimes.

136
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,080
And is that why you killed that woman,

137
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,960
Han Ji Sook?

138
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Listen up, you stupid boy.

139
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,880
The only thing I did...

140
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,600
was to ask to kill that girl from the bar.

141
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,040
I thought something might happen to my family,

142
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
so I was out of my mind...

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,360
What about me?

144
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,800
You tried to kill me too!

145
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,440
You told that guy to bring me over to your place.

146
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,320
I said it wasn't me!

147
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,360
No matter how much I hate you,

148
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,520
I couldn't have killed my brother. How could I do that?

149
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,680
I just wanted you to go to jail for Sang Min...

150
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,080
and wrap this up quietly.

151
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,840
That is why I told you to come over. To persuade you.

152
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
Are you saying you didn't do that?

153
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,600
Don't... Don't lie to me.

154
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,960
Who else would want me dead except you?

155
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,040
Hey.

156
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,640
Isn't this your little play?

157
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
What?

158
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,640
If you accuse me to be a killer and tie me up here,

159
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
the entire company is yours.

160
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,360
What are you trying to say?

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,080
You scumbag!

162
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,840
You made this up, right?

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,280
You have set up this paper company that I'm not even aware of.

164
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,160
You made it look like it belonged to me.

165
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,760
You scumbag.

166
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,080
You set this up! You did this! You!

167
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,800
You have made father and me go through all this.

168
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,720
You have set up everything.

169
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,080
You did everything. Let go!

170
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,320
Wasn't it you?

171
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,080
It was your doing, you scumbag!

172
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,000
Stop it.

173
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,960
How could my father...

174
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,920
How could he...

175
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,440
All these people...

176
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,840
are killed by my father?

177
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,120
Even Ha Ram's father...

178
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
and Kim Joon too?

179
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,000
My father killed them all?

180
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,680
No, this can't be.

181
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,000
No...

182
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,520
It can't be true.

183
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,440
Moo Gang. What are you doing here so early?

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,840
Are you feeling okay?

185
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Did you hear the news? Our team will be a real serious crime squad now.

186
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,200
Fine, go. That rude brat.

187
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,480
Yes, this is Bong Man Sik from the Support Team...

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,280
No, Captain Bong Man Sik of the 3rd Serious Crime Squad.

189
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,440
Excuse me?

190
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,440
Gwang Gyun?

191
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,320
Oh, do you have any connections to Moojin by any chance?

192
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,560
No, I spent my entire childhood in the US.

193
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,720
Hey, didn't you say...

194
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,200
that you lived in Moojin for a while when you were young?

195
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,360
(Moojin Elementary School, Kim Woo Sik)

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,800
Woo Sik, it's Dad.

197
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,320
It's cold. Why are you out here?

198
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,120
Thanks to the video you sent,

199
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,920
I made up with Detective Han.

200
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,000
Thank you.

201
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Ha... Ha Ram.

202
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,280
My dad...

203
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,040
I saw the news.

204
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,440
By any chance,

205
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,360
your brother...

206
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,720
didn't kill your father, right?

207
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,320
A decent human wouldn't do such a thing, right?

208
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,880
I should've taken a better look back then.

209
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,640
She doesn't know about what happened to her dad and Joon yet.

211
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,440
Right. She wouldn't have come here if she knew that.

212
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
I brought some porridge. Let's go inside.

213
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,520
Where have you been? I've waited for a long time.

214
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,520
I went to see Mr. Oh.

215
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,000
I think his brother and father did something terrible.

216
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Mr. Oh seemed to be really hurt.

217
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,200
Did he say something to you?

218
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,640
He didn't say anything.

219
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,840
He must've been shocked.

220
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,360
Ha Ram.

221
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,160
Did you forget about the promise we made last night?

222
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,360
What? What promise?

223
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, that? Well...

224
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,880
The note I wrote is in my house.

225
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,200
Go get it. Now.

226
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,360
Come on.

227
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,280
Hurry.

228
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,960
What's taking her so long?

229
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,720
All right.

230
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,040
I can do it well today. Yes.

231
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,320
Moo Gang had a girlfriend. She must think it's strange.

232
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,120
All right.

233
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,600
No one is good from the beginning.

234
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,720
Let's just do it like I practiced all night.

235
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,760
Come here.

236
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,040
What are you doing?

237
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,160
I don't really look good, do I?

238
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,200
What do you mean?

239
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,600
What?

240
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,960
I look bad in these, right? I'll go back and change.

241
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,160
No, no.

242
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,320
You look good.

243
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,040
You look pretty.

244
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,080
It looks fun, right?

245
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,760
Doesn't it look fun?

246
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm tired of this.

247
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,880
I don't want to ride anything anymore.

248
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,680
I always wanted to ride these when I got a boyfriend.

249
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,520
I couldn't do it with Dong Woon since he dumped me in a week.

250
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,160
What?

251
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,000
You only went out with him for a week?

252
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,600
We dated for a week, and I saw a shadow on his mom.

253
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,000
I told him about it. Then he dumped me and said I bring misfortune.

254
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,240
Is this the place you wanted to come with your boyfriend?

255
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,080
I came here with my dad once when I was little.

256
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,840
With your dad?

257
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,960
We got lost when we were hiking through the mountains.

258
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,360
But strangely, there was an amusement park there.

259
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,720
Ha Ram. No.

260
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,400
The rescue team can't find us if we stay here, can they?

261
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,040
Let's ride it just once before we go. Please?

262
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,960
Just once.

263
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,680
I'll take you to Moojin World tomorrow.

264
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,240
There are many new attractions there. Okay?

265
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,640
But my dad didn't keep his promise.

266
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
Maybe I should say he couldn't keep it.

267
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,200
On the next day,

268
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,000
my mom left me and my dad.

269
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,400
After that day,

270
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,720
he raised me by himself.

271
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,080
He must've been too busy to take me to an amusement park.

272
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
They saw it?

273
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
Did you say...

274
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,560
there was an amusement park in the woods?

275
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,640
You can't believe it, right? Everyone says the same thing.

276
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,840
But it was really there. I definitely saw it.

277
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,560
I even went looking for it when I was older.

278
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,000
I couldn't find it though.

279
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,080
That's why I always wanted to ride these someday.

280
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,840
Let's go ride that.

281
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,640
Gosh, this will be so much fun.

282
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,640
You look scared. You're scared, right?

283
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,240
Scared? Nonsense. I'm just tired of this.

284
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,440
My gosh.

285
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,400
(Detective Park)

286
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,880
What should we ride next? Which one?

287
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,440
Is it that good?

288
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,920
It tastes fantastic.

289
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,640
Come closer for a second.

290
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,040
- What? - Come closer for a second.

291
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,520
Why?

292
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
It's sweet.

293
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
Let's ride that next. Okay?

294
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,720
Joon. Are you okay with this?

295
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,000
Is it okay if I'm happy without you?

296
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,040
(Pork Back-bone Stew)

297
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,920
Don't blame yourself.

298
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,040
Because I saved Wang Young Choon's life,

299
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,680
Lee Mi So and his wife's sister died.

300
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
I will never...

301
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,960
do anything to someone's life.

302
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,520
Think about the lives you've saved so far.

303
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,200
You saved Tiffany, her daughter, Hoon Seok, his dad,

304
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,440
the children who would've died in the container, and their parents.

305
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,000
Thanks to you, they're all alive.

306
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,680
That alone makes you praiseworthy already.

307
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,040
Here.

308
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,920
Eat this.

309
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,360
This is the reward I'm giving you for that.

310
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,720
Why did you leave Geon Young out of it?

311
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,320
You're right.

312
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,240
You saved Geon Young too.

313
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,400
I wonder if Geon Young is doing well. Maybe I should call him.

314
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,320
Eat first.

315
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
Come on.

316
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,960
Here. Open up.

317
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,560
I'll go in now.

318
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,640
Goodnight.

319
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,640
Why is it on the floor?

320
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Hey, Moo Gang. Why didn't you answer your phone all day?

321
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
What is it?

322
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
What?

323
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,480
(Na Gwang Gyun)

324
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,880
Crazy Dog.

325
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
What is it, punk?

326
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,280
Get off me! Get off!

327
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,240
Let's eat together, okay?

328
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,560
What do you expect me to do now?

329
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,480
Take care of it yourself! How ridiculous. I don't care.

330
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Those who took his soul must've had a hard time.

331
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,560
He has a bad temper.

332
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,320
He must've insisted that he doesn't want to go.

333
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,600
He might have bitten the Grim Reapers' ears.

334
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,840
I hope he didn't cause too much trouble.

335
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,880
Why do I care about just a human?

336
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,480
It's none of my business.

337
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,760
Why are you standing there like that?

338
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,680
Bow, and pay your respects.

339
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,440
Gosh, you brat.

340
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,920
You haven't eaten, right?

341
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,680
Gui Nam, stay here.

342
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,280
Okay.

343
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,840
Let's go and eat.

344
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,760
Come on.

345
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,040
What kind of a crazy jerk brought toothbrushes to a funeral?

346
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,960
Why on earth did he drink and drive?

347
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,280
I'm sure...

348
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,720
Gwang Gyun's car was parked at the barbecue restaurant.

349
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,200
Gosh, was I mistaken?

350
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,800
How can you be eating right now?

351
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,400
Hey. Does it taste that good? Does it?

352
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,160
Your team causes only trouble every time.

353
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,160
How could a police officer drink and drive?

354
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,400
I knew it when he was wildly running around to catch Oh Man Ho.

355
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,440
All right. Let's have your funeral today too.

356
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,200
- You punk! - Hey!

357
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,160
Please stop, Captain Bong.

358
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,240
That jerk!

359
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,320
- How dare you! - Please stop.

360
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
If they mess with my boys,

361
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,800
I would even investigate the Blue House. How dare they?

362
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,200
A presidential candidate? Do you think he'd scare me?

363
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,880
You're right. If they mess with Moo Gang,

364
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,800
I'll destroy them even if it's the Blue House or the White House.

365
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,080
- Get off me! - Please stop.

366
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,200
- My goodness. - What's wrong with you?

367
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
- That's enough. - Please stop now.

368
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,200
Stop it already.

369
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,800
Stop.

370
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,640
Stop it!

371
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,400
If you mess with my team,

372
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,240
I'll make you regret it.

373
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,920
Even if it's the Blue House or the White House,

374
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,160
I'll kill them all if they mess with my team.

375
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,240
What's the matter with Moo Gang now?

376
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,960
That's what I said in the toilet. Gwang Gyun...

377
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,960
- My Gosh. - Captain Bong.

378
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,120
- Calm down. Calm down. - I'll kill him.

379
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
Moo Gang.

380
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,520
What is it? Is something wrong?

381
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,040
Crazy Dog died.

382
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,400
Crazy Dog?

383
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,440
Oh, the detective we saw in Moojin?

384
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,320
Yes.

385
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,000
What happened?

386
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,000
It looks like he drove drunk.

387
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,480
His car fell off from a bridge under construction.

388
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,880
I wonder what this feeling is.

389
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,360
Am I sad?

390
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,680
Why am I sad?

391
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,800
You must be sad.

392
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
Of course you are.

393
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,760
Sadness.

394
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,320
I don't like this.

395
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,920
What are you doing?

396
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,960
Stay away from my daughter.

397
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,640
Who are you?

398
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,640
Are... Are you Ha Ram's mother?

399
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,880
Stay away from my daughter, you darn Grim Reaper.

400
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,240
What?

401
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,000
Stay away from my daughter! Stay away from her!

402
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,120
Get lost.

403
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,840
Fine. Then I'll go to Ha Ram and tell her who you really are.

404
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,360
You're a human. How can you...

405
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,280
You may fool my daughter, but not me.

406
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,080
I won't let you fool me again.

407
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,160
What?

408
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,200
Ha Ram!

409
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,600
Honey!

410
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,400
We will search this area, so please wait here.

411
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,440
Why did he go hiking with her?

412
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,640
Dad!

413
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
- Help me! - Ha Ram!

414
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,680
Dad. Dad!

415
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,840
- It's okay. - Dad!

416
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,120
Hold on to my hand, will you?

417
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,840
Dad!

418
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,360
Dad.

419
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,760
It's okay.

420
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,160
Dad.

421
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,080
Honey.

422
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
What's that on your neck?

423
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,520
On your neck...

424
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,920
What's that on your neck?

425
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,800
The hideous thing on his neck I saw that day.

426
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,680
I saw it on you too.

427
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,400
I won't let my daughter have a miserable life like me.

428
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Get away from my daughter now.

429
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,160
No.

430
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,960
- What? - I said no.

431
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,200
Do you think she will still like you if she finds out who you are?

432
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,240
I loved her dad too.

433
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,880
But after I found out about who he is,

434
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,640
I ran away without turning back...

435
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
because it was scary and creepy.

436
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,880
Even when he came to my house with Ha Ram,

437
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,480
and when Ha Ram told me that he was going to die,

438
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,360
I just left him to die.

439
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,200
Do you think Ha Ram wouldn't do the same?

440
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,600
Let's go to her now and reveal who you are.

441
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,080
Then see how she reacts yourself.

442
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
Come on. Let's go.

443
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,280
Don't you dare tell Ha Ram about this. I dare you.

444
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,200
If you do, I'll kill her...

445
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
and take her to the underworld myself.

446
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,680
I have no intention of doing something with a human,

447
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,920
so just wait quietly.

448
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,800
I'll leave when I need to leave.

449
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,600
Why?

450
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,320
Why did she...

451
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,400
Why did she have to take after my fate too?

452
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,320
Ha Ram...

453
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Ha Ram, what should I do?

454
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,560
Why do you look so absent-minded again?

455
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,560
By any chance, did you...

456
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
kiss her again?

457
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,480
You punk.

458
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,760
What is it?

459
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,520
Who is...

460
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,160
Kang Ha Ram's dad?

461
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Who is Kang Soo Hyuk?

462
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,360
You knew everything, didn't you?

463
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,000
What... What do you mean?

464
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,480
Tell me.

465
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,000
Explain to me!

466
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,640
I already know that Ha Ram's dad was a Grim Reaper.

467
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,160
What? He was a Grim Reaper?

468
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,080
Really?

469
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,480
Explain to me.

470
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,520
444.

471
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,320
What?

472
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,880
He was the previous 444.

473
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,880
He was the 444 of the previous generation of Grim Reapers.

474
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,040
He was a lot more coldhearted than you are.

475
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,840
He was probably the best 444 among all generations.

476
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,600
Then why did he end up in a human being's body?

477
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,280
That day,

478
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,040
he was out collecting souls on his own...

479
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,200
because his partner had to be somewhere else.

480
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm so happy.

481
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,640
Honey.

482
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,280
Honey, no.

483
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,040
No. Honey, no!

484
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,960
No, please don't die. Honey.

485
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,160
Honey. No!

486
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,800
He ended up staring into the eyes of that bride.

487
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,680
He forgot that he wasn't allowed to look into the eyes...

488
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,960
of a human being that was in love.

489
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,760
At that moment,

490
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,960
he ended up falling for her.

491
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,800
So are you saying Ha Ram...

492
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,400
is the daughter of a human being and a Grim Reaper?

493
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,880
I mean, is she half human and half Grim Reaper?

494
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,560
Is that why she could see us?

495
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,960
Ha Ram could see us...

496
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,000
just like how we could see each other.

497
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,560
But because she's half human, so she can't see us clearly.

498
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,800
It seems like she can only see a vague silhouette.

499
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,880
No wonder.

500
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,480
I guess that's why her wounds always healed so quickly.

501
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,240
Then how can she foresee the moment of people's deaths?

502
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,720
We don't have the ability to do that.

503
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,200
I think the power of a human and a Grim Reaper...

504
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,040
met together and brought out a greater synergy effect.

505
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,440
Humans call that evolution.

506
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,360
Then...

507
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,880
what happened to that 444 who stayed in Kang Soo Hyuk's body?

508
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,080
He would've exited that body when Wang Young Choon pushed him.

509
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,760
Did the Death Squad take him?

510
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,080
I guess he's still locked up in the dungeon.

511
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,240
He perished.

512
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,440
He perished?

513
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,000
What?

514
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,960
He perished just because he fell in love with a human being?

515
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,800
I thought that only happened when we harmed humans.

516
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,639
Isn't that supposed to be the worst punishment?

517
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,280
He killed a human being.

518
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm going to kill your wife and child like my brother!

519
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,560
Humans call that self-defense and can avoid getting punished.

520
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,920
But that kind of thing doesn't exist in our world.

521
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,400
He loved that woman so much.

522
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,120
But once she found out who he was,

523
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,560
she ended up running away without even looking back.

524
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,880
You should think carefully.

525
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,120
Ha Ram's mother and the Grim Reaper inside Kang Soo Hyuk's body...

526
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,560
were both madly in love just like you and Ha Ram.

527
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,320
You better keep this in mind. You're the future...

528
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,680
of the Grim Reaper that was in Kang Soo Hyuk's body.

529
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,720
I'm not like that fool.

530
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,320
I can't believe he got himself perished because of a human being.

531
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,880
That's not even funny.

532
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,360
I can't believe that weakling was a 444.

533
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,720
What an embarrassment.

534
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,680
I'm going to leave as soon as I find that loser.

535
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,960
I'm not going to have any regrets.

536
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,480
What's so hard about that?

537
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,200
Ha Ram is not special to me at all.

538
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,640
Right. You're not Han Moo Gang. You're 444.

539
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,560
You're just temporarily staying in Han Moo Gang's body.

540
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,520
You're just living in his body for a while, okay?

541
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,800
You just need to enjoy the emotions of a human being while you're here.

542
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
That's all you need to do.

543
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,160
I was being too lazy about finding that loser lately.

544
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,240
Okay.

545
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,760
I should find my gun first.

546
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,040
Yes.

547
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,280
That's right.

548
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,800
(Seoun Police Station)

549
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,240
Why would you interfere with our team's investigation?

550
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,160
Your team has a bad reputation because of Gwang Gyun's death.

551
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,200
And there are only three people on your team now.

552
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,280
You're not getting any more reinforcements either.

553
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
What are you talking about? There are four members in total.

554
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,880
I'm all good now.

555
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,200
What? Can't you believe me?

556
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,640
Okay, okay.

557
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm all good now.

558
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,040
Hey, I'm going to start working again today, so give me my gun.

559
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,880
I can't believe he's asking for his gun again.

560
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,480
Sir, I'm not going to stand still if you let him work again.

561
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,640
That punk.

562
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,760
- You did nothing right either. - What did you say, you jerk?

563
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
You little... I can't believe that jerk.

564
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,880
- Calm down. - That little...

565
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,160
Fine. The press is waiting outside because of Royeol right now.

566
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,880
Should I tell them what you said?

567
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,760
Should I tell them that police...

568
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,320
said that the victim deserved to die? Do you want that?

569
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,680
When did I say that?

570
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,640
"When"?

571
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,400
I accidentally pressed the wrong button...

572
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,040
and ended up recording every single word you said, okay?

573
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,080
If you don't want me to reveal this to the press, give me my gun.

574
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,520
My gosh, do whatever you want. My goodness, that jerk.

575
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,920
My gosh.

576
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,120
Okay, fine.

577
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,680
I'll tell them everything.

578
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,720
- My gosh. - Stop it.

579
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,320
- What are you doing? - Calm down.

580
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,880
- I'll tell them everything. - That's enough.

581
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,840
- Stop it. - Okay, okay.

582
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,720
Your team needed some help anyway. You can start working.

583
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,440
Your holidays are over now. Are you happy?

584
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,080
Captain Lee, come over here, and apologize.

585
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,160
Hey, I don't need an apology. Just give me my gun.

586
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,880
- Hurry. - Just give him his gun.

587
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,760
Give him his detective ID card and his gun.

588
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,880
Hurry up!

589
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,120
Here.

590
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,640
All right. We need to team up at times like this...

591
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,600
and finish the investigation, okay?

592
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,880
Cheer up.

593
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,800
Hey, where are you going?

594
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm going to see Leo.

595
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,120
"Leo"?

596
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,520
Hey, are you going to see what his relationship is with Oh Man Ho?

597
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,080
Okay! You can go!

598
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,120
What was that about?

599
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,320
Great.

600
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,920
I'm going to leave as soon as I find that loser.

601
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,760
I'm 444, okay?

602
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,440
I'm the coldhearted 444.

603
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,160
Yes.

604
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,120
- Ha Ram is just Ha Ram. - Detective Han.

605
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,560
I hope...

606
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,920
I'll be able to leave.

607
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,680
- Hey. - You're here.

608
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,840
Let's go.

609
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,440
Okay. Ready, action.

610
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,040
But what are we doing here?

611
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,880
Why did you want me to come here?

612
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,520
Look around, and see if there's a guy with a shadow nearby.

613
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,680
What?

614
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,320
I said I don't want to do this anymore.

615
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,840
I said I will no longer try to save anyone.

616
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,280
I never asked you to save anyone.

617
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm just saying you should see if anyone has a shadow or not.

618
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,560
No one has a shadow. I'm going to go now.

619
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,680
Cut.

620
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,000
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

621
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,280
What's wrong?

622
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,480
Is this a lovers' quarrel?

623
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,000
- Get ready for the next scene. - Everyone, get ready.

624
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Mind your own business.

625
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,880
Please get ready.

626
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,920
By the way, I heard that a detective in your team died.

627
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
Did he really drive drunk?

628
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Yes.

629
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,800
Let me ask you something.

630
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,440
Did you see...

631
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,120
anyone weird around you lately?

632
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,480
Were there any kind of stalkers?

633
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,480
- No, there weren't any. - Really?

634
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,280
Does that mean I wasted my time on nothing?

635
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,600
I didn't know those letters were from Wang Young Choon.

636
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,400
Gosh, where is this loser hiding?

637
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,920
Did you find out...

638
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,960
why Wang Young Choon was after me?

639
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,520
Oh, right. Captain Bong asked me to ask you something.

640
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,720
I guess I'll just ask then. What's your relationship with Oh Man Ho?

641
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,920
Oh Man Ho?

642
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,560
We're not that close. He's just a brother of my friend, Man Soo.

643
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,680
Really?

644
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,600
Then why was Wang Young Choon after you?

645
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,760
Why are you asking me? It's your job to find out.

646
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,920
Father even took part in the contracted murder.

647
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,200
Oh Man Ho thinks Oh Chun Su was behind everything.

648
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,760
But why would Oh Chun Su kill Lee Mi So and go after Leo?

649
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,520
That makes no sense.

650
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,360
Do you know Oh Chun Su?

651
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,120
Man Soo's dad?

652
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,120
I never really met him in person. Why do you ask?

653
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,960
Really?

654
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,600
What's this?

655
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,200
Does that mean it was neither Oh Chun Su nor Oh Man Ho?

656
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,320
Leo, you need to start shooting your next scene.

657
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,680
Hurry up, and come here.

658
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,720
By the way, are you really sure your colleague died...

659
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,200
because he drove drunk?

660
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,040
What?

661
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,520
My gosh, where in this world is that loser?

662
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,440
I thought of him too easily.

663
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,840
I can't believe he didn't even show up...

664
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,200
before his family, Leo, or his ex-girlfriend.

665
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,400
Why is he so fickle?

666
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Moo Gang.

667
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,360
Are you mad?

668
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,360
- I was just trying to... - Joon used to...

669
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,360
- listen to this all the time. - What?

670
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,720
Would you give it a try and listen?

671
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,080
What?

672
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,920
What's this? I don't like this kind of music.

673
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,080
It's too sad.

674
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,000
Moo Gang.

675
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,960
I actually came here to tell you...

676
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
about this guy that I've recently started to like.

677
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,680
He's your younger brother.

678
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,320
Is that okay?

679
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,280
I heard...

680
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,800
that you used to care for him so much.

681
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,360
If only that shadow appeared...

682
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,800
just a little earlier than it did that day,

683
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,520
I would've been able to save him.

684
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,840
I actually saw him that day.

685
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,160
- It's been four days since... - Okay, bye.

686
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,680
the collapse of Moojin Time Mart.

687
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,440
Almost 300 people have been confirmed to have died already.

688
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,800
Seung Chul.

689
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,280
I told you not to go to the movie theater.

690
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,960
Why didn't you listen to me?

691
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,920
- Ha Ram, Joon came today. - He's here?

692
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,560
- He's in town? - Yes.

693
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
I guess he came because he was worried about me.

694
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,120
I wonder if he heard anything about Seung Chul.

695
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,480
He bought a birthday card here.

696
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,960
A birthday card?

697
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,520
It's been a while since my birthday passed.

698
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,440
Where did he go to?

699
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,520
He said he was going to go to a restaurant to see a girl.

700
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,200
"A girl"?

701
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,840
Could it be her?

702
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,360
He should've visited me first.

703
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,240
It's Joon.

704
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,520
Joon didn't have a shadow on him.

705
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,760
I should've followed him around back then.

706
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,400
But I was too focused...

707
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,240
on the shadow I saw on my dad that day.

708
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,280
What?

709
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,440
After I saw Joon,

710
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,800
I went back home.

711
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,280
Dad.

712
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,360
Dad.

713
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,640
That... That shadow...

714
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,280
It's okay. I'll be right back.

715
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,480
No, don't go.

716
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,960
Don't worry. I'm not going to die.

717
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,040
I'll be right back after I catch the bad guy.

718
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,480
No! Dad, don't go!

719
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,000
Don't go!

720
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,600
You can't go!

721
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
No, Dad! Don't go!

722
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,120
I tried so hard...

723
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,600
to get rid of that shadow so I could save him.

724
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,480
But it was useless.

725
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,920
My dad ended up getting murdered...

726
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,880
by Wang Young Choon just like what I foresaw.

727
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,840
I killed Ha Ram's dad because he told me to.

728
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,440
Yes.

729
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,840
She's better off not knowing.

730
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,600
Anyway, Oh Man Ho's in prison now. Everything's over.

731
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,040
Don't ever leave me...

732
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,080
like my dad or Joon.

733
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,400
Goodbye then.

734
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,080
See you.

735
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,560
I loved her dad too.

736
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,320
But when I found out who he was,

737
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,120
I ran away without turning back...

738
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,320
because it was scary and creepy.

739
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,240
I wish I was a human being.

740
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,160
My gosh. I can't believe I'm jealous of humans,

741
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,480
which I looked down upon so much.

742
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,760
Ha Ram.

743
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,360
I'm scared now.

744
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,160
The infamous 444 is in fear.

745
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,120
What's this?

746
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,960
Is this what humans call a guitar?

747
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,000
What if

748
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,760
What is this?

749
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:58,240
What if I were sky

750
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,200
I want to be colored on your face

751
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:16,000
Like that red sunset in the evening

752
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,600
I want to be colored on your cheek

753
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,120
What is this?

754
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,560
I can play the guitar too.

755
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,840
Did Kim Joon teach me because I'm his brother?

756
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,560
What are you doing over there?

757
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,520
You're here.

758
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,400
What about him?

759
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,440
He's next to the soul he was newly assigned to.

760
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,160
Do you have anything that worries you?

761
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,600
Haven't you found out?

762
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,720
What?

763
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,080
The reason why I can't get out of this body.

764
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,400
Not yet.

765
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,480
Call me tomorrow when you exchange souls.

766
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,640
- What? - I don't want to do this anymore.

767
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,520
Call me tomorrow, so I can leave immediately...

768
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,240
after I say goodbye to Ha Ram.

769
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,960
What are you saying? Are you going to turn yourself in?

770
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,520
You were trying so hard to find the criminal.

771
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,520
Don't you care if you become a dog?

772
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,640
If I don't leave now, I can't leave her forever.

773
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,280
And I can't stay in this body forever too.

774
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,120
Ha Ram will find out in the end.

775
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,160
Just like how it was for her parents.

776
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,840
I can still remember her mom's eyes.

777
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,200
Her eyes were full of despair because she was hurt.

778
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,240
I can't let Ha Ram live the rest of her life because of me.

779
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,880
Can you leave her...

780
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,960
without any regrets?

781
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,200
So let's just say that Father...

782
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,520
was who instigated Wang Young Chun 20 years ago. And Han Jin Sook?

783
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,800
Did my brother really order the murder of Han Jin Sook?

784
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,280
I don't think that's true.

785
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,720
Then who is it?

786
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,720
Man Soo.

787
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,600
Why are you here?

788
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,360
Are you okay? I saw the news.

789
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,680
I was really worried.

790
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,720
What?

791
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,400
What did you say the other day?

792
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,000
Goodness.

793
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,080
That shadow again.

794
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,280
I can never get used to it.

795
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,520
Who is the person talking to Mr. Oh?

796
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,120
Ha Ram! Ha Ram saw us.

797
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,440
She can see us!

798
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,080
We're here!

799
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,600
Be quiet, you punk.

800
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,320
Get out of my sight.

801
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,320
Don't you ever come and see me.

802
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,880
Man Soo.

803
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,480
She touched me. She just touched me.

804
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,840
Be quiet. You crazy kid.

805
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,480
Darn it. I never get used to it.

806
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,520
She didn't touch you. You touched her. You brat.

807
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,240
I think she saw how she died.

808
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,480
She won't stay quiet about this.

809
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,160
She'll ask Black to help and save her, right?

810
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,240
All right! Yes!

811
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,880
Mr. Oh.

812
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,480
Have you eaten?

813
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,960
I have brought you some abalone porridge.

814
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,760
Why don't you try it?

815
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,480
Why are you here again? I'm tired.

816
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,280
You should get back to your senses during times like this.

817
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,880
I went to a fish market early this morning to make this porridge.

818
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,880
Can you eat it for my sake? It took me quite some time.

819
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,280
Okay?

820
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,360
I'll go now.

821
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,080
By the way,

822
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,720
who is that woman you talked with a while ago?

823
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,000
She's not your mother, is she?

824
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,600
I think...

825
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,160
she will commit suicide.

826
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,880
Suicide?

827
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,400
All right.

828
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,520
Ha Ram, I have something to tell you.

829
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,000
I don't think this detective job is my thing.

830
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,720
So I'm going back to the US.

831
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,200
All right.

832
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,000
Thank you for everything.

833
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,760
Goodbye.

834
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,360
I hope you meet a nice guy.

835
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,960
Bye.

836
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,560
Yes, I have to say it in a cool way like this.

837
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,000
What is this?

838
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,000
Is this causing the reflection?

839
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,800
What is this?

840
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,280
He was watching Moo Gang's house?

841
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,280
What is all this?

842
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,560
Who is this man?

843
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,160
Detective Han.

844
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,760
The police told him to go somewhere safe.

845
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,280
I will go to your house...

846
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,880
since my house is on a rooftop and doesn't have much protection.

847
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,160
He was eavesdropping on her too?

848
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,160
Who is this jerk?

849
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,480
Oh Man Ho will be done with soon.

850
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,880
Gwang Gyun is known to be dead from driving drunk as well.

851
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,760
The problem is that jerk, Han Moo Gang's informant.

852
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,720
He will show up soon if I keep watching Han Moo Gang.

853
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,520
Yes, sir.

854
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,000
Who was it?

855
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,960
Who are you talking to?

856
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,440
So you were that fingerless guy.

857
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,000
Who are you?

858
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,440
You jerk.

859
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,040
Hello?

860
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,960
What? You found Lee Byeong Tae?

861
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,160
In an orphanage?

862
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
Stop!

863
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,360
Yes. He stayed at our orphanage for about two years...

864
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,680
after his grandmother passed away.

865
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,760
Then he went to the States.

866
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,680
He came to say hello last year when he came back to Korea.

867
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,560
Did he leave you his number by any chance?

868
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,040
I don't have his number.

869
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,760
Then do you have a photo?

870
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,200
Let's see.

871
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,160
He came on sports day.

872
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,520
So he might've taken a photo with the kids.

873
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,200
Just a second.

874
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,160
Here it is.

875
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,400
Why is he still spying on Han Moo Gang?

876
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,360
Is there really someone else behind this other than Oh Man Ho?

877
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,920
Moo Gang was so obsessed about catching Wang Young Choon,

878
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,400
so that must mean that he got his memory back.

879
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,440
But if he did,

880
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,200
he would've called me already. I wonder why he's not calling.

881
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,840
Moo Gang. Moo Gang.

882
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,920
I'm going to reveal that videotape if you kill Moo Gang.

883
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,640
I'll stay hidden...

884
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,480
if you leave him alone.

885
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,560
So do what you wish.

886
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,360
Okay.

887
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,720
I'll give him a shot then.

888
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,200
It's that jerk.

889
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,200
I shouldn't have called him with my restaurant's number.

890
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,880
He killed Crazy Dog, Joon,

891
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,600
Han Moo Gang, and Ha Ram's dad.

892
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,680
And he's a scary guy who even tore apart Mr. Oh's family.

893
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,160
If Ha Ram ends up finding out that her dad...

894
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,800
was actually murdered by someone else,

895
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,080
she's obviously going to want to catch the culprit.

896
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,280
And I'll no longer be here then.

897
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,680
Fine.

898
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,440
I'll leave right after I catch this jerk.

899
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,200
I think he ran away.

900
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,000
He ran away?

901
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,880
He'll never show up here...

902
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,960
if he finds out that he's being chased.

903
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,600
I'm sure he will go into hiding.

904
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,000
Clara, Kim Joon, and Kang Soo Hyuk.

905
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,600
They all died 20 years ago.

906
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,080
Wang Young Choon.

907
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,080
Lee Mi So.

908
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,840
His sister-in-law.

909
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,840
His sister-in-law's ex-husband and his wife.

910
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,720
Han Jin Sook.

911
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,640
Han Moo Gang.

912
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,480
The director of the mental hospital.

913
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,880
The special forces soldier.

914
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,040
Chief of Moojin Police Station.

915
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,080
Seung Chul's parents.

916
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,600
Woo Byung Sik.

917
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,360
Oh Chun Su.

918
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,840
Crazy Dog.

919
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,800
And Oh Man Ho.

920
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,520
Now, I'll exclude everyone...

921
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,360
that Wang Young Choon murdered because of his personal grudge.

922
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,160
Lee Mi So.

923
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,680
His sister-in-law.

924
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,880
His sister-in-law's ex-husband and his wife.

925
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,160
The director of the mental hospital.

926
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,840
And Wang Young Choon was killed by Captain Lee.

927
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,840
That means that jerk...

928
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,880
killed everyone else.

929
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:23,520
20 years ago, he used Wang Young Choon to kill Clara.

930
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,240
Then he killed Kim Joon who witnessed that back then.

931
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,080
And according to Wang Young Choon's testimony,

932
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,320
he ended up killing Kang Soo Hyuk for some reason as well.

933
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,200
Are you talking about Ha Ram's dad?

934
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,360
Yes.

935
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,920
Now,

936
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,080
after 20 years,

937
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,280
he killed Han Jin Sook because she threatened him...

938
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,080
with what had happened 20 years ago.

939
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,200
And he killed Han Moo Gang...

940
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,840
for finding out what happened while he was investigating Joon's death.

941
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,280
Then he killed that soldier for trying to speak the truth.

942
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,720
I can assume that he killed the chief of Moojin Police Station...

943
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,960
because he was aware of who Han Jin Sook was.

944
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,000
And he killed Seung Chul's parents for finding out...

945
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
that Woo Byung Sik was still alive.

946
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,960
When Woo Byung Sik's photos were unexpectedly released,

947
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:17,040
he probably killed Woo Byung Sik to cover up what happened.

948
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,200
I can't believe Seung Chul...

949
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,640
Then he thought of Oh Chun Su as a traitor...

950
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,280
for revealing the videotape to the police and killed him.

951
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,920
Now,

952
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,240
I thought Oh Man Ho...

953
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,320
did all this in order to cover up for his father's wrongdoings.

954
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,080
But it wasn't him.

955
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,080
It was him.

956
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,280
There's one more watch.

957
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,040
The first watch we found was Woo Byung Sik's watch, number two.

958
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,080
And the second was Oh Man Ho's watch, number one.

959
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,880
We thought there were only two watches until now.

960
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,640
But there's one more watch.

961
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,040
This watch, which is number three.

962
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,480
Who could this guy be?

963
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,080
Gwang Gyun is known to be dead from driving drunk as well.

964
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,520
I'm sorry, Moo Gang.

965
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,600
I can't do this anymore.

966
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,240
I'm tired.

967
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,120
I want to stop now.

968
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,800
Crazy Dog disappeared after saying he was going to go to the toilet.

969
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:54,200
Where did he suddenly disappear to?

970
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,040
There's no CCTV in this area.

971
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,840
Yes, I remember him.

972
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,640
He told me to drop him off at Seoun Police Station.

973
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,040
He went to Seoun Police Station?

974
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,880
What is he looking at?

975
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,800
That's right. Gwang Gyun called me that night.

976
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,960
What did he say?

977
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,319
He asked for information on a case from 20 years ago.

978
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,040
I meant to send it early the next morning.

979
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,960
But I didn't send it when I heard about what happened to him.

980
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,560
Take a look.

981
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,160
What is this?

982
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,200
What is this?

983
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,840
I'm not sure.

984
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,640
Did you find any fingerprints?

985
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,520
I told you.

986
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,480
It's impossible to find them after 20 years.

987
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Is that so?

988
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,640
Don't be so disappointed.

989
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,840
Look at this.

990
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,200
Surprisingly, I found them here.

991
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,280
Sometimes, it's possible to detect...

992
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,640
fingerprints on plastic with vacuum metal deposition.

993
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,000
So I gave it a try.

994
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,040
I'm sorry, Joon.

995
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,440
When you died because of me,

996
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,600
if I had been brave...

997
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,480
or died with you,

998
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,360
Moo Gang wouldn't be in danger like now.

999
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,240
So many people wouldn't have died either.

1000
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,200
Joon.

1001
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,000
I'm...

1002
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,560
I'm exhausted now. I want to let go of everything.

1003
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,160
Can I...

1004
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,480
join you now?

1005
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,960
No.

1006
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,320
You can't die yet.

1007
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,360
Moo Gang.

1008
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,200
I have something to ask you.

1009
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,400
Kim Sun Young.

1010
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,640
Are your memories back?

1011
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,880
Your fingerprints were found at the site.

1012
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,840
Is it for your boyfriend?

1013
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:50,520
No, it's for a friend. He's going to Seoul tomorrow.

1014
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,400
He has an old guitar, so I wanted to buy him a new one.

1015
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,240
But I don't have enough money.

1016
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,480
Then how about a guitar pick?

1017
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,040
Many people buy them as gifts.

1018
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,920
A guitar pick?

1019
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,960
You're Sun Young, Joon's first love.

1020
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,080
You found me in the end.

1021
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,040
I did.

1022
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,680
I found...

1023
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,440
both you and him.

1024
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,320
What?

1025
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,880
Who do you mean?

1026
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,080
The one who's to be blamed for everything.

1027
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,280
All of this was done by him?

1028
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,600
Why did he kill so many people?

1029
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,640
It started because of this.

1030
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,960
This is...

1031
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,160
20 years ago,

1032
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,120
the police received a report.

1033
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,280
And a police officer went to investigate.

1034
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,920
Crazy Dog received a report on sexual assault.

1035
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,520
It's okay. Calm down.

1036
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,840
- Tell me what's going on. - I...

1037
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,720
I was raped...

1038
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,240
- by... - Get out here!

1039
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,360
That woman said...

1040
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,920
that she'll come after me if I report it.

1041
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,200
I was afraid that I'd be arrested for underage prostitution too.

1042
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,240
That's why I couldn't report it.

1043
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,080
The owner of this keychain.

1044
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,320
It's him, isn't it?

1045
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,720
He raped you, right?

1046
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,160
I think...

1047
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,320
I told you everything.

1048
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,520
I see.

1049
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,160
Okay.

1050
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,640
Wait. Let me change the videotape.

1051
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,480
I'll ask you one last question.

1052
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,200
Where was the place of prostitution?

1053
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,280
I'm not sure.

1054
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,120
They always took me in a car.

1055
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,000
I think it was a mountain cabin.

1056
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,120
Really?

1057
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,240
Are we done? I have to clean and do laundry before others arrive.

1058
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,320
I'll come with you. Wait.

1059
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,400
By the way,

1060
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,520
how much...

1061
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,960
did you get paid?

1062
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,360
Pardon me?

1063
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,480
It was...

1064
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,120
I can pay you that much, you know.

1065
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,360
Pardon?

1066
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,160
Mister... Mister.

1067
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,120
What's wrong? I'll pay you.

1068
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,520
Do it with me, will you?

1069
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,200
What's wrong?

1070
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,480
I'll pay you.

1071
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,640
How dare you act expensive?

1072
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,200
- Come here. - No way.

1073
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:39,520
- Gosh. - No, let me go! Stop.

1074
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,440
Let me go. No!

1075
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,080
If you report this,

1076
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,920
I'll send you off to an island.

1077
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,080
Compared to that, this is a paradise.

1078
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,080
In that case,

1079
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,400
is that the videotape he was searching for?

1080
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,600
When he raped me, it was accidentally...

1081
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,120
caught on video.

1082
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,240
Then where's that videotape now?

1083
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,880
I don't know.

1084
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,160
However...

1085
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,320
You wench.

1086
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,280
Where's the videotape?

1087
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,520
It's over here.

1088
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,880
- Joon. Joon! - Joon.

1089
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,840
Joon... Joon. Joon!

1090
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,560
Joon!

1091
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,800
No!

1092
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,880
No!

1093
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,640
All this time, I thought...

1094
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,240
Kim Young Seok killed Joon and took the videotape.

1095
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,800
Until Jin Sook called Young Seok...

1096
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,280
to suggest that they meet since she has the videotape.

1097
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,840
However, it was he who came.

1098
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,640
Gosh. Where's that darn tape?

1099
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,480
Why didn't the camera turn off back then?

1100
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,880
Why did that kid have to get involved as well?

1101
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,200
Darn it.

1102
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,720
You may come now, sir.

1103
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,480
Okay, let's go.

1104
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,720
So that videotape...

1105
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:28,600
is the only evidence for Young Seok's murder.

1106
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,960
But did he really kill that many people just to find that tape?

1107
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,680
For Young Seok,

1108
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,360
that tape can destroy his life once and for all.

1109
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,400
To expose his crime,

1110
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,160
we must find it first.

1111
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,600
You must remember.

1112
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,280
Moo Gang.

1113
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,880
You definitely know where the tape is.

1114
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,000
- I do? - On the day of the accident,

1115
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,360
you left me a voice message.

1116
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,080
At that time,

1117
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,880
I couldn't answer because of an urgent patient.

1118
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,120
Soo Wan, if I reveal the truth,

1119
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,240
you'll be...

1120
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,800
(The day of Nine PM hostage incident)

1121
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,400
extremely hurt.

1122
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,960
However, I can't forgive him for what he did to my brother.

1123
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,600
I'm sorry, Soo Wan.

1124
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,560
But please know this.

1125
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,080
My feelings for you...

1126
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,960
were real.

1127
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,560
Okay.

1128
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,560
Let's talk when everything is over. I'm sorry.

1129
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,560
You were out of touch for a month. This is the last voice message...

1130
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,640
that you left me on the day of the accident.

1131
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,920
Before the accident,

1132
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,400
you must have known where the tape was.

1133
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,240
Try to remember.

1134
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,880
You must remember it. Please, Moo Gang.

1135
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,720
I can't remember it.

1136
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,640
Thank you all for coming.

1137
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,320
I'm here today...

1138
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,600
to prevent a tragedy like the Moojin Time Mart incident from reoccurring.

1139
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,200
I'm running for the presidency...

1140
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,840
to guarantee national security and to break the ties...

1141
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,040
between politics and business.

1142
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,800
I'm running my presidential campaign here,

1143
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:30,440
where those who died during the Moojin Time Mart incident are,

1144
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,440
because I'm determined to reveal the truth...

1145
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,800
of what happened that day.

1146
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,640
A great man like him should be the president. Of course.

1147
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,200
(Congressman Kim Young Seok runs for the presidency...)

1148
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,280
You must...

1149
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,640
You must stop him no matter what.

1150
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,960
Did Moo Gang really find that tape?

1151
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,040
Where could it be?

1152
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,000
Moo Gang.

1153
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,080
A child fortune-teller took it.

1154
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,960
Ha Ram.

1155
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,640
Were you the one who had it?

1156
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,120
(Black)

1157
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,200
So are you saying that the culprit, who killed all these people,

1158
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,880
wasn't Oh Man Ho, but Kim Young Seok?

1159
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,200
It's likely that he knows where the tape is.

1160
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,920
I finally found him, but I lost him.

1161
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,840
Getting your memories back will be the fastest way possible.

1162
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,480
Are you upset with me?

1163
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,200
I'll get rid of everything and leave.

1164
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,600
Are you really leaving?

1165
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,760
Moo Gang, did you get your memories back?

1166
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,240
I found the tape. I'll go get it.

1167
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,840
You didn't have to kill my brother!

1168
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,400
Everything is over now, Ha Ram.
