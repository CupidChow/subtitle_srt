00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,120
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,000
- Hey, pull over for a second. - What's going on?

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,360
- Pull over for a second. - Do you need to relieve yourself?

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,960
No, just pull over.

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,480
Gwang Gyun, where are you going?

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,240
- Gosh... - Hey!

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,080
Gwang Gyun, where are you going? Why... What?

8
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
What?

9
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,520
Woo Byung Sik is still alive?

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,720
Hang on.

11
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,600
Could it be that Woo Byung Sik was the killer of Han Jin Sook?

12
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
What?

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
What just happened? Where did he go?

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,280
(Honey, you must've resented me a lot.)

15
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
(I'm sorry. I couldn't believe that Woo Byung Sik died.)

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,640
What is that?

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,600
When Moojin Time Mart collapsed,

18
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,680
were you there too?

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Of course.

20
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
300 people died.

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
All of us were there back then.

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
Everyone was exhausted after that job.

23
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,079
Collecting that many souls at once...

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,240
is definitely not an easy job.

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,280
Plus, most of the souls were kids.

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
Kids who didn't know why they had to die.

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
Kids who had so many days to live ahead.

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,720
Collecting souls of kids,

29
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,360
who were full of dreams about their future,

30
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,480
obviously couldn't have been easy.

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,680
But not a single person took responsibility for their deaths?

32
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,560
Why are you asking about Moojin Time Mart out of the blue?

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,200
Were you at the place that was on the news earlier?

34
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,840
Did the loser show up there?

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,280
No.

36
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,880
Ha Ram tried to save someone's life again.

37
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Does that mean...

38
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,280
she tried to save that man and woman's lives?

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
So...

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,720
they died because you interfered.

41
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,520
- I just did my job. - Then...

42
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,720
why do you look so upset?

43
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
Like you said, you just did your job.

44
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
What... What's wrong with him?

45
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,080
I told you. We didn't run any tests.

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,400
Someone took her and said it was for some tests.

47
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,120
The man. The man who took her...

48
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,680
had dark skin and blond hair.

49
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,960
Blond hair?

50
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,120
We don't have such person among our staff.

51
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
- What? - There isn't someone like that.

52
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,240
That means...

53
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,240
he's the one who switched Ms. Kim and Steven.

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,760
There has been a commotion about Woo Byung Sik.

55
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
As his picture turned out to be genuine,

56
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,280
the authorities decided that he is still alive.

57
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,880
They put him on the wanted list and asked...

58
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,480
for Interpol's cooperation.

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,520
They're directing all their strength to arrest Woo Byung Sik.

60
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
Woo Byung Sik did all this.

61
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,840
He killed Ms. Kim on purpose.

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,240
- Where is 416? - He left by himself to watch TV.

63
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,640
That mean brat who doesn't have any sense of loyalty.

64
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,240
By the way, you really look upset today.

65
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
What's wrong?

66
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,240
The man who died today.

67
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,840
When he got shot, I shouted "No" without realizing.

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,560
"No"?

69
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,880
Did you really do that?

70
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,120
Yes.

71
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,120
I don't know. I don't understand why I did it either.

72
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,360
But at that moment, I didn't want him to die.

73
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,200
No. I didn't want him to die in vain so unfairly like that.

74
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,640
I think I thought like that at that moment.

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,280
Humans sometimes say they feel lousy.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,280
I guess this is how that feels.

77
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,159
I feel so lousy.

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,200
It feels so heavy inside that it's driving me crazy.

79
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,480
Why did I think like that at that moment?

80
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,040
It's not anyone else but you.

81
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,600
The coldblooded and heartless grim reaper, 444.

82
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,840
You had such thoughts.

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,600
I can't believe it myself.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,240
I'm dumbfounded.

85
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't believe it either.

86
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm having petty feelings that only those who used to be humans feel.

87
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,120
Why should I care if a human...

88
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,880
catches someone who killed his son?

89
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,480
- Hi. - You saw the news, right?

90
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
Woo Byung Sik is alive.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,120
That man isn't the one who killed Seung Chul's mom.

92
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,440
Woo Byung Sik killed her.

93
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,040
It's true. A man disguised himself as an orderly and took Ms. Kim.

94
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
We have to catch that jerk now. If we do,

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,960
we'll be able to find Woo Byung Sik.

96
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,159
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

97
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,440
I've never seen such a bothersome human like her.

98
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,640
Does she think I'm here to satisfy people's grudges?

99
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,920
- Where are you going? - To catch Woo Byung Sik.

100
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
What?

101
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,880
I can't get him out of my head.

102
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,280
It's too unfair for that couple who died.

103
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm not saving someone's life, so it's okay, right?

104
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Right.

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,200
It's not against the rules.

106
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,560
Did you find out why I can't get out of this body?

107
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm looking into it, but I haven't found out the reason.

108
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Find it out quickly.

109
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,480
(Seoun Police Station)

110
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,120
- Woo Byung Sik's picture... - Captain Bong.

111
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
- Captain Bong! - We're back.

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
I know that Woo Byung Sik is alive. It's on the news.

113
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,640
More importantly, look at this. This watch.

114
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Here.

115
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,640
Take a look. It's the same watch this man is wearing here, right?

116
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,520
People are expecting that this will reveal the truth...

117
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,440
about the Moojin Time Mart collapse after 20 years.

118
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,880
- You're right. - Right?

119
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,960
Gui Nam. Go ask them to verify if they're the same watches.

120
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,200
- Keep it confidential, okay? - Yes, sir.

121
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,560
- Hurry up, you brat. - See you.

122
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,120
It's on the news.

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Him. He's the one.

124
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,800
- Yes! - I got lucky.

125
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
All right.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,040
You.

127
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,840
Come here.

128
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,440
Who is that punk?

129
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Hey.

130
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,840
Where is Woo Byung Sik?

131
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,480
Let go. Let go of me. Who are you?

132
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,600
What are you doing? Kill him.

133
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
(Don't litter in the toilet!)

134
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,040
Gosh, that jerk.

135
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,240
Hey. What are you doing over there?

136
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,200
What? Jump over here.

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,960
Come on, jump over. It's easy, isn't it?

138
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
I told you to jump over.

139
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,240
You can't, right? Okay then.

140
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,600
You worked hard today. I'll be going now. See you.

141
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Gosh, what's going on? You said nobody would know.

142
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,560
A police officer dropped in on me.

143
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
- A police officer? Who? - I don't know.

144
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,600
I had to run, so I couldn't check. I somehow managed to ditch him.

145
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,640
This complicates things. Even if you get caught,

146
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,680
just tell them the story we came up with, okay?

147
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,360
You'd better do as I say if you wish to live.

148
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,480
You punk. Okay, come here. Come here.

149
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,600
Please... Please don't kill me.

150
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,960
- Where is Woo Byung Sik? - Please don't kill me.

151
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,440
Where is Woo Byung Sik?

152
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
I don't know...

153
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,040
Geocheon... Geocheon Port.

154
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,080
Geocheon Port?

155
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,280
I overheard him talking on the phone when I was moving that woman.

156
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,080
He told his wife to bring their kid to Geocheon Port.

157
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,240
Why?

158
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,600
They can stow away there. The police don't know about it yet.

159
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Stow away?

160
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,720
I was going to let you eat your fill today.

161
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,200
Don't be so disappointed.

162
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,280
If she doesn't tell me where the tape is soon,

163
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,080
I will chop her body into pieces and let you eat it.

164
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
Where is this rat hiding?

165
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,560
I can't believe this.

166
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,760
- Oh, goodness. - Who would do this?

167
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,880
Oh, dear.

168
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,720
- Gosh. - Who did this?

169
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,240
- What happened to him? - Goodness.

170
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
Who is it?

171
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,600
This is outrageous.

172
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,440
What on earth happened to him?

173
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,600
- My goodness. - How did this happen?

174
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,880
Woo Byung Sik?

175
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Yes.

176
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,520
People found it as planned.

177
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Okay.

178
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,200
(Last Will, Woo Byung Sik)

179
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
Why do I keep making mistakes about the moment of their deaths?

180
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,720
I clearly saw Mr. Park...

181
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,720
being stabbed to death by a man...

182
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,680
wearing a watch with a butterfly design.

183
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Why?

184
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,480
From what I saw, Steven died from the explosion, not Mr. Park's wife.

185
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,840
Why did everything change?

186
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,320
Mr. Park and Ms. Kim.

187
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,280
Joon...

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
will surely catch that jerk, Woo Byung Sik.

189
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,840
(Loser)

190
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Hello?

191
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,160
What happened? Did you catch him?

192
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
What?

193
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,360
He... He's dead?

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,680
You... You mean Woo Byung Sik?

195
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,800
Can somebody call the police?

196
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,840
Do you know what I went through...

197
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,080
because your daughter reported me to the police?

198
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,320
- Dad, stop! - Let go!

199
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Gosh, Hoon Seok.

200
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,640
You and your daughter are two peas in a pod.

201
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,840
How can she report me to the police?

202
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,280
- Gosh. - Answer me.

203
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,720
You should die for everyone's sake!

204
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,560
Speak of the devil.

205
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,200
How dare you...

206
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,840
report me to the police for domestic violence?

207
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,320
You should thank me for raising you.

208
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,360
You're such an ingrate.

209
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,000
- You little... - Stop right there!

210
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
Please stop!

211
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,840
How did you get out?

212
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,200
Your mom told them...

213
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,760
that she doesn't want me punished, so they let me go.

214
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
What are you going to do now?

215
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,040
Some parents put their lives on the line to avenge their child's death.

216
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Soon,

217
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,840
you'll receive the punishment you deserve.

218
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,440
Stop putting on a show, you crazy wench.

219
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,080
Fine!

220
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,360
Bring it on again and make me go all crazy!

221
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,200
- Bring it on! - Honey, stop!

222
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,360
Do whatever you want.

223
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,040
I don't care whether you die or not.

224
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,760
Gosh, that rude brat.

225
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,360
- Gosh! What's wrong with him? - Oh, no.

226
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,960
Hey, kid. Wake up.

227
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,880
Hoon Seok! Hoon Seok!

228
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
No!

229
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,079
Help!

230
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,680
Hey, Ms. Fortune-teller.

231
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,760
Is... Is the injury serious?

232
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,720
No, I just got a few mild scrapes,

233
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,920
but I asked the doctor to bandage me up like this.

234
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Even bandages are a fashion to me, you know.

235
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,359
I'm sorry. You got injured because of me.

236
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,280
Why are you sorry?

237
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,800
I'm saying this just in case you got the wrong idea.

238
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,720
I hope you're not thinking...

239
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,800
that I got injured while trying to save your life.

240
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,440
There was a jagged stone, so I happened to...

241
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,520
trip and fall right at that moment.

242
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,880
That's why I fell on you.

243
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,760
I wasn't trying to protect you or anything like that.

244
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,800
Don't think that it was like those scenes you see in movies. Gosh.

245
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
My gosh.

246
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,720
Your hand got all scraped too.

247
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,360
Let's get you treated first.

248
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,280
Well, and...

249
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,640
Woo Byung Sik died.

250
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,760
- What? - I think he committed suicide.

251
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Really?

252
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,960
If he's dead, doesn't that mean my dad is safe now?

253
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Right. That is true,

254
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,160
but I think I need to check again.

255
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,200
Even Seung Chul's mom and dad...

256
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,920
died differently from what I saw.

257
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,000
- I'll see you later. - Wait, you must get treated first.

258
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,560
I'll get treated when I get back.

259
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
All right.

260
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,680
If what she said is true,

261
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,840
that means Woo Byung Sik was the one who was trying to kill my dad.

262
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
That's strange.

263
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,520
The two of them have nothing to do with each other.

264
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Who are you?

265
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,560
Please let me in for a second.

266
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
No, we can't.

267

268
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,520
- Please. I just need a second. - Stop!

269
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,800
Just a second, please.

270
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
It's gone.

271
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,920
Your father won't die now.

272
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,440
Really? Is the shadow really gone?

273
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,120
Gosh, thank you so much, Ms. Fortune-teller. Thanks a lot.

274
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,520
- My gosh. - Well, could you...

275
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Well...

276
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Go get your hand treated now.

277
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,280
I'll get it treated before I leave.

278
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,480
Get some rest now. You must recover soon.

279
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,640
Sip Gyeon is waiting for you at home alone.

280
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,800
All right.

281
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
- Get some rest. - Okay, thanks.

Woo Byung Sik's body was found at Geocheon Port.

284

His body was found between anchored boats at the port.

It was discovered by fishermen who were getting ready for work,

and it's said that he was found with a deep wound on his neck...

inflicted by a sharp weapon.

carried out to determine the cause of death.

of the seven-story shopping mall, Moojin Time Mart.

297

Almost 300 people have been found dead.

298
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,080
The rescue authorities speculate that at least dozens of bodies...

299
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,280
are still buried underneath the remains of the building.

Everyone on the board including me was so against it,

303

but you conspired with Woo Byung Sik...

304
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,960

and Woo Byung Sik's whereabouts have remained unknown.

However, he was just found in a burnt-out car.

317
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,560
Woo Byung Sik was held accountable for the collapse...

318
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,520
because he's the owner of Moojin Time Mart...

319
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,880
and the CEO of the construction company.

320

were found burnt in the fire as well.

It seems that it'll be difficult to determine the cause of the accident,

00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,840
isn't dead, right?

330
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,120
I told you not to worry, didn't I?

331
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,720
Their contract has been burnt to ashes.

332
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,760
Our contract...

333
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,760
is burnt like this too.

334
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Chunsu Insurance and Moojin Time Mart...

335
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
never had a contract.

336
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,280
Time Mart...

337
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,240
is an uninsured building now.

338
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,480
Is what's written there true?

339
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm asking if Clara's claims are really true.

340
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,680
She's insisting that you received sexual favors. Is that true?

341
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,680
Why on earth did you do that? Have you lost your mind?

342
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,920
If they investigate this... Gosh.

343
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,080
Goodness, calm down.

344
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,040
I must've lost my mind momentarily.

345
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,800
Well, just call me crazy.

346
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,560
If people find out about this, it'll ruin my company and my family.

347
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,960
It will destroy everything I've built.

348
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,720
Look, Jae Geun. Please let this slide just once.

349
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,720
That hostess of the bar. Please silence her, would you?

350
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,520
Even if I do,

351
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,120
if that teenage girl tells the truth, it will end me too.

352
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,840
I heard she ran away. She will never show up again.

353
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,160
So please help me.

354
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,280
Man... Man Ho.

355
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
Hey, pretend that it was nothing.

356
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,720
Was this it?

357
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,800
Did you sign that ridiculous 30 million-dollar contract...

358
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,320
in return for the sexual favors Woo Byung Sik arranged for you?

359
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,280
An apology won't cut it.

361
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,800
Your filthy act almost ruined our company!

362
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,680
Do you think an apology is enough for that?

363
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,440
Man Ho. Please... Please stop, okay?

364
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,400
Calm down, Man Ho.

365
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,840
What are you going to do?

366
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,440
You came to my dad without reporting it.

367
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
That means you want something.

368
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,120
What are you...

369
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
You know what?

370
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,680
I will grease your superiors' palms.

371
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,280
- What? - Money can buy you anything, right?

372
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,680
I can promise you the post of a commissioner general.

373
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
You little...

374
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Okay then.

375
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,960
It is a bit disappointing though.

376
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,360
If Woo Byung Sik had been captured alive and told the truth,

377
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,000
how would Man Soo, your biggest admirer, look at you?

378
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
I wanted to see that.

379
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,960
As Mr. Jung, who moved Mr. Park Nam Soon's wife to the building...

380
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,840
with a bomb at the instigation of Woo Byung Sik, was arrested,

381
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,640
Mr. Park Soon Nam was cleared from the murder of his wife.

382
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,840
His wife, Ms. Kim Soon Hee,

383
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,400
lost her son, Mr. Park Seung Chul, 20 years ago...

384
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,880
when he was in middle school at the Moojin Time Mart disaster.

385
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,360
It's been revealed that she has been tracing...

386
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,760
Woo Byung Sik for 20 years to find the truth.

387
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,640
Meanwhile, Mr. Park Seung Chul...

388
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,760
is still classified as a missing person...

389
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,920
since only a part of his body was found at the scene.

390
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,520
(Moojin Hospital Emergency Room, 20 years ago)

391
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,120
Doctor, take a look at this patient.

392
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Where is his hand? Did you bring it?

393
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,440
- We should hurry and attach it... - He's dead.

394
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
(Park Seung Chul)

395
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
You were in a surgery all night. Aren't you going to go home?

396
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
What are you so immersed in again?

397
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Do you know him?

398
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
It's...

399
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,360
that boy.

400
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,640
What do you mean, "That boy"?

401
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,480
(Woo Byung Sik instigated the bombing)

402
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,360
(Son)

403
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Joon.

404
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,680
It's certain this time, right?

405
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,560
He didn't...

406
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,720
disguise his own death again, right?

407
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,760
Don't worry. I confirmed it myself.

408
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,400
That's a relief.

409
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
But when Ms. Kim was lying on the bed,

410
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,280
if I had taken a careful look at the shadow again,

411
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,600
she wouldn't have died such a horrible death.

412
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,360
I was a fool.

413
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,440
I should've realized sooner that the nurse was a fake.

414
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,720
"Die hard, never die".

415
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,560
Dying is hard?

416
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
She will never die?

417
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,960
I don't get what it means.

418
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,720
Anyhow, I guess she has a very strong will to live.

419
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,880
I can't understand women.

420
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Why would they like a guy with a weasel-face like this?

421
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,080
We would never choose to have this kind of face.

422
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,800
I don't like him.

423
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
Joon.

424
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,000
What are you doing over there?

425
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Nothing.

426
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,360
- Let's sit down. - Move. Move.

427
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,640
Oh, my gosh. Leo!

428
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,440
Leo! This is a limited edition.

429
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600
Have you lost your mind?

430
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
My goodness.

431
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,000
It was so hard to get this limited-edition poster.

432
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
- What have you done? - Come here.

433
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,600
What is that? Why did you draw on his face? That's childish.

434
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Sit.

435
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
Stop looking at it.

436
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,320
Now, give me your hand.

437
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Your hand.

438
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Now.

439
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Let's see.

440
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,040
Gosh, be gentle. Be gentle.

441
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,720
Your hands are always a mess.

442
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,480
Why do you always get hurt when you wish to live long?

443
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,520
You even taped that note on the fridge. You should be more careful.

444
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,960
Also, you must know when you'll die since you can see those shadows.

445
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,280
So why did you bother to tape that?

446
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,600
I can't see my own shadow of death.

447
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,440
I almost got killed when I was little.

448
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,520
- What? - And that was by my own mom.

449
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,200
Ha Ram. Let's take this one pill, okay?

450
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,240
- Mom. - Just one.

451
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,040
- No. - Ha Ram, you're a good girl.

452
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,120
- Listen to mommy. - No!

453
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,480
- You should listen to mommy. - No!

454
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Take it! Ha Ram. You're a good girl, right?

455
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,200
Take it. Take it!

456
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,560
- Take it, and die! Take it! - Dad!

457
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,720
Take it!

458
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,000
Dad!

459
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,440
You don't know...

460
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,360
how terrible it is to see your own death, right?

461
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,120
(Die hard! Never die!)

462
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Since that day, I have decided to never die.

463
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,000
I decided to survive...

464
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,960
no matter what happens.

465
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,960
I will...

466
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
live a long, quiet life.

467
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,640
I will live until I become an old lady.

468
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,760
It hurts.

469
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,960
Don't be such a crybaby.

470
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm going now.

471
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,480
Wait, Joon. Wait just for a second.

472
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Here.

473
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,520
It's your bracelet.

474
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,440
I stayed up all night to make it when you moved to Seoul.

475
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,720
You may not remember, but you always wore it.

476
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Here.

477
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
It doesn't look so good.

478
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
It doesn't look good?

479
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
Get... Get home safely.

480
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,640
Get home safely.

481
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,160
He's a detective. Didn't he learn how to wrap bandages?

482
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,160
It looks so tacky.

483
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,640
I'm going to live a long life.

484
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm going to live until I become an old lady.

485
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,320
Why do I keep caring about whether some petty human lives or dies?

486
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,080
She's such an annoying person.

487
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,040
Just wait for your turn.

488
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,520
I'll take you with me as soon as I catch that loser.

489
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
You.

490
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,720
Why didn't you answer your phone the entire day?

491
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,720
What happened between you and Soo Wan?

492
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Did you two have a fight?

493
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,440
Why did she hand in a resignation letter, and why can't I reach her?

494
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,920
She's going to go to the US.

495
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,920
She said she's going to study.

496
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,280
The US? And you didn't stop her?

497
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,200
Did you just let her leave like that?

498
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,360
I made some beef bone soup for you.

499
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,199
So don't skip your meals.

500
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,040
I'll go now.

501
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,520
When you get your memory back,

502
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,760
you'll regret letting Soo Wan leave like that.

503
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,400
Do you know how much you loved her?

504
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,639
You're the one who kept following her around.

505
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,120
Why did that doctor just leave?

506
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,400
My heart beat so strong whenever I saw her.

507
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,160
But now, it even hurts just hearing her name.

508
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,280
I should've caught him myself.

509
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,920
My gosh, he's dead anyway.

510
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,520
Stop caring about him. It's not like you.

511
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,560
"If you do not fill your mind, it will be empty with worries."

512
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,480
It's "If you do not empty your mind, it will be filled with worries."

513
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,200
Gosh, stop talking as if you're an actor in a historical drama.

514
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,640
It's really annoying.

515
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,240
You're right. It's not like me.

516
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,600
These are side effects from staying too long in a human body.

517
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,840
I keep dreaming like a human does.

518
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,640
I can't teleport anymore.

519
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,880
On top of that, I'm starting to pity other humans.

520
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,040
This is all because of that loser.

521
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,440
That loser.

522
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,080
I'm going to kill you when I find you.

523
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,040
Hello, sir. Yes.

524
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,040
Did you see the photo I sent you?

525
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Yes.

526
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,440
Okay, just a second. The back?

527
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,200
It says "SE".

528
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,880
Really?

529
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,920
Yes, okay. I'll bring it to you right now.

530
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,920
So is Woo Byung Sik the original owner of this watch?

531
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,880
Yes. Woo Byung Sik gave this watch to his son.

532
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
Park Soon Nam kept this with him so that he could use it...

533
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,480
to lure Woo Byung Sik, and Pastor Kang stole it from him.

534
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,800
Then Moo Gang found it in Pastor Kang's house.

535
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,920
I see.

536
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,760
But now that Byung Sik's dead,

537
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,280
we can't ask him if he killed Han Jin Sook.

538
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,720
Well, I just talked to a craftsman regarding watches.

539
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,880
- Yes. - And he said...

540
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,160
that there might not be another watch like this.

541
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,600
So I'm going to go check on that.

542
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
What?

543
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,040
So if we prove that this is the only watch with this kind of design,

544
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,080
that'll prove that Woo Byung Sik is the culprit...

545
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,040
who gave orders to kill Han Jin Sook.

546
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,520
That's right. Can I go now?

547
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,160
Yes, you can go. Bye.

548
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Bye.

549
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,200
Mr. Oh got hurt because of me.

550
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,560
I should work hard starting today.

551
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,200
Then I'll be able to get my dad's files sooner.

552
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,760
And Mr. Oh will be able to become a proper CEO.

553
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Hello?

554
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,200
Yes, I'm Kang Ha Ram.

Joon.

557
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
What? I didn't trip.

558
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
The rock...

559
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,520
Where did that rock go?

560
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,200
Get in the car quickly. We need to go somewhere.

561
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,440
Where did the rock go?

562
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,200
You didn't have to pick me up. I could've gone on my own.

563
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,200
But what should I say when I get investigated as a witness?

564
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,960
It's not like I can tell them the truth.

565
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,640
What? A witness investigation?

566
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
(Certified Brand Watches)

567
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
It's just as I thought.

568
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,840
This watch was made by Henry Schneider.

569
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,200
Can you see his initials right here?

570
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,680
I've become far sighted with age.

571
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
What did you say his name was again?

572
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,640
He's the best craftsman of watches in Switzerland.

573
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,160
This is probably worth more than 300,000 dollars.

574
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,360
Plus, he died last year because of cancer.

575
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,040
So I'm sure it'll cost a lot more now.

576
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,400
A single watch can cost 300,000 dollars?

577
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,200
Yes. You should think of it as a piece of art instead.

578
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,200
Henry Schneider designs and makes...

579
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,240
every single component for his watch.

580
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Even the components?

581
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,160
Yes. That's why I called it a piece of art.

582
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,840
This guy never makes the same watch twice.

583
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,440
So I'm pretty sure this is the only watch there is in this design.

584
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,440
On top of that, this butterfly is a part of his Chaos series.

585
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,880
So there can only be one.

586
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,040
My gosh, I can't believe I'm actually seeing one of his works.

587
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,040
Sir, are you sure that this was made by a master craftsman?

588
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,720
Gosh, of course.

589
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,840
But I guess I should check to be sure, so I'll call you...

590
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,160
after I take a closer look.

591
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,840
Sometimes, the components turn out to be fake.

592
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,440
Okay. Please do me a favor.

593
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,880
Moo Gang, long time no see.

594
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,840
I heard you found Woo Byung Sik's watch.

595
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,160
This might lead to a major breakthrough.

596
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,960
But if someone finds out that you broke into his house...

597
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,680
and took that watch, it'll all end up going to waste.

598
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,200
You shouldn't do that next time.

599
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,360
You should be grateful that Pastor Kang didn't babble about you.

600
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,560
Hey, Crazy Dog. Yes?

601
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,760
- Captain Bong. - Yes?

602
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,240
- The chief is looking for you. - Yes.

603
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,360
- Hurry. - Okay.

604
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,640
Yes, okay. Let's talk at the office.

605
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,720
I knew you'd be different since you studied in the States.

606
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,720
You punk.

607
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,720
What was that?

608
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
So are you saying...

609
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,280
you were there for your own business and just happened to come across...

610
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,320
the crime site without knowing that the bomb was going to go off?

611
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,400
And you're also saying that you saw a fake nurse,

612
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,160
bribed by Woo Byung Sik,

613
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,440
switching Mr. Park's wife when you were at the hospice ward...

614
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,880
just by coincidence, right?

615
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,760
Yes, that's right.

616
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,360
My mom works in that hospital.

617
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,080
Well, it happened when I was there to see my mom.

618
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,240
All these coincidences do not seem coincidental at all.

619
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,440
That's enough.

620
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,520
We'll call you if there's anything more we'd like to ask.

621
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,280
- Okay. - Let's go.

622
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,480
Go home safely, and call me when you find out about anything.

623
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,800
Bye.

624
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,640
Does that mean Park Soon Nam was able to prove his innocence?

625
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,920
I guess so.

626
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,000
Joon, are Seung Chul's parents no longer being doubted...

627
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,080
for something they didn't do?

628
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,960
Yes. Follow me.

629
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,200
I don't know who threw all those photos of Woo Byung Sik,

630
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,800
but I thank him so much.

631
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Right.

632
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,160
Now, let's go back to focusing on finding...

633
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,240
that mean jerk who's trying to harm Leo, shall we?

634
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,240
Just a moment.

635
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,640
Yes, Mr. Oh.

636
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,400
How do you feel?

637
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,120
I'm a lot better. I even got rid of my cast.

638
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,760
Where are you?

639
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,520
What? You're at the police station?

640
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,680
Oh, I see.

641
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,200
I also got a call saying that I needed to get investigated.

642
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,320
I'm going to go after work.

643
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,080
Don't worry. I'll just make something up.

644
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,480
Okay, I'll go to your office...

645
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,960
and give you a business report.

646
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,440
Okay. Bye.

647
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,440
Where's Sang Min? I haven't seen him around lately.

648
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,720
He went to the States to meet his mother.

649
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,560
He must've gone to go shopping with his mother.

650
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,600
My goodness. Sip Gyeon, chew well.

651
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,280
I'll go now, Joon.

652
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,920
Thank you for picking me up.

653
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,960
Did you forget? Leo's in danger right now.

654
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,880
That's true.

655
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,240
But you'll need to go alone today.

656
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,320
I really need to work starting from today.

657
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,640
Mr. Oh got hurt instead of me.

658
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,280
Let's go see him tomorrow.

659
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,160
No, no. I'm the one in a hurry. I have no time.

660
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,320
I don't have time either. I need to get those documents...

661
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,280
in order to catch my dad's murderer.

662
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,200
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

663
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,400
Joon.

664
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,720
She'll try to save that woman's life if she sees her.

665
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,120
Why... Why are you suddenly doing this?

666
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,800
I can't just let you leave like this.

667
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,160
I should've been more considerate. I'm sorry.

668
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,760
I was too selfish. I'm sorry. So please don't be angry, okay?

669
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,280
It's okay, Joon.

670
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,320
I'm the one who's sorry.

671
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,600
A shadow...

672
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,200
What are you doing here?

673
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,000
Where's your mom? Where is she?

674
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,040
Where's your mom? Why are you here all by yourself?

675
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,040
Hyo Jin.

676
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,880
Mom.

677
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,840
Where were you? I've been looking for you for ages.

678
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,760
I needed to go to the bathroom.

679
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,320
What's your problem?

680
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,120
Hey, Ms. Fortune-teller.

681
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,560
You jerk.

682
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,280
You piece of trash.

683
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,880
You were at the Halloween party, weren't you?

684
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,440
What?

685
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,880
Yes, I was. But who...

686
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,840
You better be careful of Oh Man Soo.

687
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,200
Don't ever trust him.

688
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,600
What do you mean?

689
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,320
He's the one who made me look like this.

690
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,200
(Exclusive! Royeol Group's youngest son, Oh Man Soo, faces a lawsuit.)

691
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,720
What?

692
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,680
Let's go. You should go and tell her that you're sorry.

693
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,520
You should beg her for forgiveness.

694
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,440
No, let me go. I didn't do it.

695
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,720
What are you talking about?

696
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,240
She's going to kill herself and her daughter...

697
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,840
after being falsely accused as a con artist.

698
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,640
Ask her for forgiveness, and just turn yourself in.

699
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,760
Hurry up.

700
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,840
Let me go.

701
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,000
Let me go now.

702
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,320
Go see her right now.

703
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,920
I said, let me go!

704
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,680
Can't you trust me either?

705
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,760
She's going to try to save the mother and daughter this time.

706
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,560
When will I be able to catch that loser?

707
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,960
Oh Man Soo is the youngest son of Royeol Group's Oh Chun Soo.

708
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,600
And he's also the CEO of Royeol Insurance.

709
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,400
He's facing charges for having attempted to rape a woman...

710
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,640
and for inflicting injuries on her that will take...

711
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,560
seven weeks to fully recover.

712
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,240
The police have started investigating the case.

713
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,520
- The receiver's phone is off. - And according to the victim,

714
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,960
- Please leave a message after... - she wishes Mr. Oh to...

715
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,200
My gosh!

716
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,040
Royeol Insurance's CEO, Mr. Oh Man Soo, is facing charges...

717
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,920
for attempted rape and assault.

718
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,320
It also turns out that he has a criminal record.

719
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,160
We don't know what that criminal record is yet.

720
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,360
And we can't be sure if he really tried to rape the victim or not.

721
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,400
- However... - How irresponsible can you get?

722
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,800
We've confirmed that he was once taken to...

723
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,800
the police station for having gotten in a fight with a bartender.

724
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,200
I didn't do it.

725
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,120
Then why did she sue you?

726
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,200
Hey.

727
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,680
Look at this.

728
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,280
Even your friend's a witness. Don't try to lie to me.

729
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,760
(Written Statement, Name: Lee Young Hee)

730
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,400
Look into her background, and release it to the press.

731
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,000
Find anything that could become a weakness.

732
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,240
Who's that?

733
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,360
- It's you. - Really?

734
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,720
Hyo Jin, you should wash up and sleep now.

735
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,280
Wash up, okay?

736
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,200
- Who are you? - My gosh.

737
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,160
(Sip Gyeon)

738
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,320
I said, let me go!

739
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,240
Can't you trust me either?

740
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,880
Mr. Oh really is not the type to do such a thing.

741
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,200
But the will...

742
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,480
Why did you come here?

743
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,120
I just wanted to see if you were doing okay.

744
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,120
By the way,

745
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,560
are you sure it was...

746
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,840
Mr. Oh?

747
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,120
Did Man Soo send you?

748
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,200
Does he want me to settle?

749
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,600
No. That's not why I'm here.

750
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,760
I want you to tell him that...

751
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,360
I'm not going to settle for even a trillion dollars.

752
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,200
I'm going to make him pay for doing this to me.

753
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,200
No, that's not why I'm here. I...

754
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,280
Get out! Get out of here!

755
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,160
- Go away! - I... I'm sorry.

756
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,280
- My gosh. - Get out of here!

757
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,000
You're mistaken!

758
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,280
Excuse me.

759
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,280
You're so easy to predict.

760
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,880
What are you doing here, Joon?

761
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,160
I followed you here because I thought you'd get yourself...

762
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,320
in trouble again after seeing a shadow in that little girl's body.

763
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,280
Her mom...

764
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,920
is going to carry her to a really high building and jump from there.

765
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,040
She commits suicide after she writes a will...

766
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,560
because she gets upset for people mistaking her as a con artist.

767
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,360
Then that puppet CEO really must've done that to her.

768
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,240
Then she won't have to die because he is guilty.

769
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,480
I guess so.

770
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,400
But Mr. Oh...

771
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,680
isn't the type to do such a thing.

772
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,840
How can you be so sure of that?

773
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,880
Exactly.

774
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,720
She ends up putting...

775
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,160
her life and her daughter's life on the line because of him.

776
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,160
And that makes me wonder if Mr. Oh really is guilty.

777
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,280
I never trust any human being.

778
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,960
I don't want you trusting anyone either.

779
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,360
Let's go now.

780
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,960
Why is she so down?

781
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,600
It's bothering me.

782
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,160
- He's coming. - His car's coming.

783
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,400
- There he is. - He's coming.

784
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,040
He's here.

785
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,000
Did you see her face and body condition?

786
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,120
Why did you invite a woman who works at a bar to your party?

787
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,760
Did you have ulterior motives when you invited her?

788
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,040
She must think of calumny very lightly...

789
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,160
just because I'm a son of a conglomerate.

790
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,040
Falsely accusing someone is a serious crime.

791
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,560
I'll surely make her pay for what she did.

792
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,960
- Please tell us more! - Give us more details!

793
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,520
- Please say a few more words! - Please tell us more!

794
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,560
We think that she's a typical gold digger who blackmails men.

795
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,160
We believe that what she's doing is completely illegal...

796
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,480
and will take strong legal actions against her.

797
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,240
The accuser who's pressing charges against Royeol Insurance's Mr. Oh...

798
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,400
does work at an adult entertainment establishment,

799
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,240
and she was even arrested for taking Ecstasy 10 years ago.

800
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,400
She also has a daughter who was born out of wedlock.

801
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,720
So she has a criminal record.

802
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,160
A barmaid is insisting that she almost got raped...

803
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,400
and that she got seriously assaulted because she refused.

804
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,160
Well... I guess it's possible, but it's a little...

805
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,760
Gosh, this is crazy. Those shameless reporters...

806
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,200
Is that considered sexual assault?

807
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,600
Where's the evidence?

808
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,320
It's not like Mr. Oh Man Soo's DNA was found inside her body.

809
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,040
But she needs to be hospitalized for six weeks...

810
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,080
It's possible that she tried to hurt herself.

811
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,280
If she says that she got assaulted and settles with the accused,

812
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,240
- it'll greatly affect Royeol Group. - Mom, what's a gold digger?

813
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,960
- What? - It's obvious...

- Go. You'll be late for school. - Okay.

816
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,240
She's clearly trying to extract money from the corporate heir.

817
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,240
You said she even has a daughter.

818
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,640
That girl should be calling me any minute now.

819
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,800
But you won't have it your way this time.

820
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,800
I won't let that happen.

825
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,760
in the CCTV footage...

826
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,320
is the same one as Woo Byung Sik's watch,

827
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,200
but the craftsman never makes more than one of the same design.

828
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,960
Then it must've been Woo Byung Sik's doing.

Right, but we don't have enough evidence.

830

so we're utilizing our informants at the moment...

831

to find the guy who has a missing finger...

832
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,440
and received the killing orders.

833
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,640
If we can get him to admit...

834
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,800
that Woo Byung Sik instigated to commit the murder...

Well, Woo Byung Sik is dead now anyway.

to be Oh Man Soo's best friend, and the professional baseball player,

848

Hey, look. You need to watch that.

That's the reality of this country.

853
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,720
Just to bury the Woo Byung Sik case,

854
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,800
they intentionally made that scandal break out.

855
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,560
This is a conspiracy.

Why should we connect the two cases together and wrap them up?

868
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,560
Gosh, we don't have enough evidence yet.

We haven't checked the parts in it yet.

All right, fine. Let's say that it is one of a kind.

873

But what if Woo Byung Sik lent it to the person who killed Han Jin Sook?

874
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,080
And how would Han Jin Sook have known about him being alive?

875

Even if she had known about it, why would that jerk, who ran away...

Is there evidence to prove that Han Jin Sook didn't kill Woo Byung Sik?

Is there? Answer me.

01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,320
but the price has hit the bottom because of what you did.

974
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,200
What will you do about it? How will you fix it?

975
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,680
Let's go and eat something, Yoon Seok.

976
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,120
You're a barmaid with a child. You almost got raped?

977
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,320
Even a dog would sneer at you.

978
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,920
What did you just say? You little...

979
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,040
- How rude. - What are you doing now?

980
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,640
- Let go of her! - I said, let go!

981
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,720
What? Why you...

982
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,800
- You started it! - Enough. Break it up!

983
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,920
Mister, please help my mom.

984
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,360
Go away.

985
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,440
- Just go. - Mister, please help my mom.

986
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,920
Go away.

987
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,120
And don't call me mister, okay?

988
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,600
Mister, please.

989
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,880
I'll give you something delicious.

990
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,000
- Mister, please. - What?

991
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,120
What's this?

992
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,720
Leave me alone. Go away!

993
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,600
Mister.

994
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,560
Here. Try to hit right here.

995
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
It doesn't hurt at all.

996
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,360
Hyo Jin.

997
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,600
That little rascal.

998
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,000
We could eat together.

999
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,360
Why are you crying? What's wrong?

1000
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,240
Are you feeling better now?

1001
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,960
Oh, would you like some food?

1002
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,520
Now, the next one.

1003
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,880
You're so good at this.

1004
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,280
Young Hee.

1005
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,880
It's me, Madam Hwang.

1006
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,600
You look terrible. Have you eaten yet?

1007
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,400
What brings you here?

1008
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,560
(Agreement)

1009
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,360
If you sign it, we'll send you a million dollars right away.

1010
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,560
A million dollars?

1011
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,360
(Accuser Lee Young Hee)

1012
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,520
(Accused Oh Man Soo)

1013
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,640
(Mr. Oh never assaulted me on October 30, 2017.)

1014
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,760
What is this?

1015
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,720
I hurt myself...

1016
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,960
and blackmailed him?

1017
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,520
You're basically saying that I should admit being a gold digger.

1018
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,080
You jerks.

1019
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,200
Gosh, what are you doing now?

1020
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,960
Do you know how hard it is to earn a million dollars?

1021
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,120
Madam Hwang!

1022
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,720
Women like us...

1023
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,480
will never even get to see a million dollars in our lifetime.

1024
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,960
Then what about my sufferings? What about the unfairness?

1025
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,600
Everyone in the country thinks that I'm a gold digger now!

1026
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,640
Do you think that people will stop thinking of you that way...

1027
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,760
if you don't sign this agreement?

1028
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,520
Do you actually think that people will believe women like us?

1029
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,520
And until when will you work as a bar girl...

1030
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,040
to raise Hyo Jin?

1031
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,120
Do you only care about how you feel? You don't think about Hyo Jin?

1032
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,439
If you don't sign the agreement,

1033
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,359
you'll get arrested for making false accusations,

1034
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,000
blackmailing, defamation, and so on.

1035
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:45,439
Then...

1036
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,040
what do you think will happen to your daughter...

1037
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,640
who will be left alone?

1038
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,439
It really isn't a difficult decision.

1039
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,720
Will you sign it and keep your lips sealed,

1040
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,279
or will you go to jail?

1041
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:04,040
Please think about it. Call me when you make up your mind.

1042
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:10,319
Hey.

1043
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,040
Just think about Hyo Jin.

1044
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:15,520
Only Hyo Jin, okay?

1045
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,120
You poor thing.

1046
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,160
What was that just now?

1047
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,040
Ha Ram said that two people will die together.

1048
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,280
Well, sir.

1049
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,680
I told you not to interrupt.

1050
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,720
Hyo Jin.

1051
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,320
Gosh, this kid was being so stubborn.

1052
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,560
Mister, please don't send my mom to jail.

1053
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,720
What?

1054
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,760
I brought this. So please...

1055
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,880
don't put my mom behind bars, okay?

1056
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,600
Mister!

1057
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,560
Mister, please.

1058
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,800
Why are you being like this?

1059
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,480
- Come on. - Please...

1060
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,880
- Mister! - Let's go.

1061
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,480
Help my mom.

1062
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,240
Mister, please help my mom.

1063
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,640
Please!

1064
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,920
Mister, please help her.

1065
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,640
(Agreement)

1066
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,520
(Accuser Lee Young Hee: My mom)

1067
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,880
Yes, Lawyer Park.

1068
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,440
What is this agreement?

1069
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,480
Did you threaten Tiffany with this?

1070
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,600
You could've just gone to court. Why did you have to do this?

1071
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,120
She'll be charged as a gold digger and commit suicide with her kid.

1072
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,360
Come with me.

1073
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,640
Where's your mom?

1074
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,320
You know your mom's phone number, right?

1075
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,600
Tell me!

1076
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,960
I'm taking you to the police!

1077
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,040
You'll be in big trouble!

1078
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,280
- Got it? - No. Let me go!

1079
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,240
Follow me!

1080
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,000
Stop it.

1081
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,520
Go back to work.

1082
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,160
Mister.

1083
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,160
Don't come close.

1084
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,560
- Don't cling on to me. - Mister.

1085
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,800
Joon.

1086
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,960
What are you doing here?

1087
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,680
Oh, you told me to keep watch.

1088
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,080
This kid was wandering by herself, so I was keeping an eye on her.

1089
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,880
Wait, what are you doing here?

1090
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,120
I came to see Mr. Oh.

1091
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,600
What?

1092
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,560
It's nothing. Let's go.

1093
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,360
Hyo Jin, let's go to your mom.

1094
01:12:58,840 --> 01:12:59,840
Hold on.

1095
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,360
Yes, Mr. Oh.

1096
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,560
Yes. I understand. Okay.

1097
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,360
Wait.

1098
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,120
Go first.

1099
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,320
I need to talk to Mr. Oh. I'll be right out.

1100
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,400
Go first.

1101
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,760
Wait.

1102
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,480
What are you doing? Get off of me.

1103
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,040
The shadow you saw in Tiffany...

1104
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,760
Tell me everything about it. Don't leave anything out.

1105
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,880
Well... The thing is...

1106
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,720
I saw...

1107
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,880
Tiffany and her daughter by chance at the police station.

1108
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,480
I saw the same video for both people.

1109
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,320
I'm not sure where it was.

1110
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,240
I saw the honeymoon car at the amusement park.

1111
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
Anyway.

1112
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,360
She took her daughter to a high place and jumped.

1113
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,720
There was a will too.

1114
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,040
A will?

1115
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,760
Okay. You can go now.

1116
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,840
Mr. Oh.

1117
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,000
I said, go.

1118
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,560
Mr. Oh!

1119
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,640
Say something.

1120
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,720
I'm confused too.

1121
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,520
If I stay still,

1122
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,240
Tiffany and her daughter will die.

1123
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,360
Mr. Oh!

1124
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,400
Mr. Oh!

1125
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,680
(Statement)

1126
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,360
(She broke the second-floor window and jumped out.)

1127
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,760
(Witness Statement)

1128
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,960
(Witness, Son Byung Ho)

1129
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,120
What are you doing?

1130
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,040
Why did you take my child without saying anything?

1131
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,680
I didn't take...

1132
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,760
Come with me.

1133
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,680
Mom, don't worry, I just...

1134
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,720
I'm upset as it is. Why are you making me feel worse?

1135
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,880
Why are you doing this? Why won't you listen?

1136
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,200
Why?

1137
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,040
I hate you, Mom!

1138
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,640
Why are you crying?

1139
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,960
Why are you crying?

1140
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,520
I begged Uncle Man Soo to forgive you.

1141
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,600
What?

1142
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,280
I got on my knees and asked Uncle Man Soo to forgive you.

1143
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,040
To forgive you just this once.

1144
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,640
I begged him like this.

1145
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,720
Why did you beg him?

1146
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,720
My daughter, why did you beg him?

1147
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,240
I'm sorry. Mommy's sorry.

1148
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,400
Why did you beg him?

1149
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,400
Punish those obsessed with money!

1150
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,400
- Punish them! - Punish them!

1151
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,120
A man isn't a women's wallet!

1152
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,600
- They're not! - They're not!

1153
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,120
Victims shouldn't be punished!

1154
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,440
- They shouldn't be punished! - They shouldn't be punished!

1155
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,480
Leo's best friend, Oh Man Soo, is innocent!

1156
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,480
- He's innocent! - He's innocent!

1157
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,280
- Die, you gold digger! - Die!

1158
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,680
What did I do wrong?

1159
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,920
Why are you doing this to me?

1160
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,520
What on earth happened?

1161
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,200
I told you to bring Tiffany to my room?

1162
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,760
You don't remember anything when you black out from drinking.

1163
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,960
I told you not to drink too much that night.

1164
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,160
You were acting up and being a jerk.

1165
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,720
I don't know what happened, but you drank until you were drunk.

1166
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,480
Then you told me to bring Tiffany to your room.

1167
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,000
I did? To my room?

1168
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,960
Yes. You were stumbling around and...

1169
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,800
Hey. Hey!

1170
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,720
Did you see Tiffany?

1171
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,480
Who? Tiffany?

1172
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
Yes.

1173
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,800
I bought a video game for her daughter, so tell her to get it.

1174
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,120
- Hurry. - What's he saying?

1175
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,080
I had a hard time writing my statement.

1176
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,760
But what can I do? I can't lie.

1177
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,680
Leo and I are in trouble because of you.

1178
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,240
Don't contact me for the time being.

1179
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'll get going now.

1180
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,880
Was it really me?

1181
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,960
No way.

1182
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,240
No. It can't be.

1183
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,400
It was you, right?

1184
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,480
Go out.

1185
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,040
What's wrong?

1186
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,680
That day, you were in my room.

1187
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,680
Gosh, why is he in my room?

1188
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,920
Leo!

1189
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,240
Wake up! Get up right now!

1190
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,680
Darn it.

1191
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,280
You were sleeping on the sofa in my room.

1192
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,000
I remember clearly, but...

1193
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,040
they're saying that Tiffany almost got raped in that room.

1194
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,520
I looked into it,

1195
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,320
and during the time Tiffany claims to have gotten raped,

1196
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,960
no one saw you at the party.

1197
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,000
You were in that room.

1198
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,880
If Tiffany had gotten raped in that room by me or someone else,

1199
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,640
there is no way you wouldn't have known.

1200
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Even if you were passed out,

1201
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,800
Tiffany got beat half to death in that room.

1202
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,280
There's no way you wouldn't know.

1203
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,080
You tried to drag her into a hotel with you in the past too.

1204
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,560
It was you, right?

1205
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,760
You jerk!

1206
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,720
Goodness.

1207
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,080
You really don't remember anything?

1208
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,640
You're right. I was in your room then.

1209
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,960
So it was you, you jerk!

1210
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,400
No.

1211
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,160
I didn't hit Tiffany.

1212
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,960
I woke up from my nap,

1213
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,760
so I went out to the back garden to sober up.

1214
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,040
It was dark, so I couldn't see his face,

1215
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,040
but the person I saw in the window...

1216
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,280
was someone with glow-in-the-dark face paint on.

1217
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,480
It was you, Oh Man Soo.

1218
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,880
Leo, it's time. Come out.

1219
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,360
What on earth did I do?

1220
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,640
What should I do?

1221
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,400
If I admit to my crime now...

1222
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,600
All right, I just need to keep my mouth shut.

1223
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,640
Leo will pretend not to know.

1224
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,680
I just need to stay quiet.

1225
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,040
Then it will pass over quietly.

1226
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,480
It will float

1227
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,080
I'm sorry,

1228
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,400
Hyo Jin.

1229
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,800
I'm sorry you had to...

1230
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,000
get on your knees and beg...

1231
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,240
because of me.

1232
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,280
All right.

1233
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,720
I'll do as you all wish...

1234
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,680
and die.

1235
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,040
Where are we going?

1236
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,480
To the amusement park.

1237
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,400
The amusement park? But it's dark.

1238
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,600
It's open at night too.

1239
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,080
(Sunglasses)

1240
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,080
Please save my mom.

1241
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,040
- Go away. - Mister, please save my mom.

1242
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:07,880
Why are you crying?

1243
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,400
All humans die.

1244
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,480
Dying isn't a big deal.

1245
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,280
I'm the Grim Reaper. I'm 444, the best there is in this business.

1246
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,280
It doesn't make sense that I'm being swayed by this.

1247
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,280
What is this?

1248
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,240
Am I really become human?

1249
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,800
Hyo Jin.

1250
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,320
You said you wanted to fly, right?

1251
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,480
Like a bird?

1252
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,520
Let's fly magnificently...

1253
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,880
here today.

1254
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,480
We're going to close our eyes tightly...

1255
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,400
and fly.

1256
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,520
Together. You and me.

1257
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,800
It's their destiny to die. It's none of my business.

1258
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,640
Those punks come and go whenever they want. Where are they today?

1259
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,320
It should be done by now, right?

1260
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,920
(Will)

1261
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,160
(911 Emergency Rescue)

1262
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,480
What are you doing here?

1263
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,520
Those two humans died because of you.

1264
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,800
Go to the police right now, and tell them everything, you punk!

1265
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,600
I need to at least free them from their injustice.

1266
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,400
Who is that human?

1267
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,160
He has a strong force.

1268
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,680
What is this?

1269
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,880
This punk dies too?

1270
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,120
(Black)

1271
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,080
Why do I keep making mistakes about the moment of their deaths?

1272
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,720
I never trust humans.

1273
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,760
Where's Woo Byung Sik?

1274
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,480
I don't know who released all those photos, but I'm very grateful.

1275
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,240
You shouldn't trust anyone either.

1276
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,400
You should be careful of Oh Man Soo.

1277
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,320
Yes. It'll be fine as long as I keep quiet.

1278
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,320
I'll die as you wish.

1279
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,920
You're going to die?

1280
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,640
You won't have it your way.
