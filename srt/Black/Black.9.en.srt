1
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,800
But the person I saw in the window...

2
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,880
(Episode 9)

3
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,640
was you, Oh Man Soo.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,880
Leo, it's time. Come out.

5
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,960
What on earth did I do?

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,720
What should I do?

7
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,039
Ms. Fortune-teller.

8
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,000
Where's Tiffany? Where is she now?

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,440
She's not home. She's not picking up her phone either.

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,600
I... I must've done it.

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,200
I don't remember anything because I was too drunk,

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,480
but it must've been me.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
- I did it. - You should find her...

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,560
and beg her for forgiveness before it's too late.

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,039
That's why I came here.

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,920
Where do you think she'd be now?

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,640
What if it's already too late?

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,000
Gosh.

19
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,600
It was...

20
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,640
somewhere you can see the entire city of Seoul.

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,800
A Ferris wheel... I remember seeing a Ferris wheel.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Where you can see the entire city of Seoul and a Ferris wheel...

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,080
I think it's Royeol World.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,039
You can see the entire city from the fortress walls behind it.

25
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,240
Get in.

26
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,120
No!

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,320
I wronged you. I'm sorry.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
I did it. It was me.

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,400
I'll turn myself in.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,040
I'll correct everything.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,720
No, it wasn't you.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,000
I wounded that jerk's neck that day,

33
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,120
but it was on the right side.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,079
I scratched his neck with the ring on my left hand,

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,400
so it must've been the right side.

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
The scar on your neck is on the left side.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
It wasn't you, Man Soo.

38
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,560
The scar on Mr. Oh's neck...

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,280
was from the debris of the building when it exploded.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,080
When you were being taken to the hospital,

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,320
I saw the scrape on the left side of your neck.

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,520
That jerk...

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,200
That jerk lied to me.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,400
What?

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Please take care of Hyo Jin and Tiffany.

46
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,600
The culprit was someone else.

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,640
Who is that jerk?

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,520
Right. Why did the youngest son of the Royeol family visit you?

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
What did he say?

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,240
I don't want you to meet a guy who's being accused of sexual assault.

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,720
What did he say? It wasn't anything serious, right?

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,200
- I'm tired. - All right.

53
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
Hey, Leo!

54
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,440
What is this?

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,640
I think Oh Man Soo came to talk to him after knowing that he did it.

56
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,080
I can't just leave this.

57
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,720
Hello, sir. It looks like Leo got himself into trouble.

58
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
(Statement)

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,440
(Witness Statement)

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,720
(Oh Man Soo went upstairs after asking me to tell Tiffany,)

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,520
(and I passed the message along to her.)

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,720
That jerk, Son Byung Ho, lied.

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,520
Detective Han.

64
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,720
Those two humans died because of you.

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,840
Go to the police right now, and tell them everything, you punk.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
I must at least free them from their injustice.

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,720
Who is that human?

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
What is this?

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,040
Will this punk die too?

70
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,200
(Seoun Police Station)

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
What happened?

72
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,640
Did you save their lives?

73
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,200
I have a favor to ask of you, Joon.

74
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
Let me out. Let me get out of here.

75
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,240
What on earth is this about?

76
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,880
You brought me here for another statement. What are you doing now?

77
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,440
I'm really sorry.

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,720
Please stay in there for just a while. It's the safest place now.

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,520
Gosh, what is this nonsense about?

80
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
What happened?

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,960
What happened to that woman?

82
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,440
We have a big problem, Joon.

83
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,120
Mr. Oh will get killed.

84
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
He'll get killed?

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hey, Son Byung Ho! I know that you're home now.

86
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,160
Come out right now. Come out!

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
You jerk, why didn't you pick up? Where are you now?

88
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
Why did you lie to me, you jerk?

89
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,560
You know who did that to Tiffany, don't you?

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,640
Who is it? Tell me who it is!

91
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,200
Well, Man Soo, please calm down first.

92
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
- Hear me out... - Calm down?

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
You want me to calm down?

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,800
Let's meet somewhere quiet. Right, I'll see you at your cottage.

95
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,800
He'll get killed?

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
But it'll be...

97
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,400
staged as suicide.

98
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,480
I think that the jerk who did that to Tiffany...

99
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
is trying to kill Mr. Oh and stage it as suicide...

100
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,159
to make him take the blame for everything.

101
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,160
But that jerk...

102
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,080
doesn't have a middle finger.

103
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
He doesn't have a middle finger?

104
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,800
At first, I thought that it was bitten off by Sip Gyeon,

105
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,480
but I remembered that there wasn't a single drop of blood.

106
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,840
It must've been a prosthetic finger.

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,560
He doesn't have a middle finger? Could he be...

108
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
the man who killed Han Jin Sook?

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,680
You're saying that you want me to stage it as suicide, right?

110
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,600
Anyway, we'll be able to save Mr. Oh's life and catch that jerk,

111
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,120
who assaulted Tiffany, if we track down the guy with a missing finger.

112
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,920
Then why is she supposed to die?

113
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,520
Why?

114
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
She'll take her own life.

115
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,880
She won't jump this time. She'll slit her wrist.

116
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
You mean she'll kill herself?

117
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,080
I don't understand what's going on.

118
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,720
You said that your boss...

119
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,320
will get framed and die, but it'll be staged as suicide.

120
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,480
Then the misunderstanding will be cleared. Why would she kill herself?

121
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,360
I think that it's strange too.

122
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,960
I can't understand it no matter how hard I think about it.

123
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
What?

124
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,760
Hey, Moo Gang. Hey.

125
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,640
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

126
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,560
Come here. Hey.

127
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,520
Why is that woman here?

128
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,880
She's that gold digger, isn't she?

129
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,679
Come on. Why did you lock her up in there? It isn't even our case.

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
What will you do if someone sees her?

131
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,200
We're certain that Han Jin Sook was killed by Woo Byung Sik, right?

132
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Yes. Well, that's how the higher-ups want us to close the case.

133
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
Gwang Gyun went berserk,

134
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
but he has no power, you know.

135
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,920
Anyway, I'm writing the case closure report now.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The killer is this man wearing a watch with a butterfly design...

137
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,080
In other words, Woo Byung Sik's henchman. Right?

138
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,840
Well... Yes.

139
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,440
But why do you ask?

140
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,800
If Woo Byung Sik is dead,

141
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,120
this punk must be on the run or laying low.

142
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,280
If he really is the man without a finger,

143
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,880
why would he kill that girl's boss?

144
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,160
But if this man wasn't Woo Byung Sik...

145
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Excuse me. Please let me out.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,120
My daughter... She needs her medication now.

147
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,840
- What... Medication? - She has a respiratory condition.

148
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
What kind of medicine do you need?

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,880
I left the house determined to kill myself. Of course I didn't bring it.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,160
Let me out now! Please let me go.

151
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,040
I must go home and give her the medication now. Please?

152
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Home?

153
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,120
I must not let her go home.

154
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,320
I'll go to a pharmacy now and pick it up for you.

155
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,360
You can't. You need a prescription to buy it.

156
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,160
Let me out, please.

157
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,480
Then I'll go to your place and bring it. Where is it?

158
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,360
What's going on? Why isn't the light turning on?

159
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,800
The top drawer...

160
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,000
Hey, Byung Ho. Where are you now?

161
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,480
I'm sorry, Man Soo. I was only following orders.

162
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,920
Hello? Hello? Hey, hey!

163
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,320
That jerk...

164
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,120
I caught the bar girl.

165
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,600
Yes, she's alone.

166
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Shall I take care of her?

167
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Yes, sir.

168
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
It's over.

169
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,680
Gosh, it's hot! No!

170
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,000
Darn it. Gosh!

171
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
You little...

172
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,880
Let go. Gosh.

173
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
What?

174
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,600
You're not that jerk.

175
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,560
A sausage?

176
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,360
Did she think that was a finger?

177
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,280
- What... What's happening? - Help...

178
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,040
- Help me... - You didn't die?

179
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,760
Help... Help...

180
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,280
Help me.

181
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,400
Darn it. Why are those punks there?

182
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,280
Ha Ram. Gosh, Ha Ram.

183
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,320
Ha Ram. My gosh!

184
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,400
Ha Ram. Gosh.

185
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,040
Joon, you should go find my boss.

186
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,120
Catch whoever it is that is trying to kill him, okay?

187
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,320
"My boss"? Since when did you call him like that?

188
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
All right.

189
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,840
I'll head over to his cottage as soon as I bring the medication.

190
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Excuse me. Gosh, please let me out.

191
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Hyo Jin.

192
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,000
- Mom. - What should I do? Hyo Jin...

193
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,000
Excuse me. Detective, please let us out.

194
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,280
- Mom. - Please let us go!

195
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,280
Ha Ram, are you okay? Gosh, Ha Ram...

196
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,840
Are you all right? Gosh.

197
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,920
- Mom! - You jerk!

198
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,240
Gosh, Hyo Jin. Are you okay, Hyo Jin?

199
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Gosh, that jerk.

200
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm glad the shadow is gone.

201
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Hold on.

202
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,680
Would they think I saved his life?

203
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,560
No way. He hung on to me.

204
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
I did my best to shake him off.

205
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,480
Yes, the rope broke.

206
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,240
The rope saved him, not me.

207
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,160
I have nothing to do with his survival.

208
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
I'll go to the villa right away.

209
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,440
Kim Sun Young!

210
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,240
You'd better hide yourself well.

211
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,800
- Excuse me. - Let go of me. Let go!

212
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,680
You crazy jerk. How dare you hit her?

213
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,040
- Stop! What are you doing? - How dare you?

214
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,760
- Stop. Go now! - Let go of me.

215
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,600
- Hey! Stop right there! - I'm fine!

216
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Stop it!

217
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,920
Officer Na.

218
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,080
Stop it. I'm fine.

219
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,080
This happens every day.

220
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,880
You're a police officer.

221
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,960
You shouldn't hit others because of someone like me.

222
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,640
Your face...

223
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,320
You're so handsome, darling.

224
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
Here you go.

225
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Okay.

226
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, that's right.

227
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,480
I heard the new commissioner general is a woman.

228
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,320
She's making a fuss about shutting down the bars here...

229
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,080
to crack down on prostitution.

230
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,920
Those girls have nothing but their bodies.

231
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,840
What's so wrong about them selling themselves?

232
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,840
- Am I right? - It is wrong.

233
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,720
You can't pay someone for sexual favors.

234
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,200
You should quit your job too.

235
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,600
Do you think I want to do this?

236
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,760
I have a load of debts, so I can't quit even if I want to.

237
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,000
And what if I did?

238
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,720
How should I make a living?

239
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,920
With this money, you can pay off your debts...

240
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,320
and get a house in Seoul even if it may be small.

241
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,320
Officer Na.

242
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,720
I will make you happy, Clara.

243
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
What a fool.

244
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,080
If you ran away with my money, you should be living a nice life.

245
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,640
Why did you come back like this?

246
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Why?

247
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,160
What kind of a scum did this to you?

248
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
What?

249
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,120
Her shadow is gone?

250
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,800
So this is why humans often say, "It's driving me crazy."

251
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
I got it.

252
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,400
My house?

253
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,240
Yes. The police told us to stay somewhere safe,

254
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,440
but my house is on the rooftop. It's not very safe.

255
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,560
I thought your house would be safer. Please understand.

256
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,440
Fine.

257
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
The password?

258
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,400
It's 4444.

259
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,400
Four fours. I'm hanging up now.

260
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,800
Do you remember anything else about that jerk?

261
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,640
Even just a little thing would be good.

262
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,480
I'm not sure.

263
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,080
He somehow stank a bit.

264
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,560
He stank?

265
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,000
It was a sickening smell.

266
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
It was like the smell of rubber.

267
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,440
The smell of rubber?

268
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Was it...

269
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,320
the smell of mugwort by any chance?

270
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,360
The stink of mugwort.

271
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,480
Come to think of it,

272
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,560
it did smell like mugwort.

273
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,120
That's right.

274
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,120
That bathroom.

275
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,240
It's that smell.

276
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,280
The smell of burning mugwort.

277
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,360
It also smelled like rubber.

278
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,480
I got it. I think I know who that jerk was.

279
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,480
I can't believe you did this again!

280
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,200
When you passed out at the hotel before,

281
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,840
you promised me you'd never do drugs again.

282
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,320
It has been only a month, and you caused trouble again.

283
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,720
I didn't do it.

284
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,360
You'd better stay here and lie low.

285
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,320
Doctor, please keep this a secret like the last time.

286
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,640
Okay.

287
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
I'm doing this as a special favor to someone as well.

288
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,480
- Please take good care of him. - Sure.

289
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,360
All right.

290
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,720
Hello? Yes, I'm on my way out now.

291
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,160
Bodyguard... Bodyguard!

292
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,280
There are no bodyguards, you brat. I caught you, you jerk.

293
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I think I get it now.

294
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,520
Your dad must have hidden you here, right?

295
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,120
He hid you here...

296
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,240
to lay all the blame on your uncle.

297
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,800
No... No. I don't know anything.

298
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,920
I... I don't know.

299
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,480
You don't know? You little...

300
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,200
You'd better tell me the truth before I chop off your tongue...

301
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
and chomp on it, okay?

302
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,200
- I really don't know anything. - Of course you'd say that.

303
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,960
Let's go to the police and see if you really don't know, okay?

304
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,840
You should have a drug test first.

305
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,280
Please. Please let it slide just this once. Please?

306
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,080
How dare you do drugs when you're still wet behind the ears?

307
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,200
Come here. Come here, you brat.

308
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,160
Mister.

309
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,880
Why are you alone? Where is Ha Ram?

310
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,240
She and my mom went outside.

311
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,680
Where did she go this time? Gosh.

312
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,360
What? Give that to me.

313
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,520
No.

314
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,000
- Give it to me. It's not a toy. - No.

315
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,840
It's not a toy.

316
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,000
Give it back. Give it back to me.

317
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,200
- Give it back. - What?

318
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,880
What did you do with the thing inside?

319
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,920
Nothing was inside.

320
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,800
- Was there really nothing inside? - Yes.

321
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Wasn't there an empty, transparent capsule...

322
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
which looks like a toy capsule?

323
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,160
I told you that there was nothing inside.

324
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,360
Darn it. Where did it go?

325
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,560
Ha Ram. Where are you?

326
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,280
Why didn't you call me sooner?

327
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,520
I'm in Mr. Oh's dad's hospital room.

328
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,960
I caught the jerk who assaulted Tiffany.

329
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,840
I cannot believe this.

330
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
Hello?

331
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Hello?

332
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Ha Ram!

333
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
What's going on?

334
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,960
(Loser)

335
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
This woman...

336
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,880
knows that I'm the one who did it.

337
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
What should I do, Dad?

338
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,720
Hide the girl in the trunk quietly without anyone noticing,

339
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,320
and stay right there.

340
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,840
I'll send someone right away.

341
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,120
How could you mess this up?

342
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,080
You can't even handle a bar hostess?

343
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,200
You made things much worse!

344
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I'm sorry.

345
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,800
The car owner. You bought his tongue, right?

346
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Yes.

347
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,960
Security cameras.

348
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,680
Tell the hospital security team to delete the footage! Now!

349
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Delete the footage?

350
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,800
But a detective just checked it already.

351
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,120
6723... 6723.

352
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,640
What is this?

353
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Why isn't it working?

354
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,240
Why can't I teleport again? Why does it have to happen now?

355
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,640
But how did she know it was me?

356
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,200
- Come here. - Hey.

357
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,200
Why didn't you come out of there today?

358
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,880
You're not constipated anymore?

359
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,080
I must find it. 16N6723.

360
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,320
- Hurry. - Get off me, you punk!

361
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,960
Do you think I'm your minion?

362
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,160
Am I your servant?

363
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,200
Find it yourself.

364
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,240
I'm busy peeing.

365
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,240
Please.

366
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,400
Help me, please.

367
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,840
Hey.

368
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,280
He turned left at the main building of the hospital?

369
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,240
He probably crossed Seongju Bridge then.

370
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
Check the security cameras there.

371
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,880
I'm on it.

372
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,640
Here. It's this car, right?

373
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
It is.

374
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,760
Hello?

375
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,200
I'm on my way now.

376
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,480
Yes.

377
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Detective Kim.

378
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Detective Kim.

379
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
- Excuse me. - What?

380
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,880
- What's going on? - Let me use your car.

381
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,600
Detective Han! Hey!

382
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Ha Ram, please stay alive.

383
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,560
I will have a long life until I become an old lady.

384
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,200
If she wants that, why would she meddle in everyone's business?

385
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,840
Anyway, you must stay alive.

386
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,160
If you die now, no grim reapers can come to take you!

387
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,880
Where is she? Could it be...

388
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,520
Somebody!

389
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,560
Help!

390
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,560
Help me!

391
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,360
Help me, please!

392
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,680
Why is she in there?

393
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,000
Help!

394
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,400
- Help! - That idiot.

395
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,080
All right. Okay.

396
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,400
Stop the car, you punk!

397
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,720
Would you?

398
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,000
Stop the car!

399
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,840
Where have you been? Captain Bong looked all over for you.

400
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,600
Where is the report on the skeleton?

401
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,920
- Why? - Give me a second.

402
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,320
- Where is it? - Here.

403
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,880
What? Is this all?

404
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
What do you mean?

405
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
"What do you mean?"

406
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,680
You idiot. Do you think this is a proper report?

407
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,760
Are you discriminating people?

408
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,720
You do everything you can for Woo Byung Sik and Han Jin Sook's case.

409
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,080
Do you think this is an abandoned skeleton of nobody? Is that it?

410
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,320
Don't consider yourselves detectives.

411
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,760
I'm not even in charge of that case.

412
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,640
- It was Moo Gang's. - Shut it.

413
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,480
Hi, it's me.

414
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,920
Do you remember the skeleton we found in the mountain?

415
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,040
The one Moo Gang threw up on.

416
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,120
Yes. Could you...

417
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,600
run tests on the skeleton again and do it thoroughly?

418
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,520
Please do this for me.

419
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,840
Yes, call me if you find anything.

420
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,760
Okay.

421
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,120
Darn it. Why did Moo Gang hide it?

422
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
No.

423
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,480
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

424
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,560
Ha Ram. Ha Ram?

425
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Wake up.

426
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,880
Wake up!

427
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Ha Ram.

428
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,560
I decided that I would never die.

429
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,880
I decided to survive...

430
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,720
no matter what happens.

431
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,280
All right. You're okay, right?

432
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,120
No. No.

433
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,120
Joon. Joon.

434
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,560
Wake up.

435
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,280
No, Joon.

436
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,640
How dare you!

437
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
I'm glad...

438
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,600
you're alive.

439
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,840
Joon. Joon, wake up.

440
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,200
- My gosh, she's so loud. - Joon. No.

441
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,840
- Please wake up. - She's so annoying.

442
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,360
Ha Ram.

443
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Joon.

444
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,600
You're nothing. How dare you?

445
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,200
Do you even know who I am?

446
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,200
I'm going to kill you!

447
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,560
No! No!

448
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,360
You better keep this in mind.

449
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,840
Don't lock eyesight with a human that's fallen in love.

450
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,120
If you do,

451
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,120
something tragic will happen to you.

452
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,760
Please wake up, Joon.

453
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,880
Don't die. Please don't die.

454
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,840
Oh Man Soo of Royeol Insurance was known to be the culprit...

455
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,080
of the recent rape attempt. However, it turns out...

456
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,440
that the real culprit was Royeol Group's eldest son,

457
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,640
Oh Sang Min.

458
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,200
He abducted a civilian,

459
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,480
and he stole a car to escape from the police.

460
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,840
However, he got caught by Detective Han Moo Gang...

461
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,720
of Seoun Police Station's homicide department.

462
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,200
In that process, the abducted civilian...

463
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,920
and Detective Han both got injured and were transferred to a hospital.

464
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,240
Thankfully, their injuries were not that severe.

465
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,320
- Moo Gang. - The motive behind...

466
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,960
- You were alive? - Oh Sang Min's...

467
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,920
criminal act is yet unknown.

468
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,440
Since the culprit wasn't severely injured...

469
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,240
and has been arrested on the spot,

470
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,040
the police stated that they'll start investigating right away.

471
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,480
The phone is turned off.

472
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,320
Please leave a message after the tone. After you're connected...

473
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,200
Please connect me to Seoun Police Station's homicide department.

474
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,600
Hello?

475
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,360
Is Detective Han there?

476
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,600
He's not in the office right now.

477
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
I...

478
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,320
I was kidnapped, but I just escaped.

479
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,720
Yes, okay. We'll go there right away.

480
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,800
Hey, it's me.

481
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,040
I know where Yoon Soo Wan is.

482
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,080
Hey, over here...

483
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
How dare you try to escape?

484
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,760
The culprit of the attempted rape case turned out to be...

485
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,960
the only son of Royeol Group's CEO Oh Man Ho,

486
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,320
who is also the nephew of Oh Man Soo.

487
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm sorry, but I had every reason to be suspicious of you.

488
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,560
I saw you coming out...

489
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,880
from Oh Man Soo's room after the assault incident that day.

490
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,400
But if you were in that room, you would've seen her get injured.

491
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,680
Why didn't you say anything?

492
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,160
Due to what happened, the campaign that was...

493
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,840
- being organized by... - To be honest,

494
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,880
I was secretly doing drugs in Man Soo's room because it was empty.

495
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,400
So I didn't really know what was going on.

496
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,560
You know what happens when I get high.

497
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,880
My gosh, I can't believe this. What is wrong with you?

498
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,320
Don't tell the CEO.

499
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,160
I'll really quit this time, so please turn a blind eye.

500
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,400
What... What?

501
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
(Females and Juveniles Department)

502
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,640
Then Let us begin.

503
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,240
Can you tell me what happened at the party?

504
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,840
I can't remember because I was drunk.

505
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,200
He can't remember.

506
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,120
Then you could've just said...

507
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,440
that you didn't remember anything in the first place.

508
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,720
Why did you have to mess with a cop and make things so complicated?

509
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,640
I didn't mean to do that to him.

510
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,880
But he started attacking me first.

511
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,920
It was self-defense.

512
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,120
Then I guess this is self-defense.

513
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Have you ever...

514
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,800
received any psychological treatment?

515
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,880
Yes, he has.

516
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,440
He had experienced shock because of his parents' divorce.

517
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,520
I see. You've received psychological therapy for two years.

518
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,440
What are you doing here?

519
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,120
What a load of nonsense.

520
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,960
Who are you? My gosh.

521
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,440
"Mental illness"?

522
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,960
How much money did you receive from Royeol Group?

523
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,520
My gosh, you're an embarrassment.

524
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,000
Who are you?

525
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,320
Shall I get a few DNA samples now?

526
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,360
Who do you think you are?

527
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,160
- Seriously. - What are you doing?

528
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,120
They already took his DNA sample.

529
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,640
Mr. Lawyer, sit back down.

530
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,120
I have a really bad personality, so I have trouble trusting people.

531
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,280
What if someone swaps his sample with someone else's?

532
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,840
- Hey. - Yes, sir.

533
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,760
Keep your eyes on this, and bring me the results.

534
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Yes, sir.

535
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,800
What do you think you're doing?

536
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,400
Our department is in charge of handling this case.

537
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,960
This case is mine.

538
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
That guy...

539
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,720
That young fool...

540
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
was arrested by our team recruit.

541
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,080
So it's our case now.

542
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,360
Didn't you hear that yet?

543
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,240
Who says that?

544
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,520
(Special Written Order)

545
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,320
"Seoun Police Station's Support Team".

546
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,960
"Established in 2016 as a new team underneath..."

547
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,560
"the homicide department,"

548
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,760
"this team shall be the first in line..."

549
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,280
"to take on a case that has been recognized by them..."

550
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,920
"or that was asked by another police station..."

551
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,560
"for support and assistance."

552
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,160
You saw what's written here, right?

553
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Look.

554
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,520
It was stamped by the chief of Seoun Police Station himself.

555
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,280
My gosh, I can't believe this.

556
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,720
Now, let's start a proper investigation.

557
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,520
What do you think you're doing?

558
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,920
I'm just doing this because he's cute.

559
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Hey.

560
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,960
Do you know what my nickname is?

561
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,680
They call me Crazy Dog. Crazy Dog.

562
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,080
That's because I never let go of whatever I bite.

563
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,480
No. No.

564
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,920
Joon. Joon. Wake up.

565
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
No. Joon.

566
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Joon.

567
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,400
Are you okay? Did you get hurt badly?

568
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,600
Stop causing a fuss. I'm fine.

569
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,840
Thank you, Joon.

570
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,040
You saved my life again.

571
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
What?

572
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,480
You always save my life like this.

573
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,400
I feel like I always put you in danger and make you get injured.

574
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,640
Tiffany and Hyo Jin were here until a while ago.

575
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,760
They left after waiting for you to wake up.

576
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,880
Tiffany's shadow has completely disappeared.

577
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,840
Thanks to you,

578
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,720
Mr. Oh, Tiffany, and Hyo Jin all managed to stay alive.

579
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,640
You're incredible, Joon.

580
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,800
Why is that because of me?

581
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,240
I didn't save your boss.

582
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,600
I wasn't even trying to help. He's the one who clung onto me.

583
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,920
And I have absolutely nothing to do with...

584
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,960
Tiffany and that little girl being able to stay alive.

585
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,920
You're so modest.

586
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,240
I'm not being modest.

587
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,800
I didn't save anyone.

588
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,160
I don't save human beings.

589
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,560
No, Joon. Joon, No.

590
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
Why?

591
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,600
I... I'm a mess, aren't I?

592
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,120
I should've at least washed my face. Seriously.

593
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
Ha Ram.

594
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,800
From now on,

595
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,720
I want you to stay by my side. Okay?

596
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,480
What... What?

597
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,120
You promised...

598
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,120
that you'll stay by my side.

599
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,320
What... What? Oh, okay.

600
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,160
Yes, but your mother told me...

601
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,000
not to stay here for long, so I should go now.

602
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,800
Rest up, Joon.

603
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,200
The capsule. I forgot about the capsule.

604
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
It's working again.

605
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,920
Then why won't it work when I really need it?

606
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,400
Anyway, where's that capsule?

607
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,560
Where is that capsule.

608
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,480
It's not here.

609
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
The capsule. The capsule.

610
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,920
Gosh, where is it?

611
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
I'm sorry.

612
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,120
I should've given this to you a long time ago.

613
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,320
I was being too selfish.

614
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,320
Dad, what's going to happen to me?

615
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,040
There's this crazy detective.

616
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,800
He keeps saying that he'll tear me into pieces.

617
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,680
Don't worry. You'll get released soon.

618
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Really?

619
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,360
Will I really get released, dad?

620
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,560
Of course. You're a minor and a first-time offender.

621
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
He's right.

622
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,200
The juvenile act focuses on reformation rather than punishment.

623
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,680
So even if one commits murder, they rarely get punished.

624
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,720
What about weed?

625
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,680
They took my hair sample.

626
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,320
Just say that you thought it was a cigarette.

627
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,240
You already agreed to the DNA test.

628
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,800
So if you plead that you never intended on getting rid of evidence,

629
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,800
they'll reject the warrant.

630
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,520
Your visiting time's over.

631
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Don't worry.

632
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,840
It was you, wasn't it? You did this, didn't you?

633
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,480
What do you think you're doing?

634
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,600
You knew that it was Sang Min, didn't you?

635
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,920
That's why you tried to blame everything on me!

636
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,360
Hey.

637
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,960
If you stayed quiet, she would've become a gold digger,

638
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,040
and you would've gotten released by being proved innocent.

639
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,800
And even if you did get blamed for everything,

640
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,480
you're already an ex-convict. How will that change anything?

641
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,800
Then did you try to kill me...

642
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,680
because things didn't go your way? Is that it?

643
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,880
What? What are you talking about?

644
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,240
Stop pretending like you don't know!

645
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,400
I noticed that you got rid of all the evidence already.

646
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,920
Do you think that will prevent me from proving that it was your doing?

647
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,600
What are you talking about? You little jerk.

648
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,520
I'm not going to get beaten up by you anymore.

649
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,000
Has that jerk gone mad?

650
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,360
We're in trouble, sir.

651
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,960
I think Man Soo knows.

652
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,560
What are you talking about? What does Man Soo know?

653
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,600
I think he knows that he's not the culprit.

654
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,600
Hey, Byung Ho.

655
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,640
Did you tell him the truth?

656
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,160
Do you think you'll get away with giving weed to Sang Min like this?

657
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,400
I really didn't tell him anything.

658
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,840
That bar hostess must've noticed something.

659
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,640
Man Soo's in front of my house right now.

660
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,360
What should I do?

661
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,840
Call Man Soo, and ask him...

662
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,720
to meet you at the summer house.

663
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,120
And I want you to keep your mouth shut and go into hiding.

664
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,840
What's wrong, Dad?

665
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,760
Did something go wrong?

666
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,080
Did I get caught?

667
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
Am I going to prison?

668
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,360
Don't worry.

669
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,560
Everything will be fine as long as your uncle keeps quiet.

670
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,560
But what is that jerk planning to do?

671
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,040
Gosh.

672
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
What...

673
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,720
Did... Did a thief break in?

674
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,840
It's not here.

675
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,640
I searched the entire house, but it's not here.

676
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Gosh.

677
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,880
I'm sure it'll be here as long as someone didn't throw it away.

678
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,200
What if someone took it?

679
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,720
If it was stolen by a human,

680
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,480
it'll just seem like an empty capsule.

681
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,240
And they won't be able to open it, so it'll be fine.

682
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,000
But...

683
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,960
if it was stolen by a grim reaper, it becomes a serious problem.

684
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,720
The moment that grim reaper opens that capsule...

685
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,560
Will... Will Ha Rim end up dying then?

686
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,080
Will that start the countdown of her death?

687
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,440
My gosh, stop it already, would you?

688
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,400
Ha Rim can never die without my permission.

689
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,480
Why?

690
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,360
Why does her death need your permission?

691
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,400
Why... Why do you think? I need her eyes to catch that loser.

692
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,920
I'm going to take her as soon as I catch that loser. Don't worry.

693
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,120
Then you better protect her well...

694
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,400
because we have no idea when and how she'll end up dying.

695
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,840
The only way for you to do that is to stay by her side at all times.

696
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,880
"At all times"?

697
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,240
At all times.

698
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,480
Don't tell me that it fell into the hands of another grim reaper.

699
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Is Moo Gang not picking up yet?

700
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,520
What in the world is he up to?

701
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,160
Give me that. I'll do it.

702
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,720
Really?

703
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,800
Then I'll go and check on the soup in the kitchen.

704
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,840
Okay.

705
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,800
I knew it.

706
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,800
444 is in Moo Gang's body now.

707
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,760
So...

708
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,120
444 has...

709
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,160
fallen for a woman?

He'll die anyway.

Why is he sleeping here?

714
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,080
He already took it off.

715
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,600

Get back here!

What? Is he the man I saw in Han Moo Gang's dream?

728
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,280
I must track him down.

00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,720
He doesn't live here.

731
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,000
Then do you know anything about the previous tenant...

732
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,560
Goodness, I've lived here for more than a decade, okay?

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,280
There's no record of him moving elsewhere.

Then...

737
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,160
From this report, it looks like...

738
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,000
a TV show on the local channel covered the arson case.

739
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,280
Wouldn't we be able to find some clues...

740
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,640
if we go ask the director of the show?

741
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,440
(Detective Kang Soo Hyuk also found out that the show was covering it.)

We didn't actually broadcast anything about this case.

752
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,400
Yes, I do remember the case.

753
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
You do?

754
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,360
I used to know a detective in Moojin.

755
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,400
When I was having a drink with him,

756
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,960
I heard that the case might not have been a simple arson case...

757
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,200
but a murder case.

758
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,000
So I started collecting information right away.

759
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,480
But I had to stop in the middle of it.

760
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,040
Why is that?

761
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,480
It was because of the Moojin Time Mart collapse.

762
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,760
I didn't have time to work on any other stories.

763
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,200
It was one of the biggest disasters in history, you know.

764
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,560
Everyone was all over the place back then.

765
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,360
But why are you asking me about the case out of the blue?

766
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,120
Do you know of anyone or his family members who might know where he is?

767
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,640
Well... I'm not sure if you know this,

768
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,160
but the victim's husband is Korean-Chinese.

769
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,320
I heard that he moved to Korea after marrying her.

770
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,880
As far as I know, he has no family here.

Oh, that's right.

772
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,320
The victim had a younger sister.

773
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,680
Yes, I remember meeting her while working on the case.

774
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,000
Could we get her contact information by any chance?

775
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,200
Well, I'm not sure if I still have her contact information.

but it was such a long time ago.

He... He died?

815
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,480
He went back to China...

816
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,320
about two months after my sister died,

817
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,160
so I lost touch with him too after that.

818

819
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,680
I got a call from the police in Shenzhen.

820
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,480
They said that he died...

821
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,160
and that they want me to come and confirm that it's him.

822
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,120
I think he got into a fight with someone while playing mahjong.

823
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,440
I got him cremated right away...

824

and scattered his ashes there.

01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,560
Dad...

826
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,960
He died.

827
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,840
That jerk.

828
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,600
I knew that he'd get the punishment he deserved.

829
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,640
I'm sorry, Dad.

830
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,000
I'm really sorry.

831
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,840
I'm sorry that I got you killed.

832
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,600
It's all my fault.

833
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,360
I shouldn't have seen...

834
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,400
the shadow on that woman.

835
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,480
A fire will break out at her place,

836
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,120
and her clothes will catch fire.

837
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,840
But it's strange.

838
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,680
She's just staying still.

839
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,920
She must be hot.

840
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,600
Why isn't she moving?

841
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,200
What?

842
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,920
On the woman's belly,

843
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,400
a piece of yellow paper is burning.

844
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,440
She has a towel around her neck.

845
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,040
I was too young to know then.

846
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,560
When I looked back,

847
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,880
I realized that the woman was killed by her husband.

848
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,800
You reckoned that, didn't you?

849
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,600
If I didn't touch the shadow,

850
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You wouldn't have investigated the case.

851
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,720
Then that man...

852
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,480
wouldn't have killed you.

853
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,920
I'm sorry, Dad.

854
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,960
I must have thought...

855
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,560
that you would live once the shadow disappeared.

856
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,080
I thought you wouldn't die.

857
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,280
I tried to get rid of it,

858
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,440
but it was pointless.

859
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,040
In the end, you died.

860
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,360
You and my dad...

861
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,040
used to be like a real father and son.

862
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,600
I was so jealous of you.

863
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,720
I insisted that I'd go to the men's bath with him.

864
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,200
Do you remember...

865
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,880
why you became a police officer?

866
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,960
It's probably because of my dad.

867
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,920
After meeting my dad,

868
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,280
You told me...

869
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,520
that you wanted to be someone for the first time.

870
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,000
You told me...

871
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,040
that you wanted to be an amazing detective like my dad.

872
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,440
Stop right there, you punk.

873
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,000
Who are you?

874
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,760
Me? I'm a police officer.

875
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,640
You're too young to steal.

876
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,760
Let's go.

877
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,720
Dad. Please, Dad.

878
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,280
Eat. They're getting soggy.

879
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,840
You said you'll put me in jail.

880
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,640
For now, let's eat first.

881
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,280
You should try some. It's delicious.

882
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,320
Soon after that,

883
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,320
you went to your dad's in Seoul.

884
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,560
And dad passed away a year later.

885
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,000
Ever since then,

886
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,320
I've never been happy even for a moment.

887
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,640
I couldn't see Dad anymore.

888
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,280
But I imagined that you were somewhere in this world...

889
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,120
and lived on while enduring the pain.

890
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,280
You were...

891
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,720
like a support...

892
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,200
that kept my life going.

893
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:23,279
When she finds out that Han Moo Gang is dead...

894
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Kim Sun Young.

895
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,399
How dare you stab me?

896
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:01,439
Kim Sun Young.

897
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,040
This is your last chance.

898
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,479
Where's the tape?

899
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,080
I don't know.

900
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,319
- Where is it? - I don't know.

901
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:21,120
Where's the tape?

902
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,880
Tell me!

903
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
Don't hit her! Don't hit my sister!

904
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,120
What? Who are you?

905
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,800
- Don't hit her! - What are you?

906
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,880
Come here, you punk.

907
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,279
No.

908
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,359
No.

909
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,640
I saw him in the photo.

910
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,520
"Han Moo Gang".

911
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,520
What?

912
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,560
Isn't Joon and Han Moo Gang the same person?

913
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,600
Come here, you punk.

914
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,240
No, Moo Gang.

915
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,760
Wait.

916
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,480
Moo Chan.

917
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,280
What?

918
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,000
Does that mean Joon isn't Han Moo Gang?

919
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,000
(Black)

920
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,880
Are you telling me to spare him?

921
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,080
If he dies, Seok also dies.

922
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,440
I must find proof that they tried to kill me.

923
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,680
I think that's where he was murdered.

924
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,840
Where is that factory?

925
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,920
What were you investigating all alone, Moo Gang?

926
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,080
Joon.

927
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,160
Have you forgotten that you're the Grim Reaper?

928
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,680
What were you investigating until now?

929
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,720
Get off me. Are you insane?

930
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,880
I wish I had a face too.
