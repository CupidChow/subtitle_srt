1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,920
Say it!

2
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,160
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,320
Tell me now.

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,560
I... I don't know.

5
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,440
You don't know? Then I shall make you remember it.

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,760
Raise your head.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,000
Where is the tape?

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm asking you where it is!

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,000
The tape! The tape!

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,280
Say it! Tell me where it is!

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
Why do I keep dreaming as Han Moo Gang?

12
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,080
Tape?

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,960
Could it be that one?

14
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,759
What?

15
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,039
Who emptied out this place?

16
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,960
Catch that wench, and bring her here.

17
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,640
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
I don't want to do this.

19
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Why?

20
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,480
I can't do it.

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,320
I won't do it.

22
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,760
Don't you want to get into medical school?

23
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,440
Don't you?

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,160
I heard that your parents died without getting any treatment...

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,600
because they had no money...

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,920
when they got injured by the car accident.

27
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,079
Isn't that when you made up your mind...

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
to become a doctor?

29
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Who will pay the expensive tuition fees for your medical school?

30
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,760
Who?

31
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,320
Joon's mom said she'd pay for your university education.

32
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,920
But what are you going to do now?

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,640
She's behind bars now.

34
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,200
And even when she's released,

35
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,480
there's no guarantee that she'll help you out financially.

36
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,480
Forget it if you don't want to do it.

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,000
Just work as a kitchen helper at bars for the rest of your life.

38
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,280
Wait!

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,360
I'll do it.

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
Good.

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,040
I'm glad to hear that.

42
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
What happened?

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,280
He tried to threaten a girl with a knife to rape her...

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,720
but ended up getting stabbed by his own knife.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Doctor!

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,640
What are you doing now?

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
- How did he get injured? - You don't know?

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,520
Bring gauzes and compression bandages over here. Hurry up.

49
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,760
- Hold this. - Yes, doctor.

50
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,640
Moo Gang, what brings you here at this hour...

51
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
Did... Did you get hurt or something?

52
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
Did you take those things?

53
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,160
- What things? - Everything in the basement room.

54
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,920
I saw you walking out of that room a while back.

55
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,880
They're gone? Everything in that room is gone?

56
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,720
It wasn't this woman's doing.

57
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,160
By any chance,

58
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
is there anything you know about a tape?

59
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,240
Tape... Tape? What are you talking about?

60
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,880
I keep having dreams...

61
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,000
where someone keeps asking for a tape.

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,360
Dreams?

63
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,320
No, I don't know anything about it.

64
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Could that mean...

65
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,880
you're regaining your memory?

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,800
Those dreams are very unpleasant.

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
That... That jerk must've taken it.

68
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,240
Who did it if it wasn't the doctor's doing?

69
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,120
Did that man try to carve out Han Moo Gang's eyeballs...

70
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,520
to open this door?

71
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,560
It must've been him.

72
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,680
Detective, what brings you to my place at this early hour?

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,800
This. What is this?

74
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh, that. It's my business card.

75
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,360
My dream is to become a famous trot singer.

76
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,240
My nickname is Singing Pumpkin.

77
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
My wife drew this herself.

78
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,920
- This is your wife's drawing? - Yes.

79
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,400
Did she come up with the idea for the drawing herself?

80
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
Well... She said that she got the idea from a drawing...

81
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,640
on a sign of a store where she worked for when she was young.

82
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
But why do you ask?

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,040
Is Ms. Han's hometown Moojin by any chance?

84
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,320
Yes, I told the detective who visited me the other day.

85
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,040
He took Jin Sook's childhood photo as well...

86
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,440
and said it's needed for the investigation.

87
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,800
You mean this photo?

88
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,960
Yes.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
Jin Sook...

90
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,240
Yes. I sent Han Jin Sook's call history.

91
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,200
Han Jin Sook? That's our case.

92
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
Gosh, I'm so tired. Oh, boy.

93
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,360
(Lee Min Joon, Yoon Soo Wan)

94
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,440
Kim Sun Young must've been Han Moo Gang's girlfriend.

95
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,800
You look dashing.

96
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,880
- My goodness. - Your face

97
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,600
Is filled with worries and concerns

98
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,760
You can't let go of your countless regrets

99
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,720
You poor Grim Reaper

100
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
About dreams that humans have...

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Dreams? Please have mercy on us.

102
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,760
I keep having those dreams.

103
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,680
What are they about?

104
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,920
They feel so real.

105
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,760
I think they're about Han Moo Gang's childhood.

106
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,640
They're probably just his memories left in his brain...

107
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,040
being expressed through his body.

108
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,760
They mean nothing more.

109
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,400
Memories left in his brain?

110
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,080
That's right.

111
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,160
They say that the brain leaves afterimages even after humans die.

112
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,920
The human brain is such a complex and fascinating thing.

113
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
- 007. - Yes.

114
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,240
My mom told me that you're a total liar

115
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,000
You rude brat.

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,480
I'm old enough to be your ancestor. How dare you cut me off?

117
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,640
Anyway, I'm worried.

118
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,320
You may have side effects soon.

119
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,640
Please have mercy on us. All is vanity.

120
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,360
- Side effects? - That's right.

121
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,680
You might not be able to teleport as you please.

122
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,240
I can't teleport? Why not?

123
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,720
You have dreams now.

124
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,360
That means you're becoming more and more human.

125
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,240
Humans cannot teleport, can they?

126
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,360
- So you may also... - Becoming a human?

127
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,240
I'm becoming like those uncivilized humans?

128
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,560
My gosh. This is so humiliating and unpleasant.

129
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,800
I can't stand this anymore.

130
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,400
I should find that loser today and get out of this body.

131
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,960
Ha Ram. Where are you now?

132
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
Yes.

133
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,640
Joon!

134
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,480
She has to help me so I can get this done quickly.

135
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,680
Becoming a human? That's nonsense.

136
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,640
Let's go.

137
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,200
How clumsy you are.

138
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,480
Gosh, it hurts. It really hurts.

139
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,040
It won't kill you. Come with me.

140
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,360
You should've caught me. He wasn't like that before.

141
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,840
I know he lost his memories, but how could he change so much?

142
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,400
- It hurts. - What are you doing?

143
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,480
Here. Grab me.

144
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,040
Not my hand.

145
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,760
Here. Grab the end of my sleeve.

146
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,640
You let some woman touch your chest.

147
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,960
- You don't want to? - No, wait. Gosh.

148
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
Okay.

149
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,360
Goodness.

150
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,120
But why do I have to find shadows inside of people who approach her?

151
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,520
Well, she's a suspect of a serial murder case.

152
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,520
A suspect of a serial murder case?

153
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,040
Yes.

154
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,760
But she looks like a person who couldn't even hurt a fly.

155
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,880
Right?

156
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,520
However,

157
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,120
the more brutal the murderer is,

158
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,880
they usually have a face of an ordinary person, okay?

159
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,320
So stay sharp, and watch people carefully.

160
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
Not me but over there. Watch people over there.

161
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,640
That person. Look at that person.

162
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
- Look inside of his body. - Okay.

163
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,400
Do you see anything?

164
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,920
No, he doesn't have a shadow around him.

165
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,040
Not around him. Look inside of his body. Inside.

166
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,600
I can't really see it because he's facing the other way.

167
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,000
Go check then. Hurry.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,080
Be more enthusiastic. Come on.

169
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,520
It's already tiring to help him, and now he wants me to be enthusiastic.

170
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
That hurts.

171
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,160
Excuse me! Excuse me.

172
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,080
Wait!

173
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,480
What is it? Does he have it?

174
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,520
He does.

175
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,080
- He does? - He does.

176
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,600
- Gosh, how much is this? - It's not much.

177
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,960
Stop! Stop!

178
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
- Loser! - Joon!

179
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Darn it. Hey!

180
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
- Hey, you! - Get off me.

181
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,880
Let go of me!

182
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,640
Come on. You can't just get away like that.

183
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,000
Hey, you should pay for my boys' injuries.

184
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,240
What?

185
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,760
You're that crazy jerk from before.

186
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,160
He... He's a detective.

187
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,080
Yes, he's that crazy detective.

188
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,840
- Yes. - You've become quite stylish.

189
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,160
Move, Baldy.

190
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,840
No, I won't.

191
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,400
You little...

192
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
Hey!

193
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Stop him!

194
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,200
I almost caught him!

195
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
Joon, are you okay? Are... Are you hurt?

196
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
Are you sure he had a shadow inside him?

197
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,960
Yes, I saw it.

198
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,760
- Do you remember his face? - No. He was wearing a big helmet.

199
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,800
I told you to be more enthusiastic!

200
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,680
Darn it!

201
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,640
That customer is my late son's friend.

202
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,680
He comes and buys a lot of my carp bread from time to time.

203
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,560
What's his name? What does he do?

204
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
I don't know.

205
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,440
How old is he?

206
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,240
He's in his mid 40s.

207
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,120
Anyway, he's a swindler.

208
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,080
- If he comes again, call me. - A swindler?

209
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,120
He wouldn't be able to get anything from me.

210
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,480
By the way, you look very familiar.

211
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh, it's you, right?

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,880
You're the one who wandered around in a hospital gown, right?

213
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,240
What are you talking about?

214
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,600
You must have terrible eyesight, don't you?

215
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Call me.

216
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,200
Joon. Joon!

217
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,880
Darn it. I almost had him.

218
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,080
Why did that fool have to tumble there and ruin everything?

219
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,960
You said she was a suspect of a serial murder case.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,960
Why is she involved with a swindler?

221
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,760
No detective tells someone confidential information.

222
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,280
This is top secret. Top secret.

223
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,400
Top secret? What are you talking about?

224
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,280
It's literally top secret!

225
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,320
Stop asking questions. Just stay by my side,

226
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
and do a proper job as my eyes...

227
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,200
if you want to save people's lives.

228
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Goodness.

229
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,800
What was all that about?

230
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,960
Those are all side effects of his head injury, right?

231
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,360
Joon, wait for me.

232
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,280
What should we do after this?

233
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,600
Let's put this in too.

234
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
Welcome.

235
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,640
It's so good.

236
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,440
That's right.

237
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
I knew you'd come here, Loser.

238
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,760
How dare you put me into trouble?

239
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,080
What? Who are you?

240
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,280
Come here. Move it!

241
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,520
You can't just leave me behind. You walk so fast.

242
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,200
- Seriously. - I got him. He has it, right?

243
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,760
Has what?

244
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,520
You know. A shadow.

245
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,960
No, he doesn't.

246
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,400
Are you okay? Let him go. What's going on here?

247
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,480
He doesn't have it?

248
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Look closely. He must have it inside his body.

249
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,080
I said he doesn't.

250
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,079
Let him go already.

251
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,280
You said he had it earlier.

252
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,359
At the market? That guy had it.

253
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,440
By any chance, did you think this man was him?

254
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,680
His helmet looks totally different from the one that guy was wearing.

255
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,079
Let him go. Let go of him first.

256
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,160
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,600
- I'm sorry. - What's your problem, you jerk?

258
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,200
You all saw it, right?

259
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,800
The police... Call the police!

260
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
- What did he do that for? - I'm so sorry.

261
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,160
- Darn it. - Oh, dear.

262
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,440
- I can't open my eyes. - I'm sorry.

263
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
My eyes.

264
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,360
I'm starving.

265
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,240
Take a look around,

266
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,880
and see if anyone has a shadow inside.

267
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,120
Gosh, that's enough.

268
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,440
I'm thankful that you're helping me save people's lives,

269
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,240
but you seem to be obsessed with it.

270
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,960
Take a closer look, okay?

271
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,240
We don't have time to eat this. Don't you understand?

272
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,840
Look, they're leaving.

273
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Everyone is leaving.

274
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,920
- They have all left! - They don't have it!

275
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,400
I've looked at them all.

276
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,880
Are you sure?

277
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,960
That's strange.

278
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,080
Why wouldn't he show up around his sister either?

279
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,440
Why do humans like this red thing that much?

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,640
It doesn't look good at all.

281
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,160
It's really delicious. Do you want to try it?

282
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
- Try just one bite. - No.

283
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,480
- It's good. Just try... - No.

284
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,640
Forget it then.

285
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,400
What's wrong with this food?

286
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,720
It's a bit spicy, right?

287
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,800
They make it quite spicy here.

288
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,280
But it's still tasty and addictive.

289
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,640
It tastes peculiar.

290
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Don't you think?

291
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,880
Are they shooting a romance film or what?

292
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,680
Do they think they're Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won?

293
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,680
Even Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won...

294
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,040
can't make the soup in tteokbokki look romantic.

295
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,200
That's true.

296
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,360
Thanks for the food, Soo Young.

297
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,920
Did the man riding the scooter give you pocket money again?

298
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,040
Who is he anyway?

299
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,560
He said he's my brother's friend.

300
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,400
I'll go to the bathroom for a moment, Joon.

301
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,880
Gosh, that made me lose my appetite.

302
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,280
That obnoxious jerk.

303
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
Are the rumors true?

304
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,920
I heard your brother took his own life because Leo bullied him.

305
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,360
He didn't just bully him.

306
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,280
That jerk practically killed my brother.

307
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,560
He probably can't even rest in peace because it's so unfair.

308
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,400
I bet he became a ghost and latched onto him.

309
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,720
What a jerk.

310
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Hey, Leo! If you have any decency,

311
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,080
you can't steal my girlfriend like that!

312
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,240
Did I look like a total idiot and pushover to you?

313
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,320
Gosh, that punk. Why does he have to talk so much?

314
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,000
Just jump already, will you?

315
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,880
I'll become a ghost...

316
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,080
and latch onto you to take my revenge!

317
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,880
Why did I remember it just now?

318
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,760
Yes, he must've gone into a human body to get back at that jerk.

319
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,720
- Leo! - Leo!

320
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,600
- Leo! - Leo, I love you!

321
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,120
- Leo! - Leo, please look at me!

322
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,240
- Leo! - Leo!

323
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,200
- Look at me, Leo! - I love you, Leo!

324
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
You're back.

325
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,120
Oh, hey. Do you want some?

326
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,520
Your fan must've left this here for you.

327
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,800
No, I hate things like that.

328
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
What are these?

329
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,160
Isn't this blood?

330
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Blood?

331
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,040
There's no post stamp either.

332
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,560
Gosh, you're giving me the creeps. Hey, don't open it.

333
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,000
(You'll end up regretting your past deeds to the bone.)

334
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
(I'll make you fall into the fiery pit, so brace yourself.)

335
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,560
What's wrong? What does it say?

336
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,800
What brings a detective to my place?

337
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Have you seen any suspicious people around?

338
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
- Oh, actually... - No.

339
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,280
You haven't?

340
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,680
I'm sure you have.

341
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,800
Try to remember. I'm sure...

342
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
I told you not to let riffraff into my house.

343
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,240
- Me? Are you talking about... - What time is the live show today?

344
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,920
Oh, it starts at 8pm.

345
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,880
But you must participate in the rehearsal,

346
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,000
so we should get there by around 3pm.

347
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,800
Since when did I participate in rehearsals?

348
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,480
Wake me up at 6pm.

349
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,360
That rude punk.

350
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,520
How obnoxious.

351
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,120
Wait, sir.

352
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,840
- What is it? - Actually, there's...

353
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Here.

354
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
What is that?

355
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,840
Who sent this?

356
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,560
I have no idea either.

357
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,840
Leo doesn't think it's a big deal. He told me not to tell anyone.

358
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,040
But I'm worried.

359
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,560
It's blood, isn't it?

360
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,400
As you know, Leo is a top star.

361
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,600
He's always had all sorts of crazy, obsessive fans,

362
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,760
but I personally think that's out of line.

363
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,920
Please catch whoever did this, but don't disclose it to the media.

364
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,600
Help... Help me.

365
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
Ambulance... Please call an ambulance for me.

366
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,080
He took off like that. How can he pretend not to know me?

367
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,760
Gosh, why did he bring me here?

368
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,280
He should've let me come with him. How could he go in alone?

369
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,200
Why on earth are we here?

370
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,400
I received a report.

371
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,400
Someone is after Leo.

372
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,480
Who'd dare do this to our dear Leo?

373
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,440
This person should just die alone.

374
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,800
What? "You and your most precious treasures..."

375
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,560
All right. Leo is in danger now,

376
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,760
so you must keep a watchful eye on everyone around him.

377
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Got it?

378
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,840
Did you take those things?

379
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,400
- What things? - Everything in the basement room.

380
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,680
If he took all the documents from Moo Gang's investigation,

381
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,600
it means he got his hands on that tape too.

382
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,240
He must've seen my face in it as well.

383
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,360
Then it's only a matter of time before he finds out who I really am.

384
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,400
He'll kill me like that too.

385
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,120
(Letter of Resignation)

386
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,560
Is there a person named Yoon Soo Wan here?

387
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,280
Doctor Yoon, are you leaving for the day?

388
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,680
- What should we do? - Excuse me. Doctor!

389
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,400
- Call a doctor for this patient. - Gosh!

390
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,280
Are you all right?

391
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,960
Move out of the way! This patient needs urgent treatment.

392
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,000
Please be careful. Doctor.

393
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
What happened to him?

394
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,400
He got injured in a traffic accident.

395
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,400
Santorini... Singing Pumpkin.

396
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,080
I can't figure this out.

397
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,200
If Han Jin Sook worked at Pumpkin Singer 20 years ago...

398
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,360
She's 34 years old now, so back then,

399
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,560
she must've been 13 years old.

400
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,480
Can she have been involved in prostitution?

401
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,240
I see. This jerk must have bought sexual services from her.

402
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,160
And she used that fact to threaten him.

403
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,840
Is the victim's name Han Jin Sook?

404
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,800
Darn it. The resolution is too low.

405
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,360
Jae Geun must've recognized her when he saw that.

406
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,120
That must've been why he went to her place...

407
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,000
and checked her childhood photo.

408
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,120
Jae Geun said he had something to tell me.

409
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,360
He must've wanted to tell me who this man is, right?

410
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,520
Gwang Gyun.

411
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,080
They've restored the security camera footage of Han Jin Sook's case.

412
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,960
- What? - It's unbelievable.

413
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,240
Like I said,

414
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,320
the man wearing a watch here...

415
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
ordered this man with a missing finger...

416
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,200
to kill Han Jin Sook.

417
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
A million dollars is a big amount indeed.

418
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,360
No, I don't think it was about money.

419
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,080
They tortured her, killed her, and just left the body as it is.

420
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,760
There must be some other reason.

421
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,680
If the teenage prostitution occurred...

422
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,880
in that bar named Pumpkin Singer or something,

423
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,560
its owner must have been involved in it, right?

424
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,520
What kind of a scum would do that?

425
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
It was a 13-year-old girl.

426
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,120
That woman who owned that place is just as bad.

427
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,280
Tell me about it.

428
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,720
Let's find that bar owner first.

429
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,560
Okay. I asked Moojin Regional Police Agency...

430
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,360
for data on the arrested hostesses...

431
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,080
when they cracked down on those hostess bars.

432
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,480
If we ask around them,

433
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,000
we'll be able to find the owner of Pumpkin Singer.

434
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,440
Let's be careful.

435
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,280
He killed someone to cover up the fact that he was involved in...

436
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,720
teenage prostitution 20 years ago.

437
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,280
It doesn't look like he's an ordinary man.

438
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,880
Darn it.

439
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,760
Detective Na Gwang Gyun?

440
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,640
Yes?

441
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,560
It's an express delivery from Moojin Regional Police Agency.

442
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,680
Dad.

443
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,360
When did you get so old?

444
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,480
Hi, Mr. Hwang.

445
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,280
I'm visiting my dad.

446
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
What?

447
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,840
Is... Is that true?

448
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,680
Okay.

449
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,720
What's going on?

450
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,800
She said Mr. Song wasn't going to die.

451
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,960
Man Ho will be here soon.

452
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,760
Dad, I'll come back later.

453
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,480
Did you hear?

454
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,960
Mr. Song Jae Geun, the commissioner general and your close friend.

455
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,280
You know him well, right?

456
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,520
He died in a sudden car accident last night.

457
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
(I love you, Leo)

458
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,760
- Leo! - Here, Leo!

459
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,600
- Leo! - I love you!

460
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,840
Take a close look.

461
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,040
Someone around Leo must have...

462
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Hey.

463
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,440
Hey, Ha Ram. Look.

464
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,160
Don't touch me. You're distracting me.

465
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,200
What do you like about that rude brat?

466
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,720
- Leo! - Leo!

467
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,640
Are you in a bad mood?

468
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,040
Meet me here after work.

469
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,600
I will make you feel better.

470
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,560
- Hello. - Hello.

471
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,120
- Hello. - Hello.

472
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,440
You're new.

473
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm the new member. It's a pleasure to work with you.

474
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,600
You're cute.

475
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,920
Wait for me there after this.

476
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,080
I'm sorry?

477
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,520
What are you doing? Wait outside if you're done.

478
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,720
What is it?

479
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,000
It's about the threatening letter.

480
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,560
I just couldn't get it off my mind...

481
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,840
What do you think?

482
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,720
He has an overwhelming aura in person.

483
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,200
This is the first time I saw him in person.

484
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,240
Do you think I asked you how he looked in person?

485
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,520
Why are you yelling all of a sudden?

486
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,840
No one here has a shadow.

487
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Come here.

488
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,560
(Dressing Room)

489
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,880
That witch.

490
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,040
She always comes on to Leo.

491
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,320
She tries so hard to be seen in public with Leo.

492
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,480
Who's Mi Soon?

493
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,679
She's over there.

494
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,840
What do you think? Take a look.

495
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,040
She doesn't have it.

496
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,400
- She doesn't? - No.

497
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,840
It's 10 minutes before the live broadcast!

498
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,160
Please do the final check!

499
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,320
I didn't wait three hours for this.

500
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,480
Are you looking at them closely?

501
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,800
Don't miss a single person. Check all of them.

502
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,720
Here. Drink this, and be more enthusiastic.

503
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,880
Keep your eyes wide open, okay?

504
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,760
You punk. Are you kidding me?

505
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,960
This is a serious problem!

506
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,840
You're on drugs, aren't you?

507
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,920
What did you just say? Drugs?

508
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,640
You're the one who begged us to have him here.

509
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,480
How dare you. You think you're a big man now.

510
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,760
You used to give out bread to the staff every morning!

511
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,120
Where do you think you're going?

512
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,240
- Hey! Stop right there! - Please stop.

513
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,920
Where do you think you're going?

514
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,000
(Leo from the Star)

515
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,160
I feel like my eyes will fall out soon. No one has it.

516
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,000
They're okay. They haven't fallen out yet.

517
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,280
Take a good look even inside of their bodies.

518
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,880
I've looked at all of them. Maybe...

519
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,440
the letter was just a prank.

520
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,320
Detective!

521
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,960
We have a problem. Leo disappeared.

522
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,680
He disappeared while I was arguing with the director.

523
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,960
He wasn't in the dressing room or the restroom either.

524
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,440
That letter...

525
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,680
That crazy jerk.

526
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,400
How dare he tries to hurt my dear Leo?

527
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,760
Joon, check that side. I'll check this side.

528
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,240
If you find him, call me right away.

529
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,560
Backup. Call for backup right away.

530
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,000
Do it right now. Do you understand?

531
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,720
Leo...

532
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,760
How dare she order me around?

533
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,080
My gosh.

534
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,920
Goodness.

535
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,520
Sir. Excuse me.

536
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,600
Have you seen Leo...

537
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,080
You can't be here. You'll die if you stay here.

538
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,560
Move over there now.

539
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,000
It'll be too late at this rate.

540
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
No!

541
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,600
No...

542
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,480
No. No!

543
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,160
Come here, and hold her hand!

544
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,120
Give me your hand. Give it to me.

545
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Hurry up. Come on! Give me your hand.

546
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,720
Hurry up. Hurry.

547
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,440
Hold my hand. Come on. Hurry up.

548
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,880
Hurry up.

549
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,160
Give me your hand.

550
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,240
I got you.

551
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,560
Hold on tight. Don't let go.

552
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,520
Hold onto my hand.

553
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,640
She's coming up.

554
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,240
No.

555
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,000
My gosh. My goodness.

556
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,160
Are you okay?

557
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
My gosh.

558
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,720
I can't believe you did that.

559
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,960
Why would you try to kill yourself?

560
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,160
I don't know what you're going through.

561
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,360
But how do you think your family would feel after you die?

562
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,960
You should think about your mom and dad.

563
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,080
Mom.

564
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,040
Dad.

565
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,800
Mom.

566
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,720
Mom.

567
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,760
Mom.

568
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,560
I'm sorry.

569
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm sorry.

570
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,240
Mom.

571
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,440
What a bunch of worthless people...

572
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,160
who deserve to have their heads stuck in the toilet.

573
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,520
Are you saying that the writer and the director...

574
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,560
stole the script that you worked on for years?

575
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,800
Yes.

576
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,080
And you just let them get away with that?

577
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,720
You should've dragged them to the broadcasting station...

578
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,560
and revealed everything to the staff.

579
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,200
The broadcasting station's on their side anyway.

580
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,800
That drama's already been scheduled to air on TV.

581
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,640
So they're scared that I might ruin their drama's reputation.

582
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,960
Because of that, they won't even meet me.

583
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,560
On top of that, they even released an article saying that...

584
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,160
I'm purposely trying to ruin the drama.

585
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,360
They said a rookie writer's trying to get her share by acting up.

586
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,440
And they told me that ruining a nameless writer's career...

587
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,800
is going to be a piece of cake.

588
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,360
In the end, I'll be the only one who's gone crazy.

589
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,440
And things just ended like that.

590
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,960
Still, you shouldn't have tried to kill yourself.

591
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,840
What would you get out of that?

592
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,840
You should fight until the end.

593
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,640
I'm exhausted.

594
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,840
I'm so exhausted.

595
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,760
I don't have the strength to fight anymore.

596
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,400
Then you should sue them.

597
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,400
Where am I going to get the money to pay for a lawsuit?

598
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,640
I can barely earn enough money to pay for this month's food and rent.

599
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,360
But you shouldn't have tried to commit suicide.

600
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,760
I thought they'd at least feel guilty for what they did...

601
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,360
if I fell and died from the rooftop of this broadcasting station.

602
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,560
I thought maybe...

603
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,880
someone might acknowledge how upset I must've felt.

604
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,040
How naive of you.

605
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,560
If they were going to care about you just because you died,

606
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,160
no one would've stolen your drama,

607
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,040
and no one would've taken their sides in the first place.

608
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
He's right.

609
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,600
Yes, Leo's right.

610
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,480
If you die like this, you'll end up having died for nothing.

611
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,320
- Hello? - Where are you?

612
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,560
I found Leo.

613
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,320
Okay, I'll be right down.

614
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,440
My gosh, I got worried thinking that you got attacked by the terrorist.

615
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,840
Thank you.

616
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,640
- Let's go. - This way.

617
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,000
Thank you.

618
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,840
Try to hang in there.

619
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,120
You may be lonely and exhausted right now.

620
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,840
But I'm sure someone will be there to take your side one day.

621
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,360
I'm on your side too.

622
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,480
Thank you.

623
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,040
What does that mean?

624
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,000
By any chance, did you...

625
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,840
Yes. She had a shadow.

626
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,240
Did you save her?

627
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,320
No.

628
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,400
I was one step too late.

629
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,120
Leo saved her.

630
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
- Leo saved her? - I told you, didn't I?

631
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,040
I told you that he must be a good guy.

632
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,160
I'm glad you weren't the one who saved her.

633
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,720
What?

634
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
Whatever.

635
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,280
My gosh, you surprised me. What are you doing here?

636
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,080
I was waiting for you, but then I got hungry.

637
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,400
So I was going to eat only a little bit.

638
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,760
Don't act like I'm your sister.

639
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,280
You and I aren't even related by blood.

640
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,280
What are you doing here?

641
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,360
Mom told me to give you this.

642
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,400
What's this?

643
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,480
What? Why did she give me money?

644
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,160
I told Mom...

645
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,800
that Dad stole money from you.

646
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,600
Then they started fighting with each other.

647
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,040
Mom told me to give this to you.

648
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,680
But I was worried that a thief might take it if I just left it there.

649
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,080
So I waited for you to come, but I became really hungry.

650
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,840
Is this all you have for me?

651
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,120
She said she'll give you the rest as soon as she gets paid this month.

652
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,560
Ha Ram, Mom spent the entire day making these.

653
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,640
You can eat the whole thing, you pig.

654
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,080
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

655
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,240
Come on, Ha Ram.

656
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,440
Don't be like that.

657
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,120
My gosh, why did you try to stop the door?

658
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,760
Let me see. Show me where it hurts.

659
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,240
Don't overreact. I didn't even close it that hard.

660
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,320
Come over here.

661
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,560
What's this? What is this?

662
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,800
I don't know. I just got it.

663
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,240
You don't get bruises for no reason.

664
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,880
Let me see.

665
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,680
Do you think I'm stupid?

666
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,840
(Royeol Hospital)

667
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,880
Are you really going to be like this?

668
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,160
She's going to die soon.

669
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,840
You should at least see her face before she dies.

670
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,000
I know you've been living like strangers for about 20 years.

671
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,080
But you're going to regret it if you just let her die like this.

672
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,240
Why are you swearing at me?

673
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,560
I can't even feed my own child properly these days...

674
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,240
because I need to take care of her.

675
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,360
Whatever. I really did my best.

676
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,680
So you can do whatever you want now.

677
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,080
I guess she's not your real sister.

678
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,560
No. She's my cousin.

679
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,400
But what happened to her?

680
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,480
- Did she get into an accident? - Yes.

681
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,200
She lived in the Philippines for a long time.

682
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,640
And she apparently fell into the sea from a cliff.

683
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,560
She was transferred here from the Philippines...

684
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,960
because the doctors there said she had no hope.

685
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,800
But the doctors here just say the same thing.

686
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,840
My goodness.

687
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,280
But it seems like she isn't in good terms with her husband.

688
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,160
It's a long story.

689
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,880
Come on. Follow me. Hurry up, and come inside.

690
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,240
What are you doing here?

691
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,000
Was I not enough?

692
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,760
Did you have to make him get beaten up like this as well?

693
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,760
What did you do to make him get beaten up like this?

694
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,480
Be quiet. Let's go outside.

695
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,080
I asked you a question!

696
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,440
If you ran away, you should've at least gotten yourself a better man.

697
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,160
Why must you always meet such reckless jerks?

698
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,720
And while you may be responsible for making that decision,

699
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,920
what about Hoon Seok or me?

700
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,240
You're worse than the guys who abuse us.

701
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,000
Don't get angry at Mom.

702
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,520
I hate you. You're so mean.

703
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,760
Let's go. Follow me.

704
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,400
No, I'm going to stay with Mom.

705
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,880
It's okay. It'll be okay. Don't cry.

706
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,720
- It's okay. - How touching.

707
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,280
People might mistake you guys as real mother and son.

708
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,160
Do whatever you want!

709
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,360
Is this the police station?

710
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,440
I'd like to make a report on domestic violence.

711
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,000
Are you still alive?

712
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,240
Please just die.

713
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,280
Stop tormenting me!

714
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,640
Please just die!

715
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,080
- Get off me! Let go! - My gosh.

716
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,560
Please just die!

717
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,320
Yes, I'd like to make a report on domestic violence.

718
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,320
The address is...

719
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,920
Hyo Jin, I told you not to call me during working hours.

720
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,480
Your birthday present?

721
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,480
Okay. Send me the photo. I'm going to hang up now.

722
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,320
My gosh.

723
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,120
Man Soo.

724
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,040
He must have something to say to you.

725
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,560
- Hey. - What?

726
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,720
You were staring at him because you have something to say to him.

727
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,480
Mr. Pumpkin.

728
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,080
Did the murderer of your wife get caught yet?

729
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,880
I hope they catch him soon.

730
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,440
Forget that. Just don't come here if you can.

731
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,400
There's no good in seeing each other like this.

732
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,760
- Something must be on your mind. - What?

733
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,400
Whenever something's on your mind,

734
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,720
you come to this shabby place to drink...

735
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,480
because people bother you if you go to other bars.

736
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,400
My gosh, you're good.

737
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,520
Try working at a bar for 10 years.

738
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,320
It'll only be a matter of time before you become a fortune teller.

739
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,160
That reminds me of Ms. Fortune-teller.

740
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,400
"Ms. Fortune-teller"?

741
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,800
Who's that?

742
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,440
She's just this person I know.

743
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,880
You must like her.

744
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,440
No, it's not what you think. It seriously isn't.

745
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,160
I, Oh Man Soo,

746
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,800
like women who are sexy.

747
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,240
Okay, okay. She must be the complete opposite of sexy.

748
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,080
My gosh.

749
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,960
I was completely relying on Ms. Fortune-teller.

750
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,720
I lost so much money on him.

751
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,600
I wonder where a policeman...

752
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,520
got that much money to buy so much insurance.

753
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,160
I should make up for the loss by attracting a lot of clients...

754
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,560
during this year's Halloween party.

755
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,880
- A Halloween party? - Yes.

756
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,000
It's to keep a good relationship with our VVIP clients,

757
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,240
and we're also going to attract new clients.

758
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,160
If it's a Halloween party,

759
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,280
are people going to be wearing masks and stuff like they do in movies?

760
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,560
That sounds like fun.

761
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,920
You should come too, Tiffany.

762
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,720
How can I? You said it's just for VVIP clients.

763
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,760
Come on. All my friends are coming too.

764
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,520
We're friends. Don't you remember?

765
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,400
When you drove me home from the police station that day,

766
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,760
you and I agreed to be friends.

767
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,480
"Friends"? Can I really go?

768
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,080
Of course.

769
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,080
I've always wanted to attend those kinds of parties.

770
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,720
Nice.

771
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,360
She wants an expensive game machine.

772
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,560
What is it?

773
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,640
It's my daughter. She's asking me to buy her a birthday present.

774
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,200
When can you get me the address for the remaining list of people?

775
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,360
Detective Park's looking into it.

776
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,160
So I think we'll be able to get everything within a day or two.

777
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,720
We're here.

778
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,320
Let me see. Whose house is this?

779
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,000
It's her house. She used to work at Pumpkin Singer.

780
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,600
Her real name is Hwang Mi Ja.

781
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,000
"Hwang Mi Ja"?

782
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,200
"Santorini"?

783
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,640
Wait. Let me see. Santorini.

784
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,000
This is where Han Jin Sook's husband works.

785
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Yes.

786
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,960
Hello. Welcome.

787
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,120
We're the police.

788
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,080
Is there a woman named Hwang Mi Ja here?

789
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,280
Mi Ja?

790
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,440
She's our boss. Why are you looking for her?

791
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,960
We had something to ask her about.

792
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,880
So can you tell her that we'd like to meet her?

793
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,440
She's not here right now. She's in Japan.

794
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,120
Really? When is she coming back?

795
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,760
She said she'll start coming to work again by next week.

796
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,120
Okay, we'll come back.

797
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,040
Thank you.

798
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
I wonder why the police are looking for Mi Ja.

799
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,800
- Hey. - Hello.

800
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,480
What brings you here?

801
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,200
Do you have more questions for me?

802
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,960
I was just wondering...

803
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,000
if Ms. Hwang Mi Ja was acquainted to your wife.

804
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,600
Yes, she's the woman I told you about. They used to...

805
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,840
work together back in their hometown.

806
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,520
I was able to get a job here because I had met her through my wife.

807
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Then out of all the guys that your wife was close to,

808
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,480
have you ever seen a guy wearing a watch that looks like this?

809
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,280
No.

810
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,240
I've never seen that watch before.

811
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,760
(Royeol Insurance)

812
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,520
My gosh, what is this?

813
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,240
These people are throwing money everywhere.

814
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,560
Do they think this is the US or something?

815
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,320
If they want to celebrate a holiday, they should celebrate...

816
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,960
something that's more traditional.

817
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,360
- These people are so weird. - Hey, Ms. Fortune-teller.

818
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,160
People with low income are starving, and they're holding a party.

819
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,240
- Ms. Fortune-teller. - Yes?

820
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,200
You said...

821
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,600
Mr. Song won't die.

822
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,760
He passed away a couple of days ago from a car accident.

823
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,840
Really?

824
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,600
Did he really pass away?

825
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
Yes.

826
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,600
But he didn't have a shadow.

827
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,120
There's nothing I can do about sudden car accidents...

828
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,800
because I can't be around everyone for 24 hours straight.

829
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,880
What about Lee Jung Bae's files?

830
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,040
I won't say anything more since he's already dead.

831
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,600
But please look more carefully from now on. Okay?

832
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,640
And here.

833
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,760
Leo's also coming to this party.

834
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,320
You can prepare your own costume.

835
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,760
Wait. Why would I attend this party?

836
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,480
I'm not free to go to a party that's made for Western ghosts.

837
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm not asking you to come and have fun.

838
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,640
I'm asking you to come and work.

839
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,360
Every single young VVIP client of our company...

840
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,800
will be attending this party.

841
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,680
You won't have to go here and there by wasting money on transportation.

842
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,800
You'll be able to see if people are going to die or not in one spot.

843
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,320
So why would you not come?

844
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,960
This is also part of your work.

845
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,400
If you don't come to this party, I'm going to fire you.

846
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,720
You're going to get fired.

847
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,080
I'm also going to burn all those files.

848
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,120
You're asking an awful lot for a single document.

849
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,480
Fine, I'll go.

850
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,720
My goodness. You're just a puppet CEO.

851
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,280
What?

852
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,120
What did you just say?

853
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,480
- I said you're just a puppet CEO. - What...

854
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,480
- You puppet CEO. - What... What... Hey!

855
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,280
I'm going to fire you right now. I'm going to let you go.

856
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,320
You're fired!

857
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
- My gosh. - I love you.

858
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,920
I love you!

859
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,320
- My gosh. - He's so handsome.

860
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,280
Why are they all so young?

861
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,560
That person is supposed to be in his 40s.

862
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,600
Joon. Joon.

863
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,360
What took you so long?

864
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,880
I had to take care of something at work.

865
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,400
Nothing happened, right?

866
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,800
My gosh, he's so good-looking.

867
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,520
He's unbelievably handsome.

868
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,880
He's not handsome.

869
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,120
No one even lines up like this for the king of the underworld.

870
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,600
How pathetic.

871
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,000
Why do they bother to come here so early in the morning?

872
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,440
Look around carefully.

873
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,520
Why isn't he showing up after having sent that letter?

874
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,640
Why would he show up at such a public area?

875
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,440
If it were me, I'd kill him secretly.

876
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,120
Or he could also try to kill him...

877
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,800
in a dark place like a nightclub, so that his face won't get revealed.

878
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,720
That's right.

879
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,680
Joon.

880
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,680
He said Leo's going to be there too.

881
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,200
Wait. Here. Don't you think he'll come to this party?

882
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,000
What's this? "Halloween"?

883
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
What's this?

884
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,080
Isn't it obvious?

885
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,200
It's the Grim Reaper.

886
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,440
The Grim Reaper?

887
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,200
No way.

888
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,440
Your imaginations are unbelievable.

889
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,320
This is not what Grim Reapers look like.

890
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,520
They look very gentle on the outside, you know.

891
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,880
And what's this black cloak? It's so tacky.

892
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,520
Humans are so pathetic.

893
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,240
They don't even know anything, but they act like they do.

894
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
What?

895
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,120
What?

896
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,480
Where did he go?

897
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,440
Oh, right. Tomorrow's the day of the party.

898
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,920
He told me to prepare my own costume.

899
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,000
Joon. Joon.

900
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,960
How does this look?

901
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,440
I look quite elegant,

902
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,920
so I think I should dress up as a princess.

903
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,960
It doesn't suit you.

904
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,600
Really?

905
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,440
Then...

906
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,920
Here. What do you think about this?

907
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,000
What about this?

908
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,640
Why do you have so many stuff in your hands?

909
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,520
- This is for you. - Me?

910
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,640
Yes. I want you to wear this for tomorrow's party.

911
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,720
And don't forget to bring the props inside.

912
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,600
- I don't want to. - Gosh, wait!

913
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,280
They won't let us in if we're not wearing Halloween costumes.

914
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,240
We must guard Leo, you know.

915
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,160
Take it. Here. Let's go now.

916
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,760
I must say, humans do all sorts of ridiculous things.

917
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,320
She'll eventually show up where Han Moo Gang is.

918
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,640
I'd like to know about the flights to Chicago.

919
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,400
For tomorrow.

920
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,160
I can't believe Joon picked this out of all the costumes.

921
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,640
Well, it's not too bad. I mean, I'm still a princess.

922
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,320
What is this?

923
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,800
I can't tell who anyone is if I can't see their faces.

924
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,800
(List of Royeol Hospital's VVIP Clients)

925
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,600
Is Joon not here yet?

926
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,600
Ms. Fortune-teller?

927
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,920
Oh, Boss!

928
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,560
How much did you pay for your costume?

929
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,920
Mine was 50 dollars, but I haggled and got it down to 20 dollars.

930
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,720
20 dollars? My goodness.

931
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,720
Mine was 2,000 dollars. 2,000 dollars.

932
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,520
Look at this lovely couple!

933
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,400
You two look so cute together.

934
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,960
- Stand here. Let me take a picture. - Goodness.

935
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,160
- Stop it! - Really? Sure, do it.

936
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,560
All right. There.

937
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,800
Try to look more affectionate towards each other. Okay?

938
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,640
Affectionate?

939
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,280
1, 2.

940
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,720
Joon.

941
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,480
Joon.

942
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,920
I'm wearing the outfit you picked.

943
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,080
Are we good now?

944
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,160
You look incredible.

945
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,480
You'd definitely outshine Brad Pitt if he were here.

946
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,640
What was that glare about? Goodness.

947
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,920
Is he dressed as Joe Black? That movie is ancient.

948
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,800
Who is that man?

949
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,920
He's so stylish.

950
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,880
Gosh, what on earth are you wearing? I can't help but compare you two.

951
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,680
Who put this outfit together for you?

952
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,080
I paid 2,000...

953
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,000
For goodness' sake.

954
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,280
- That guy is so dashing. - He's really handsome.

955
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,520
- What's that girl doing with him? - Who's that frog?

956
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,280
By the way, why did you want me to hold this?

957
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,520
Joon, Joe Black isn't complete without this.

958
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,720
Hold the jar like this...

959
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,440
and take a spoonful.

960
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,920
Then suck on it.

961
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,400
Here, open your mouth.

962
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,160
It's sweet.

963
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,880
I like this. It's good.

964
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,080
- Where's that rude jerk? - Leo?

965
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,200
- I don't think he's here yet. - Is that why...

966
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,000
you were hanging out with that green monster over there?

967
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,080
Goodness. How can a detective be so good-looking?

968
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,240
How annoying.

969
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,040
Hang on.

970
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,840
Did I invite him?

971
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
Gosh, you startled me.

972
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,960
Hey, I'll have a nightmare about this.

973
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,520
Are you observing everyone for the shadow that might be inside?

974
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,600
Don't you worry.

975
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,520
I'm watching everyone with eyes like a hawk.

976
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,120
Why are so many people dressed in black?

977
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,320
How can we search in this place?

978
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,080
Sorry? What did you say?

979
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,160
You don't need to know.

980
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,360
You're not here to play. Keep looking for him, okay?

981
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,320
This is Philip... I mean, Steven Yoo.

982
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,760
His parents helped me out a lot when I was studying abroad.

983
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Hi, man.

984
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,240
I'm not having a good day, so don't talk to me. Just go have fun.

985
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,440
Let's go, Steven.

986
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,560
Hey, you absolutely cannot drink. You better stick to soda.

987
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,680
Who is he?

988
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,120
My nephew.

989
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,800
I see. By the way, this party must've cost you a fortune.

990
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,520
Don't worry about such things. Just focus on observing our clients.

991
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,960
I didn't invite you here for you to have fun.

992
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,560
I'm not playing around.

993
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,600
I'm observing everyone with eyes like a hawk right now.

994
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,760
Go over there. Go there, and get some work done. Seriously.

995
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,600
What an oddball.

996
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,200
Why that little...

997
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,400
Moo Gang.

998
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,080
A position became available at a hospital in the States.

999
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,400
I had to leave in a hurry. I'm sorry.

1000
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,520
I couldn't even say goodbye to you in person.

1001
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,280
Kim Sun Young.

1002
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,240
Why are you calling me just now?

1003
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,480
You kept me waiting for so long.

1004
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,560
How could you...

1005
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,320
It's easy to miss what's right in front of you.

1006
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,280
Come here immediately if you want to save your boyfriend's life.

1007
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,080
- It's Leo. - Oh, my gosh!

1008
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,480
- He's so hot. - I know, right?

1009
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,800
Look who's here.

1010
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,280
Long time no see.

1011
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,680
The one in the witch costume... Isn't she that girl?

1012
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,520
From the bar where we got into a fight after making a prank call...

1013
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,960
about bombing the National Assembly Proceeding Hall.

1014
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,960
Didn't she go to the police station with us?

1015
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,200
But how did that wench get into this party?

1016
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,400
I invited her.

1017
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,240
You did? Why?

1018
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,760
Because we're friends.

1019
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,120
Friends?

1020
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,400
Hey, why are you even friends with a bar girl?

1021
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,120
Byung Ho. Watch your language, will you?

1022
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,600
And you better not address my friends disrespectfully.

1023
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,600
You're disrespecting me as well.

1024
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,320
All right.

1025
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,640
Don't get worked up over something so petty.

1026
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,360
Don't smoke, okay?

1027
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,320
Sang Min.

1028
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,400
Do you want one?

1029
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,000
Do I look like a kid? I quit a long time ago.

1030
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,320
But these aren't cigarettes.

1031
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,120
Hey, you made it.

1032
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,320
Yes.

1033
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,760
Please don't cause any trouble today, okay?

1034
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,200
I'll be right back.

1035
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,640
That jerk...

1036
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,920
I don't spend time with customers outside the bar.

1037
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,640
Gosh, that petty wench is provoking me.

1038
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,360
- Gosh! You can't be doing this. - Let go of her!

1039
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,720
- You really shouldn't do this. - Let go!

1040
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,240
- I'll apologize on his behalf. - He's usually not like that.

1041
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,560
Don't side with him.

1042
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,680
All right.

1043
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,600
What do you think? You said you've never been to a place like this.

1044
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,000
I feel as if I'm in a completely different world.

1045
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,120
I thought it'd be exciting,

1046
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,520
but I'm uncomfortable.

1047
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,640
I don't feel like I belong here.

1048
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,560
That's not true.

1049
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,520
Can I take this home?

1050
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,080
Hyo Jin loves carrot cake.

1051
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,720
Sure thing.

1052
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,200
I'll tell my kitchen staff to pack a few things for you...

1053
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,760
before you leave.

1054
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,320
Hyo Jin will get to pig out today.

1055
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,080
Oh, right. I left her birthday gift in my room upstairs.

1056
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,840
- Don't forget to take it. - A gift?

1057
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,320
I peeped on her text message on your phone.

1058
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,880
The game machine?

1059
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,360
Thank you so much, Man Soo. Gosh, every time...

1060
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,280
Don't mention it. Don't forget to take it when you leave.

1061
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,120
Microphone check. The couple for today's main stage.

1062
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,760
It's the green prince and the green princess show!

1063
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,480
It's dance time.

1064
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,200
Boss, come on. The insurance payouts.

1065
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,720
We need to make up for all the insurance payouts. Come on.

1066
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,960
Let's do this.

1067
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,920
A lovely couple?

1068
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,479
They don't suit each other at all.

1069
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,720
Moo Gang.

1070
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,240
You look dashing today.

1071
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,000
I've never seen you dressed like this.

1072
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,560
Why am I feeling this way again?

1073
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,359
Why do I get like this every time I see this doctor?

1074
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,960
I've decided to move to the States and study more.

1075
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,279
I had to leave in a hurry.

1076
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,359
So I came to say goodbye to you.

1077
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,479
You could at least try to look sad.

1078
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,640
What on earth are you doing now?

1079
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,680
Moo Gang.

1080
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,800
Take care, Moo Gang.

1081
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,600
What is this now?

1082
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,080
Why does my heart ache?

1083
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,440
I'm really sorry, Moo Gang.

1084
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,400
But I'll repent for the rest of my life.

1085
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,240
Repent?

1086
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,480
Don't try too hard to regain your memory.

1087
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,960
That's probably better for your sake.

1088
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,840
Hey, isn't this when people kiss?

1089
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,000
- Yes! - Yes!

1090
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,720
Look! Look at this.

1091
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,960
I paid 2,000 dollars for this glow-in-the-dark paint.

1092
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,560
Yours doesn't glow in the dark, right?

1093
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,920
What's this? What's going on?

1094
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,720
Please turn on the lights. The lights!

1095
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,840
The lights must be turned back on. Please turn on the lights!

1096
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,920
The lights must go back on!

1097
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,360
Who was it?

1098
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,720
Who was it? I clearly saw...

1099
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,040
Where did he go? Where did he disappear to?

1100
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,680
Where did that doctor go?

1101
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,560
What's your problem?

1102
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,240
It's him. Yes.

1103
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,680
I must make sure that jerk doesn't bother me anymore.

1104
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,040
(World Drink)

1105
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,360
What do you want?

1106
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,600
I should've killed him.

1107
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,320
Kim Sun Young.

1108
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,200
Get off, you jerk.

1109
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,440
Pull over. Pull over!

1110
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,600
I said, pull over!

1111
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,440
Moo Gang!

1112
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,800
How dare you, human.

1113
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,480
Things will get complicated for me if you kill Han Moo Gang.

1114
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,960
If you ever try to kill him again...

1115
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,200
You should've laid low and behaved yourself when I let you live.

1116
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,280
No. Joon, no!

1117
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,520
That woman...

1118
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,080
will be so sad.

1119
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,040
Moo Gang! No!

1120
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,680
Moo Gang!

1121
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,080
Moo Gang!

1122
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,160
Moo Gang.

1123
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,760
Moo Gang!

1124
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,680
What's happening?

1125
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,920
Why can't I get out of here?

1126
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,760
(Black)

1127
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,920
He kills someone else...

1128
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,520
- before he kills your father. - Hurry up!

1129
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,320
Why didn't I think of that?

1130
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,480
That's...

1131
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,720
- That shadow back then... - No!

1132
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,920
Who is it?

1133
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,280
Where is that tape?

1134
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,360
What is going on? Have I really becoming a human?

1135
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,600
He'll die very soon.

1136
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,520
Why are you lying?

1137
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,960
You must tell me honestly.

1138
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,040
How is this possible?
